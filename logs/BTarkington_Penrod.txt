Parsing [sent. 1 len. 40]: PENROD By Booth Tarkington To ohn , Donald And Booth Jameson From A Grateful Uncle CHAPTER I A BOY AND HIS DOG Penrod sat morosely upon the back fence and gazed with envy at Duke , his wistful dog .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 22]: A bitter soul dominated the various curved and angular surfaces known by a careless world as the face of Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 30]: Except in solitude , that face was almost always cryptic and emotionless ; for Penrod had come into his twelfth year wearing an expression carefully trained to be inscrutable .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 26]: Since the world was sure to misunderstand everything , mere defensive instinct prompted him to give it as little as possible to lay hold upon .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 65]: Nothing is more impenetrable than the face of a boy who has learned this , and Penrod 's was habitually as fathomless as the depth of his hatred this morning for the literary activities of Mrs. Lora Rewbush -- an almost universally respected fellow citizen , a lady of charitable and poetic inclinations , and one of his own mother 's most intimate friends .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 50]: Mrs. Lora Rewbush had written something which she called `` The Children 's Pageant of the Table Round , '' and it was to be performed in public that very afternoon at the Women 's Arts and Guild Hall for the benefit of the Coloured Infants ' Betterment Society .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 65]: And if any flavour of sweetness remained in the nature of Penrod Schofield after the dismal trials of the school-week just past , that problematic , infinitesimal remnant was made pungent acid by the imminence of his destiny to form a prominent feature of the spectacle , and to declaim the loathsome sentiments of a character named upon the programme the Child Sir Lancelot .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 58]: After each rehearsal he had plotted escape , and only ten days earlier there had been a glimmer of light : Mrs. Lora Rewbush caught a very bad cold , and it was hoped it might develop into pneumonia ; but she recovered so quickly that not even a rehearsal of the Children 's Pageant was postponed .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 4]: Darkness closed in .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 48]: Penrod had rather vaguely debated plans for a self-mutilation such as would make his appearance as the Child Sir Lancelot inexpedient on public grounds ; it was a heroic and attractive thought , but the results of some extremely sketchy preliminary experiments caused him to abandon it .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 15]: There was no escape ; and at last his hour was hard upon him .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 15]: Therefore he brooded on the fence and gazed with envy at his wistful Duke .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 22]: The dog 's name was undescriptive of his person , which was obviously the result of a singular series of mesalliances .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 22]: He wore a grizzled moustache and indefinite whiskers ; he was small and shabby , and looked like an old postman .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 19]: Penrod envied Duke because he was sure Duke would never be compelled to be a Child Sir Lancelot .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 16]: He thought a dog free and unshackled to go or come as the wind listeth .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 8]: Penrod forgot the life he led Duke .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 46]: There was a long soliloquy upon the fence , a plaintive monologue without words : the boy 's thoughts were adjectives , but they were expressed by a running film of pictures in his mind 's eye , morbidly prophetic of the hideosities before him .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 24]: Finally he spoke aloud , with such spleen that Duke rose from his haunches and lifted one ear in keen anxiety . '' '
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 17]: I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake , the Child , Gentul-hearted , meek , and mild .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 19]: What though I 'm BUT a littul child , Gentul-hearted , meek , and -- ' OOF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 23]: All of this except `` oof '' was a quotation from the Child Sir Lancelot , as conceived by Mrs. Lora Rewbush .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 71]: Choking upon it , Penrod slid down from the fence , and with slow and thoughtful steps entered a one-storied wing of the stable , consisting of a single apartment , floored with cement and used as a storeroom for broken bric-a-brac , old paint-buckets , decayed garden-hose , worn-out carpets , dead furniture , and other condemned odds and ends not yet considered hopeless enough to be given away .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 56]: In one corner stood a large box , a part of the building itself : it was eight feet high and open at the top , and it had been constructed as a sawdust magazine from which was drawn material for the horse 's bed in a stall on the other side of the partition .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 41]: The big box , so high and towerlike , so commodious , so suggestive , had ceased to fulfil its legitimate function ; though , providentially , it had been at least half full of sawdust when the horse died .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 31]: Two years had gone by since that passing ; an interregnum in transportation during which Penrod 's father was `` thinking '' -LRB- he explained sometimes -RRB- of an automobile .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 21]: Meanwhile , the gifted and generous sawdust-box had served brilliantly in war and peace : it was Penrod 's stronghold .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 27]: There was a partially defaced sign upon the front wall of the box ; the donjon-keep had known mercantile impulses : The O. K. RaBiT Co. .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 5]: PENROD ScHoFiELD AND CO. .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 29]: iNQuiRE FOR PRicEs This was a venture of the preceding vacation , and had netted , at one time , an accrued and owed profit of $ 1.38 .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 11]: Prospects had been brightest on the very eve of cataclysm .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 59]: The storeroom was locked and guarded , but twenty-seven rabbits and Belgian hares , old and young , had perished here on a single night -- through no human agency , but in a foray of cats , the besiegers treacherously tunnelling up through the sawdust from the small aperture which opened into the stall beyond the partition .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 5]: Commerce has its martyrs .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 41]: Penrod climbed upon a barrel , stood on tiptoe , grasped the rim of the box ; then , using a knot-hole as a stirrup , threw one leg over the top , drew himself up , and dropped within .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 17]: Standing upon the packed sawdust , he was just tall enough to see over the top .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 22]: Duke had not followed him into the storeroom , but remained near the open doorway in a concave and pessimistic attitude .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 34]: Penrod felt in a dark corner of the box and laid hands upon a simple apparatus consisting of an old bushel-basket with a few yards of clothes-line tied to each of its handles .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 61]: He passed the ends of the lines over a big spool , which revolved upon an axle of wire suspended from a beam overhead , and , with the aid of this improvised pulley , lowered the empty basket until it came to rest in an upright position upon the floor of the storeroom at the foot of the sawdust-box .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 4]: `` Eleva-ter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 3]: shouted Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 4]: `` Ting-ting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 21]: Duke , old and intelligently apprehensive , approached slowly , in a semicircular manner , deprecatingly , but with courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 33]: He pawed the basket delicately ; then , as if that were all his master had expected of him , uttered one bright bark , sat down , and looked up triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 21]: His hypocrisy was shallow : many a horrible quarter of an hour had taught him his duty in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 4]: `` El-e-VAY-ter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 4]: shouted Penrod sternly .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 12]: `` You want me to come down there to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 5]: Duke looked suddenly haggard .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 19]: He pawed the basket feebly again and , upon another outburst from on high , prostrated himself flat .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 12]: Again threatened , he gave a superb impersonation of a worm .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 8]: `` You get in that el-e-VAY-ter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 39]: Reckless with despair , Duke jumped into the basket , landing in a dishevelled posture , which he did not alter until he had been drawn up and poured out upon the floor of sawdust with the box .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 13]: There , shuddering , he lay in doughnut shape and presently slumbered .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 45]: It was dark in the box , a condition that might have been remedied by sliding back a small wooden panel on runners , which would have let in ample light from the alley ; but Penrod Schofield had more interesting means of illumination .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 52]: He knelt , and from a former soap-box , in a corner , took a lantern , without a chimney , and a large oil-can , the leak in the latter being so nearly imperceptible that its banishment from household use had seemed to Penrod as inexplicable as it was providential .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 20]: He shook the lantern near his ear : nothing splashed ; there was no sound but a dry clinking .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 24]: But there was plenty of kerosene in the can ; and he filled the lantern , striking a match to illumine the operation .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 15]: Then he lit the lantern and hung it upon a nail against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 64]: The sawdust floor was slightly impregnated with oil , and the open flame quivered in suggestive proximity to the side of the box ; however , some rather deep charrings of the plank against which the lantern hung offered evidence that the arrangement was by no means a new one , and indicated at least a possibility of no fatality occurring this time .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 65]: Next , Penrod turned up the surface of the sawdust in another corner of the floor , and drew forth a cigar-box in which were half a dozen cigarettes , made of hayseed and thick brown wrapping paper , a lead-pencil , an eraser , and a small note-book , the cover of which was labelled in his own handwriting : `` English Grammar .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 3]: Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: Room 6 , Ward School Nomber Seventh . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 56]: The first page of this book was purely academic ; but the study of English undefiled terminated with a slight jar at the top of the second : `` Nor must an adverb be used to modif -- '' Immediately followed : `` HARoLD RAMoREZ THE RoADAGENT OR WiLD LiFE AMoNG THE ROCKY MTS . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 21]: And the subsequent entries in the book appeared to have little concern with Room 6 , Ward School Nomber Seventh .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 90]: CHAPTER II ROMANCE The author of `` Harold Ramorez , '' etc. , lit one of the hayseed cigarettes , seated himself comfortably , with his back against the wall and his right shoulder just under the lantern , elevated his knees to support the note-book , turned to a blank page , and wrote , slowly and earnestly : `` CHAPITER THE SIXTH '' He took a knife from his pocket , and , broodingly , his eyes upon the inward embryos of vision , sharpened his pencil .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 20]: After that , he extended a foot and meditatively rubbed Duke 's back with the side of his shoe .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 22]: Creation , with Penrod , did not leap , full-armed , from the brain ; but finally he began to produce .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 50]: He wrote very slowly at first , and then with increasing rapidity ; faster and faster , gathering momentum and growing more and more fevered as he sped , till at last the true fire came , without which no lamp of real literature may be made to burn .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 30]: Mr. Wilson reched for his gun but our hero had him covred and soon said Well I guess you do n't come any of that on me my freind .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 21]: Well what makes you so sure about it sneered the other bitting his lip so savageley that the blood ran .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 33]: You are nothing but a common Roadagent any way and I do not propose to be bafled by such , Ramorez laughed at this and kep Mr. Wilson covred by his ottomatick .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 92]: Soon the two men were struggling together in the death-roes but soon Mr Wilson got him bound and gaged his mouth and went away for awhile leavin our hero , it was dark and he writhd at his bonds writhing on the floor wile the rats came out of their holes and bit him and vernim got all over him from the floor of that helish spot but soon he managed to push the gag out of his mouth with the end of his toungeu and got all his bonds off .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 67]: Soon Mr Wilson came back to tant him with his helpless condition flowed by his gang of detectives and they said Oh look at Ramorez sneering at his plight and tanted him with his helpless condition because Ramorez had put the bonds back sos he would look the same but could throw them off him when he wanted to Just look at him now sneered they .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 39]: To hear him talk you would thought he was hot stuff and they said Look at him now , him that was going to do so much , Oh I would not like to be in his fix .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 35]: Soon Harold got mad at this and jumped up with blasing eyes throwin off his bonds like they were air Ha Ha sneered he I guess you better not talk so much next time .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 65]: Soon there flowed another awful struggle and siezin his ottomatick back from Mr Wilson he shot two of the detectives through the heart Bing Bing went the ottomatick and two more went to meet their Maker only two detectives left now and so he stabbed one and the scondrel went to meet his Maker for now our hero was fighting for his very life .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 32]: It was dark in there now for night had falen and a terrible view met the eye Blood was just all over everything and the rats were eatin the dead men .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 43]: Soon our hero manged to get his back to the wall for he was fighting for his very life now and shot Mr Wilson through the abodmen Oh said Mr Wilson you -- -- -- -LRB- The dashes are Penrod 's . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 100]: Mr Wilson stagerd back vile oaths soilin his lips for he was in pain Why you -- -- you sneered he I will get you yet -- -- you Harold Ramorez The remainin scondrel had an ax which he came near our heros head with but missed him and ramand stuck in the wall Our heros amunition was exhaused what was he to do , the remanin scondrel would soon get his ax lose so our hero sprung forward and bit him till his teeth met in the flech for now our hero was fighting for his very life .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 12]: At this the remanin scondrel also cursed and swore vile oaths .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 101]: Oh sneered he -- -- -- you Harold Ramorez what did you bite me for Yes sneered Mr Wilson also and he has shot me in the abdomen too the -- Soon they were both cursin and reviln him together Why you -- -- -- -- -- sneered they what did you want to injure us for -- you Harold Ramorez you have not got any sence and you think you are so much but you are no better than anybody else and you are a -- -- -- -- -- -- Soon our hero could stand this no longer .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 97]: If you could learn to act like gentlmen said he I would not do any more to you now and your low vile exppresions have not got any effect on me only to injure your own self when you go to meet your Maker Oh I guess you have had enogh for one day and I think you have learned a lesson and will not soon atemp to beard Harold Ramorez again so with a tantig laugh he cooly lit a cigarrete and takin the keys of the cell from Mr Wilson poket went on out .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 218]: Soon Mr Wilson and the wonded detective manged to bind up their wonds and got up off the floor -- -- it I will have that dasstads life now sneered they if we have to swing for it -- -- -- -- him he shall not eccape us again the low down -- -- -- -- -- Chapiter seventh A mule train of heavily laden burros laden with gold from the mines was to be seen wondering among the highest clifts and gorgs of the Rocky Mts and a tall man with a long silken mustash and a cartigde belt could be heard cursin vile oaths because he well knew this was the lair of Harold Ramorez Why -- -- -- you you -- -- -- -- mules you sneered he because the poor mules were not able to go any quicker -- you I will show you Why -- -- -- -- -- -- it sneered he his oaths growing viler and viler I will whip you -- -- -- -- -- -- -- you sos you will not be able to walk for a week -- -- you you mean old -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- mules you Scarcly had the vile words left his lips when -- `` PENROD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 13]: It was his mother 's voice , calling from the back porch .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 40]: Simultaneously , the noon whistles began to blow , far and near ; and the romancer in the sawdust-box , summoned prosaically from steep mountain passes above the clouds , paused with stubby pencil halfway from lip to knee .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 14]: His eyes were shining : there was a rapt sweetness in his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 61]: As he wrote , his burden had grown lighter ; thoughts of Mrs. Lora Rewbush had almost left him ; and in particular as he recounted -LRB- even by the chaste dash -RRB- the annoyed expressions of Mr. Wilson , the wounded detective , and the silken moustached mule-driver , he had felt mysteriously relieved concerning the Child Sir Lancelot .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 10]: Altogether he looked a better and a brighter boy .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 4]: `` Pen-ROD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 6]: The rapt look faded slowly .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 7]: He sighed , but moved not .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 3]: `` Penrod !
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 24]: We 're having lunch early just on your account , so you 'll have plenty of time to be dressed for the pageant .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 3]: Hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 8]: There was silence in Penrod 's aerie .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 4]: `` PEN-rod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 11]: Mrs. Schofields voice sounded nearer , indicating a threatened approach .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 27]: Penrod bestirred himself : he blew out the lantern , and shouted plaintively : `` Well , ai n't I coming fast 's I can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 21]: `` Do hurry , '' returned the voice , withdrawing ; and the kitchen door could be heard to close .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 11]: Languidly , Penrod proceeded to set his house in order .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 51]: Replacing his manuscript and pencil in the cigar-box , he carefully buried the box in the sawdust , put the lantern and oil-can back in the soap-box , adjusted the elevator for the reception of Duke , and , in no uncertain tone , invited the devoted animal to enter .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 60]: Duke stretched himself amiably , affecting not to hear ; and when this pretence became so obvious that even a dog could keep it up no longer , sat down in a corner , facing it , his back to his master , and his head perpendicular , nose upward , supported by the convergence of the two walls .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 17]: This , from a dog , is the last word , the comble of the immutable .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 16]: Penrod commanded , stormed , tried gentleness ; persuaded with honeyed words and pictured rewards .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 11]: Duke 's eyes looked backward ; otherwise he moved not .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 3]: Time elapsed .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 18]: Penrod stooped to flattery , finally to insincere caresses ; then , losing patience spouted sudden threats .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 14]: Duke remained immovable , frozen fast to his great gesture of implacable despair .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 10]: A footstep sounded on the threshold of the store-room .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 12]: `` Penrod , come down from that box this instant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 10]: `` Are you up in that sawdust-box again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 37]: As Mrs. Schofield had just heard her son 's voice issue from the box , and also , as she knew he was there anyhow , her question must have been put for oratorical purposes only .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 58]: `` Because if you are , '' she continued promptly , `` I 'm going to ask your papa not to let you play there any -- '' Penrod 's forehead , his eyes , the tops of his ears , and most of his hair , became visible to her at the top of the box .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: `` I ai n't ` playing ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 4]: he said indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 9]: `` Well , what ARE you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 16]: `` Just coming down , '' he replied , in a grieved but patient tone .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 9]: `` Then why do n't you COME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 6]: `` I got Duke here .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 11]: I got to get him DOWN , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 20]: You do n't suppose I want to leave a poor dog in here to starve , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 12]: `` Well , hand him down over the side to me .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 17]: Let me -- '' `` I 'll get him down all right , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 17]: `` I got him up here , and I guess I can get him down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: `` Well then , DO it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 10]: `` I will if you 'll let me alone .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 19]: If you 'll go on back to the house I promise to be there inside of two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 3]: Honest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 15]: He put extreme urgency into this , and his mother turned toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 17]: `` If you 're not there in two minutes -- '' `` I will be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 52]: After her departure , Penrod expended some finalities of eloquence upon Duke , then disgustedly gathered him up in his arms , dumped him into the basket and , shouting sternly , `` All in for the ground floor -- step back there , madam -- all ready , Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 11]: lowered dog and basket to the floor of the storeroom .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 23]: Duke sprang out in tumultuous relief , and bestowed frantic affection upon his master as the latter slid down from the box .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 36]: Penrod dusted himself sketchily , experiencing a sense of satisfaction , dulled by the overhanging afternoon , perhaps , but perceptible : he had the feeling of one who has been true to a cause .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 49]: The operation of the elevator was unsinful and , save for the shock to Duke 's nervous system , it was harmless ; but Penrod could not possibly have brought himself to exhibit it in the presence of his mother or any other grown person in the world .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 16]: The reasons for secrecy were undefined ; at least , Penrod did not define them .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 25]: CHAPTER III THE COSTUME After lunch his mother and his sister Margaret , a pretty girl of nineteen , dressed him for the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 17]: They stood him near his mother 's bedroom window and did what they would to him .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 41]: During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute , exceeding the pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles ; but a student of eyes might have perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms of a sinister uprising .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 37]: At a rehearsal -LRB- in citizens ' clothes -RRB- attended by mothers and grown-up sisters , Mrs. Lora Rewbush had announced that she wished the costuming to be `` as medieval and artistic as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 26]: Otherwise , and as to details , she said , she would leave the costumes entirely to the good taste of the children 's parents .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 58]: Mrs. Schofield and Margaret were no archeologists , but they knew that their taste was as good as that of other mothers and sisters concerned ; so with perfect confidence they had planned and executed a costume for Penrod ; and the only misgiving they felt was connected with the tractability of the Child Sir Lancelot himself .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 35]: Stripped to his underwear , he had been made to wash himself vehemently ; then they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings , once blue but now mostly whitish .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 28]: Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed mere ampleness ; but they were long , and it required only a rather loose imagination to assume that they were tights .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 22]: The upper part of his body was next concealed from view by a garment so peculiar that its description becomes difficult .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 61]: In 1886 , Mrs. Schofield , then unmarried , had worn at her `` coming-out party '' a dress of vivid salmon silk which had been remodelled after her marriage to accord with various epochs of fashion until a final , unskilful campaign at a dye-house had left it in a condition certain to attract much attention to the wearer .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 38]: Mrs. Schofield had considered giving it to Della , the cook ; but had decided not to do so , because you never could tell how Della was going to take things , and cooks were scarce .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 72]: It may have been the word `` medieval '' -LRB- in Mrs. Lora Rewbush 's rich phrase -RRB- which had inspired the idea for a last conspicuous usefulness ; at all events , the bodice of that once salmon dress , somewhat modified and moderated , now took a position , for its farewell appearance in society , upon the back , breast , and arms of the Child Sir Lancelot .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 23]: The area thus costumed ceased at the waist , leaving a Jaeger-like and unmedieval gap thence to the tops of the stockings .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 23]: The inventive genius of woman triumphantly bridged it , but in a manner which imposes upon history almost insuperable delicacies of narration .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 93]: Penrod 's father was an old-fashioned man : the twentieth century had failed to shake his faith in red flannel for cold weather ; and it was while Mrs. Schofield was putting away her husband 's winter underwear that she perceived how hopelessly one of the elder specimens had dwindled ; and simultaneously she received the inspiration which resulted in a pair of trunks for the Child Sir Lancelot , and added an earnest bit of colour , as well as a genuine touch of the Middle Ages , to his costume .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 39]: Reversed , fore to aft , with the greater part of the legs cut off , and strips of silver braid covering the seams , this garment , she felt , was not traceable to its original source .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 27]: When it had been placed upon Penrod , the stockings were attached to it by a system of safety-pins , not very perceptible at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 32]: Next , after being severely warned against stooping , Penrod got his feet into the slippers he wore to dancing-school -- `` patent-leather pumps '' now decorated with large pink rosettes .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 37]: `` If I ca n't stoop , '' he began , smolderingly , `` I 'd like to know how 'm I goin ' to kneel in the pag -- '' `` You must MANAGE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 13]: This , uttered through pins , was evidently thought to be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 25]: They fastened some ruching about his slender neck , pinned ribbons at random all over him , and then Margaret thickly powdered his hair .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 23]: `` Oh , yes , that 's all right , '' she said , replying to a question put by her mother .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 11]: `` They always powdered their hair in Colonial times . ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 18]: `` It does n't seem right to me -- exactly , '' objected Mrs. Schofield , gently .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 14]: `` Sir Lancelot must have been ever so long before Colonial times . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 11]: `` That does n't matter , '' Margaret reassured her .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 14]: `` Nobody 'll know the difference -- Mrs. Lora Rewbush least of all .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 30]: I do n't think she knows a thing about it , though , of course , she does write splendidly and the words of the pageant are just beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 6]: Stand still , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 13]: -LRB- The author of `` Harold Ramorez '' had moved convulsively . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 9]: `` Besides , powdered hair 's always becoming .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 4]: Look at him .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 9]: You 'd hardly know it was Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 29]: The pride and admiration with which she pronounced this undeniable truth might have been thought tactless , but Penrod , not analytical , found his spirits somewhat elevated .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 33]: No mirror was in his range of vision and , though he had submitted to cursory measurements of his person a week earlier , he had no previous acquaintance with the costume .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 38]: He began to form a not unpleasing mental picture of his appearance , something somewhere between the portraits of George Washington and a vivid memory of Miss Julia Marlowe at a matinee of `` Twelfth Night . ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 22]: He was additionally cheered by a sword which had been borrowed from a neighbor , who was a Knight of Pythias .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 14]: Finally there was a mantle , an old golf cape of Margaret 's .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 36]: Fluffy polka-dots of white cotton had been sewed to it generously ; also it was ornamented with a large cross of red flannel , suggested by the picture of a Crusader in a newspaper advertisement .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 48]: The mantle was fastened to Penrod 's shoulder -LRB- that is , to the shoulder of Mrs. Schofield 's ex-bodice -RRB- by means of large safety-pins , and arranged to hang down behind him , touching his heels , but obscuring nowise the glory of his facade .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 14]: Then , at last , he was allowed to step before a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 12]: It was a full-length glass , and the worst immediately happened .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 34]: It might have been a little less violent , perhaps , if Penrod 's expectations had not been so richly and poetically idealized ; but as things were , the revolt was volcanic .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 59]: Victor Hugo 's account of the fight with the devil-fish , in `` Toilers of the Sea , '' encourages a belief that , had Hugo lived and increased in power , he might have been equal to a proper recital of the half hour which followed Penrod 's first sight of himself as the Child Sir Lancelot .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 74]: But Mr. Wilson himself , dastard but eloquent foe of Harold Ramorez , could not have expressed , with all the vile dashes at his command , the sentiments which animated Penrod 's bosom when the instantaneous and unalterable conviction descended upon him that he was intended by his loved ones to make a public spectacle of himself in his sister 's stockings and part of an old dress of his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 27]: To him these familiar things were not disguised at all ; there seemed no possibility that the whole world would not know them at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: The stockings were worse than the bodice .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 45]: He had been assured that these could not be recognized , but , seeing them in the mirror , he was sure that no human eye could fail at first glance to detect the difference between himself and the former purposes of these stockings .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 23]: Fold , wrinkle , and void shrieked their history with a hundred tongues , invoking earthquake , eclipse , and blue ruin .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 42]: The frantic youth 's final submission was obtained only after a painful telephonic conversation between himself and his father , the latter having been called up and upon , by the exhausted Mrs. Schofield , to subjugate his offspring by wire .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 49]: The two ladies made all possible haste , after this , to deliver Penrod into the hands of Mrs. Lora Rewbush ; nevertheless , they found opportunity to exchange earnest congratulations upon his not having recognized the humble but serviceable paternal garment now brilliant about the Lancelotish middle .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 11]: Altogether , they felt that the costume was a success .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 96]: Penrod looked like nothing ever remotely imagined by Sir Thomas Malory or Alfred Tennyson ; -- for that matter , he looked like nothing ever before seen on earth ; but as Mrs. Schofield and Margaret took their places in the audience at the Women 's Arts and Guild Hall , the anxiety they felt concerning Penrod 's elocutionary and gesticular powers , so soon to be put to public test , was pleasantly tempered by their satisfaction that , owing to their efforts , his outward appearance would be a credit to the family .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 31]: CHAPTER IV DESPERATION The Child Sir Lancelot found himself in a large anteroom behind the stage -- a room crowded with excited children , all about equally medieval and artistic .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 52]: Penrod was less conspicuous than he thought himself , but he was so preoccupied with his own shame , steeling his nerves to meet the first inevitable taunting reference to his sister 's stockings , that he failed to perceive there were others present in much of his own unmanned condition .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 43]: Retiring to a corner , immediately upon his entrance , he managed to unfasten the mantle at the shoulders , and , drawing it round him , pinned it again at his throat so that it concealed the rest of his costume .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 34]: This permitted a temporary relief , but increased his horror of the moment when , in pursuance of the action of the `` pageant , '' the sheltering garment must be cast aside .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 15]: Some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles close about them .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 47]: A few of the envied opulent swung brilliant fabrics from their shoulders , airily , showing off hired splendours from a professional costumer 's stock , while one or two were insulting examples of parental indulgence , particularly little Maurice Levy , the Child Sir Galahad .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 29]: This shrinking person went clamorously about , making it known everywhere that the best tailor in town had been dazzled by a great sum into constructing his costume .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 23]: It consisted of blue velvet knickerbockers , a white satin waistcoat , and a beautifully cut little swallow-tailed coat with pearl buttons .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 23]: The medieval and artistic triumph was completed by a mantle of yellow velvet , and little white boots , sporting gold tassels .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 25]: All this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed the Child Sir Lancelot , gathering an immediately formed semicircular audience of little girls .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 8]: Woman was ever the trailer of magnificence .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 7]: `` What YOU got on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 8]: inquired Mr. Levy , after dispensing information .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 12]: `` What you got on under that ole golf cape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 6]: Penrod looked upon him coldly .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 16]: At other times his questioner would have approached him with deference , even with apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 17]: But to-day the Child Sir Galahad was somewhat intoxicated with the power of his own beauty .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 7]: `` What YOU got on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 22]: `` Oh , nothin ' , '' said Penrod , with an indifference assumed at great cost to his nervous system .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: The elate Maurice was inspired to set up as a wit .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 7]: `` Then you 're nakid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 4]: he shouted exultantly .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 17]: `` Penrod Schofield says he has n't got nothin ' on under that ole golf cape !
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 4]: He 's nakid !
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 5]: He 's nakid . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 37]: The indelicate little girls giggled delightedly , and a javelin pierced the inwards of Penrod when he saw that the Child Elaine , amber-curled and beautiful Marjorie Jones , lifted golden laughter to the horrid jest .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 10]: Other boys and girls came flocking to the uproar .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 10]: `` He 's nakid , he 's nakid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 6]: shrieked the Child Sir Galahad .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 6]: `` Penrod Schofield 's nakid !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 5]: He 's NA-A-A-KID ! ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 6]: `` Hush , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 12]: said Mrs. Lora Rewbush , pushing her way into the group .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 12]: `` Remember , we are all little knights and ladies to-day .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 15]: Little knights and ladies of the Table Round would not make so much noise .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 14]: Now children , we must begin to take our places on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 5]: Is everybody here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 36]: Penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion : he slid behind Mrs. Lora Rewbush , and being near a door , opened it unnoticed and went out quickly , closing it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 21]: He found himself in a narrow and vacant hallway which led to a door marked `` Janitor 's Room . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 35]: Burning with outrage , heart-sick at the sweet , cold-blooded laughter of Marjorie Jones , Penrod rested his elbows upon a window-sill and speculated upon the effects of a leap from the second story .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 31]: One of the reasons he gave it up was his desire to live on Maurice Levy 's account : already he was forming educational plans for the Child Sir Galahad .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 15]: A stout man in blue overalls passed through the hallway muttering to himself petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 13]: `` I reckon they 'll find that hall hot enough NOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 24]: he said , conveying to Penrod an impression that some too feminine women had sent him upon an unreasonable errand to the furnace .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 31]: He went into the Janitor 's Room and , emerging a moment later , minus the overalls , passed Penrod again with a bass rumble -- `` Dern 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 21]: it seemed he said -- and made a gloomy exit by the door at the upper end of the hallway .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 28]: The conglomerate and delicate rustle of a large , mannerly audience was heard as the janitor opened and closed the door ; and stage-fright seized the boy .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 26]: The orchestra began an overture , and , at that , Penrod , trembling violently , tiptoed down the hall into the Janitor 's Room .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 17]: It was a cul-de-sac : There was no outlet save by the way he had come .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 35]: Despairingly he doffed his mantle and looked down upon himself for a last sickening assurance that the stockings were as obviously and disgracefully Margaret 's as they had seemed in the mirror at home .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 19]: For a moment he was encouraged : perhaps he was no worse than some of the other boys .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 19]: Then he noticed that a safety-pin had opened ; one of those connecting the stockings with his trunks .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 21]: He sat down to fasten it and his eye fell for the first time with particular attention upon the trunks .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 11]: Until this instant he had been preoccupied with the stockings .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 7]: Slowly recognition dawned in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 54]: The Schofields ' house stood on a corner at the intersection of two main-travelled streets ; the fence was low , and the publicity obtained by the washable portion of the family apparel , on Mondays , had often been painful to Penrod ; for boys have a peculiar sensitiveness in these matters .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 41]: A plain , matter-of-fact washerwoman ' employed by Mrs. Schofield , never left anything to the imagination of the passer-by ; and of all her calm display the scarlet flaunting of his father 's winter wear had most abashed Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 28]: One day Marjorie Jones , all gold and starch , had passed when the dreadful things were on the line : Penrod had hidden himself , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 15]: The whole town , he was convinced , knew these garments intimately and derisively .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 19]: And now , as he sat in the janitor 's chair , the horrible and paralyzing recognition came .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 33]: He had not an instant 's doubt that every fellow actor , as well as every soul in the audience , would recognize what his mother and sister had put upon him .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 42]: For as the awful truth became plain to himself it seemed blazoned to the world ; and far , far louder than the stockings , the trunks did fairly bellow the grisly secret : WHOSE they were and WHAT they were !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 57]: Most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding themselves very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of well-dressed people , and such dreamers ' sensations are comparable to Penrod 's , though faintly , because Penrod was awake and in much too full possession of the most active capacities for anguish .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 60]: A human male whose dress has been damaged , or reveals some vital lack , suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes every second absolutely unbearable until he is again as others of his sex and species ; and there is no act or sin whatever too desperate for him in his struggle to attain that condition .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 31]: Also , there is absolutely no embarrassment possible to a woman which is comparable to that of a man under corresponding circumstances and in this a boy is a man .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 29]: Gazing upon the ghastly trunks , the stricken Penrod felt that he was a degree worse then nude ; and a great horror of himself filled his soul .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 13]: The door into the hallway opened , and a voice demanded him .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 26]: He could not be seen from the hallway , but the hue and the cry was up ; and he knew he must be taken .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 8]: It was only a question of seconds .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 6]: He huddled in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Lora Rewbush angrily .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 20]: The distracted boy rose and , as he did so , a long pin sank deep into his back .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 26]: He extracted it frenziedly , which brought to his ears a protracted and sonorous ripping , too easily located by a final gesture of horror .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 10]: Mrs. Lora Rewbush had come out into the hallway .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 38]: And now , in this extremity , when all seemed lost indeed , particularly including honour , the dilating eye of the outlaw fell upon the blue overalls which the janitor had left hanging upon a peg .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 7]: Inspiration and action were almost simultaneous .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 12]: CHAPTER V THE PAGEANT OF THE TABLE ROUND `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 20]: Mrs. Lora Rewbush stood in the doorway , indignantly gazing upon a Child Sir Lancelot mantled to the heels .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 20]: `` Do you know that you have kept an audience of five hundred people waiting for ten minutes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 13]: She , also , detained the five hundred while she spake further .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 26]: `` Well , '' said Penrod contentedly , as he followed her toward the buzzing stage , `` I was just sitting there thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 28]: Two minutes later the curtain rose on a medieval castle hall richly done in the new stage-craft made in Germany and consisting of pink and blue cheesecloth .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 76]: The Child King Arthur and the Child Queen Guinevere were disclosed upon thrones , with the Child Elaine and many other celebrities in attendance ; while about fifteen Child Knights were seated at a dining-room table round , which was covered with a large Oriental rug , and displayed -LRB- for the knights ' refreshment -RRB- a banquet service of silver loving-cups and trophies , borrowed from the Country Club and some local automobile manufacturers .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 25]: In addition to this splendour , potted plants and palms have seldom been more lavishly used in any castle on the stage or off .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 27]: The footlights were aided by a `` spot-light '' from the rear of the hall ; and the children were revealed in a blaze of glory .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 17]: A hushed , multitudinous `` O-OH '' of admiration came from the decorous and delighted audience .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 19]: Then the children sang feebly : `` Chuldrun of the Tabul Round , Lit-tul knights and ladies we .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 12]: Let our voy-siz all resound Faith and hope and charitee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 47]: The Child King Arthur rose , extended his sceptre with the decisive gesture of a semaphore , and spake : `` Each littul knight and lady born Has noble deeds TO perform In THEE child-world of shivullree , No matter how small his share may be .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 16]: Let each advance and tell in turn What claim has each to knighthood earn . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 40]: The Child Sir Mordred , the villain of this piece , rose in his place at the table round , and piped the only lines ever written by Mrs. Lora Rewbush which Penrod Schofield could have pronounced without loathing .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 17]: Georgie Bassett , a really angelic boy , had been selected for the role of Mordred .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 22]: His perfect conduct had earned for him the sardonic sobriquet , `` The Little Gentleman , '' among his boy acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 8]: -LRB- Naturally he had no friends . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 20]: Hence the other boys supposed that he had been selected for the wicked Mordred as a reward of virtue .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 26]: He declaimed serenely : `` I hight Sir Mordred the Child , and I teach Lessons of selfishest evil , and reach Out into darkness .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 13]: Thoughtless , unkind , And ruthless is Mordred , and unrefined . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 26]: The Child Mordred was properly rebuked and denied the accolade , though , like the others , he seemed to have assumed the title already .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 7]: He made a plotter 's exit .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 31]: Whereupon Maurice Levy rose , bowed , announced that he highted the Child Sir Galahad , and continued with perfect sang-froid : `` I am the purest of the pure .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 8]: I have but kindest thoughts each day .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 17]: I give my riches to the poor , And follow in the Master 's way . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 36]: This elicited tokens of approval from the Child King Arthur , and he bade Maurice `` stand forth '' and come near the throne , a command obeyed with the easy grace of conscious merit .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 6]: It was Penrod 's turn .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 42]: He stepped back from his chair , the table between him and the audience , and began in a high , breathless monotone : `` I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake , the Child , Gentul-hearted , meek , and mild .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 32]: What though I 'm BUT a littul child , Gentul-heartud , meek , and mild , I do my share though but -- though but -- '' Penrod paused and gulped .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 19]: The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was heard from the wings , prompting irritably , and the Child .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 25]: Sir Lancelot repeated : `` I do my share though but -- though but a tot , I pray you knight Sir Lancelot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 19]: This also met the royal favour , and Penrod was bidden to join Sir Galahad at the throne .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 16]: As he crossed the stage , Mrs. Schofield whispered to Margaret : `` That boy !
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 14]: He 's unpinned his mantle and fixed it to cover his whole costume .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 11]: After we worked so hard to make it becoming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 20]: `` Never mind ; he 'll have to take the cape off in a minute , '' returned Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 12]: She leaned forward suddenly , narrowing her eyes to see better .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 12]: `` What IS that thing hanging about his left ankle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 4]: she whispered uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 4]: `` How queer !
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 9]: He must have got tangled in something . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 7]: asked Mrs. Schofield , in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 5]: `` His left foot .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 5]: It makes him stumble .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 12]: It looks -- it looks like an elephant 's foot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 16]: The Child Sir Lancelot and the Child Sir Galahad clasped hands before their Child King .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 36]: Penrod was conscious of a great uplift ; in a moment he would have to throw aside his mantle , but even so he was protected and sheltered in the human garment of a man .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 20]: His stage-fright had passed , for the audience was but an indistinguishable blur of darkness beyond the dazzling lights .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 41]: His most repulsive speech -LRB- that in which he proclaimed himself a `` tot '' -RRB- was over and done with ; and now at last the small , moist hand of the Child Sir Galahad lay within his own .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 13]: Craftily his brown fingers stole from Maurice 's palm to the wrist .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 21]: The two boys declaimed in concert : `` We are two chuldrun of the Tabul Round Strewing kindness all a-round .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 19]: With love and good deeds striving ever for the best , May our littul efforts e'er be blest .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 6]: Two littul hearts we offer .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 15]: See United in love , faith , hope , and char -- OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 8]: The conclusion of the duet was marred .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 26]: The Child Sir Galahad suddenly stiffened , and , uttering an irrepressible shriek of anguish , gave a brief exhibition of the contortionist 's art .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 9]: -LRB- `` HE 'S TWISTIN ' MY WRIST !
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 7]: DERN YOU , LEGGO ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 17]: The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was again heard from the wings ; it sounded bloodthirsty .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 62]: Penrod released his victim ; and the Child King Arthur , somewhat disconcerted , extended his sceptre and , with the assistance of the enraged prompter , said : `` Sweet child-friends of the Tabul Round , In brotherly love and kindness abound , Sir Lancelot , you have spoken well , Sir Galahad , too , as clear as bell .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 8]: So now pray doff your mantles gay .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: You shall be knighted this very day . ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 6]: And Penrod doffed his mantle .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 23]: Simultaneously , a thick and vasty gasp came from the audience , as from five hundred bathers in a wholly unexpected surf .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 27]: This gasp was punctuated irregularly , over the auditorium , by imperfectly subdued screams both of dismay and incredulous joy , and by two dismal shrieks .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 20]: Altogether it was an extraordinary sound , a sound never to be forgotten by any one who heard it .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 51]: It was almost as unforgettable as the sight which caused it ; the word `` sight '' being here used in its vernacular sense , for Penrod , standing unmantled and revealed in all the medieval and artistic glory of the janitor 's blue overalls , falls within its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 18]: The janitor was a heavy man , and his overalls , upon Penrod , were merely oceanic .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 39]: The boy was at once swaddled and lost within their blue gulfs and vast saggings ; and the left leg , too hastily rolled up , had descended with a distinctively elephantine effect , as Margaret had observed .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 12]: Certainly , the Child Sir Lancelot was at least a sight .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 30]: It is probable that a great many in that hall must have had , even then , a consciousness that they were looking on at History in the Making .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 15]: A supreme act is recognizable at sight : it bears the birthmark of immortality .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 59]: But Penrod , that marvellous boy , had begun to declaim , even with the gesture of flinging off his mantle for the accolade : `` I first , the Child Sir Lancelot du Lake , Will volunteer to knighthood take , And kneeling here before your throne I vow to -- '' He finished his speech unheard .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 27]: The audience had recovered breath , but had lost self-control , and there ensued something later described by a participant as a sort of cultured riot .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 21]: The actors in the `` pageant '' were not so dumfounded by Penrod 's costume as might have been expected .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 47]: A few precocious geniuses perceived that the overalls were the Child Lancelot 's own comment on maternal intentions ; and these were profoundly impressed : they regarded him with the grisly admiration of young and ambitious criminals for a jail-mate about to be distinguished by hanging .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 35]: But most of the children simply took it to be the case -LRB- a little strange , but not startling -RRB- that Penrod 's mother had dressed him like that -- which is pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 11]: They tried to go on with the `` pageant . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 8]: They made a brief , manful effort .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 38]: But the irrepressible outbursts from the audience bewildered them ; every time Sir Lancelot du Lake the Child opened his mouth , the great , shadowy house fell into an uproar , and the children into confusion .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 21]: Strong women and brave girls in the audience went out into the lobby , shrieking and clinging to one another .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 12]: Others remained , rocking in their seats , helpless and spent .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 14]: The neighbourhood of Mrs. Schofield and Margaret became , tactfully , a desert .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 35]: Friends of the author went behind the scenes and encountered a hitherto unknown phase of Mrs. Lora Rewbush ; they said , afterward , that she hardly seemed to know what she was doing .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 17]: She begged to be left alone somewhere with Penrod Schofield , for just a little while .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 5]: They led her away .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 47]: CHAPTER VI EVENING The sun was setting behind the back fence -LRB- though at a considerable distance -RRB- as Penrod Schofield approached that fence and looked thoughtfully up at the top of it , apparently having in mind some purpose to climb up and sit there .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 29]: Debating this , he passed his fingers gently up and down the backs of his legs ; and then something seemed to decide him not to sit anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 18]: He leaned against the fence , sighed profoundly , and gazed at Duke , his wistful dog .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 16]: The sigh was reminiscent : episodes of simple pathos were passing before his inward eye .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 53]: About the most painful was the vision of lovely Marjorie Jones , weeping with rage as the Child Sir Lancelot was dragged , insatiate , from the prostrate and howling Child Sir Galahad , after an onslaught delivered the precise instant the curtain began to fall upon the demoralized `` pageant . ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 7]: And then -- oh , pangs !
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 4]: oh , woman !
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 34]: -- she slapped at the ruffian 's cheek , as he was led past her by a resentful janitor ; and turning , flung her arms round the Child Sir Galahad 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 20]: `` PENROD SCHOFIELD , DO N'T YOU DARE EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU LIVE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 13]: Maurice 's little white boots and gold tassels had done their work .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 20]: At home the late Child Sir Lancelot was consigned to a locked clothes-closet pending the arrival of his father .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 18]: Mr. Schofield came and , shortly after , there was put into practice an old patriarchal custom .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 30]: It is a custom of inconceivable antiquity : probably primordial , certainly prehistoric , but still in vogue in some remaining citadels of the ancient simplicities of the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 17]: And now , therefore , in the dusk , Penrod leaned against the fence and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 17]: His case is comparable to that of an adult who could have survived a similar experience .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 26]: Looking back to the sawdust-box , fancy pictures this comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged in congenial literary activities in a private retreat .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 28]: We see this period marked by the creation of some of the most virile passages of a Work dealing exclusively in red corpuscles and huge primal impulses .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 53]: We see this thoughtful man dragged from his calm seclusion to a horrifying publicity ; forced to adopt the stage and , himself a writer , compelled to exploit the repulsive sentiments of an author not only personally distasteful to him but whose whole method and school in belles lettres he despises .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 15]: We see him reduced by desperation and modesty to stealing a pair of overalls .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 51]: We conceive him to have ruined , then , his own reputation , and to have utterly disgraced his family ; next , to have engaged in the duello and to have been spurned by his lady-love , thus lost to him -LRB- according to her own declaration -RRB- forever .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 17]: Finally , we must behold : imprisonment by the authorities ; the third degree and flagellation .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 14]: We conceive our man decided that his career had been perhaps too eventful .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 11]: Yet Penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 50]: It appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a recent fulness of life , for , as he leaned against the fence , gazing upon his wistful Duke , he sighed again and murmured aloud : `` WELL , HAS N'T THIS BEEN A DAY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 35]: But in a little while a star came out , freshly lighted , from the highest part of the sky , and Penrod , looking up , noticed it casually and a little drowsily .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 3]: He yawned .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 19]: Then he sighed once more , but not reminiscently : evening had come ; the day was over .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 8]: It was a sigh of pure ennui .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 30]: CHAPTER VII EVILS OF DRINK Next day , Penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique process which was without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of Babylon .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 49]: When the teacher of his class in Sunday-school requested the weekly contribution , Penrod , fumbling honestly -LRB- at first -RRB- in the wrong pockets , managed to look so embarrassed that the gentle lady told him not to mind , and said she was often forgetful herself .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 25]: She was so sweet about it that , looking into the future , Penrod began to feel confident of a small but regular income .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 33]: At the close of the afternoon services he did not go home , but proceeded to squander the funds just withheld from China upon an orgy of the most pungently forbidden description .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 59]: In a Drug Emporium , near the church , he purchased a five-cent sack of candy consisting for the most part of the heavily flavoured hoofs of horned cattle , but undeniably substantial , and so generously capable of resisting solution that the purchaser must needs be avaricious beyond reason who did not realize his money 's worth .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 29]: Equipped with this collation , Penrod contributed his remaining nickel to a picture show , countenanced upon the seventh day by the legal but not the moral authorities .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 34]: Here , in cozy darkness , he placidly insulted his liver with jaw-breaker upon jaw-breaker from the paper sack , and in a surfeit of content watched the silent actors on the screen .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 9]: One film made a lasting impression upon him .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 82]: It depicted with relentless pathos the drunkard 's progress ; beginning with his conversion to beer in the company of loose travelling men ; pursuing him through an inexplicable lapse into evening clothes and the society of some remarkably painful ladies , next , exhibiting the effects of alcohol on the victim 's domestic disposition , the unfortunate man was seen in the act of striking his wife and , subsequently , his pleading baby daughter with an abnormally heavy walking-stick .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 32]: Their flight -- through the snow -- to seek the protection of a relative was shown , and finally , the drunkard 's picturesque behaviour at the portals of a madhouse .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 45]: So fascinated was Penrod that he postponed his departure until this film came round again , by which time he had finished his unnatural repast and almost , but not quite , decided against following the profession of a drunkard when he grew up .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 26]: Emerging , satiated , from the theatre , a public timepiece before a jeweller 's shop confronted him with an unexpected dial and imminent perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 12]: How was he to explain at home these hours of dalliance ?
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 39]: There was a steadfast rule that he return direct from Sunday-school ; and Sunday rules were important , because on that day there was his father , always at home and at hand , perilously ready for action .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 31]: One of the hardest conditions of boyhood is the almost continuous strain put upon the powers of invention by the constant and harassing necessity for explanations of every natural act .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 53]: Proceeding homeward through the deepening twilight as rapidly as possible , at a gait half skip and half canter , Penrod made up his mind in what manner he would account for his long delay , and , as he drew nearer , rehearsed in words the opening passage of his defence .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 31]: `` Now see here , '' he determined to begin ; `` I do not wished to be blamed for things I could n't help , nor any other boy .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 47]: I was going along the street by a cottage and a lady put her head out of the window and said her husband was drunk and whipping her and her little girl , and she asked me would n't I come in and help hold him .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 85]: So I went in and tried to get hold of this drunken lady 's husband where he was whipping their baby daughter , but he would n't pay any attention , and I TOLD her I ought to be getting home , but she kep ' on askin ' me to stay -- '' At this point he reached the corner of his own yard , where a coincidence not only checked the rehearsal of his eloquence but happily obviated all occasion for it .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 29]: A cab from the station drew up in front of the gate , and there descended a troubled lady in black and a fragile little girl about three .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 13]: Mrs. Schofield rushed from the house and enfolded both in hospitable arms .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 33]: They were Penrod 's Aunt Clara and cousin , also Clara , from Dayton , Illinois , and in the flurry of their arrival everybody forgot to put Penrod to the question .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 36]: It is doubtful , however , if he felt any relief ; there may have been even a slight , unconscious disappointment not altogether dissimilar to that of an actor deprived of a good part .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 32]: In the course of some really necessary preparations for dinner he stepped from the bathroom into the pink-and-white bedchamber of his sister , and addressed her rather thickly through a towel .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 15]: `` When 'd mamma find out Aunt Clara and Cousin Clara were coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 10]: `` Not till she saw them from the window .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 11]: She just happened to look out as they drove up .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 13]: Aunt Clara telegraphed this morning , but it was n't delivered . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 10]: `` How long they goin ' to stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 18]: Penrod ceased to rub his shining face , and thoughtfully tossed the towel through the bathroom door .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 20]: `` Uncle John wo n't try to make 'em come back home , I guess , will he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 30]: -LRB- Uncle John was Aunt Clara 's husband , a successful manufacturer of stoves , and his lifelong regret was that he had not entered the Baptist ministry . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 14]: `` He 'll let 'em stay here quietly , wo n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: `` What ARE you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 8]: demanded Margaret , turning from her mirror .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: `` Uncle John sent them here .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 9]: Why should n't he let them stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 4]: Penrod looked crestfallen .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 10]: `` Then he has n't taken to drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 5]: `` Certainly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 12]: She emphasized the denial with a pretty peal of soprano laughter .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 24]: `` Then why , '' asked her brother gloomily , `` why did Aunt Clara look so worried when she got here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 11]: Do n't people worry about anything except somebody 's drinking ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 9]: Where did you get such an idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he persisted , `` you do n't KNOW it ai n't that . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 6]: She laughed again , wholeheartedly .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 5]: `` Poor Uncle John !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 14]: He wo n't even allow grape juice or ginger ale in his house .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 13]: They came because they were afraid little Clara might catch the measles .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 26]: She 's very delicate , and there 's such an epidemic of measles among the children over in Dayton the schools had to be closed .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 40]: Uncle John got so worried that last night he dreamed about it ; and this morning he could n't stand it any longer and packed them off over here , though he thinks its wicked to travel on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 27]: And Aunt Clara was worried when she got here because they 'd forgotten to check her trunk and it will have to be sent by express .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 28]: Now what in the name of the common sense put it into your head that Uncle John had taken to -- '' `` Oh , nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 16]: He turned lifelessly away and went downstairs , a new-born hope dying in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: Life seems so needlessly dull sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 23]: CHAPTER VIII SCHOOL Next morning , when he had once more resumed the dreadful burden of education , it seemed infinitely duller .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 24]: And yet what pleasanter sight is there than a schoolroom well filled with children of those sprouting years just before the ` teens ?
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 30]: The casual visitor , gazing from the teacher 's platform upon these busy little heads , needs only a blunted memory to experience the most agreeable and exhilarating sensations .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 37]: Still , for the greater part , the children are unconscious of the happiness of their condition ; for nothing is more pathetically true than that we `` never know when we are well off . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 38]: The boys in a public school are less aware of their happy state than are the girls ; and of all the boys in his room , probably Penrod himself had the least appreciation of his felicity .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 23]: He sat staring at an open page of a textbook , but not studying ; not even reading ; not even thinking .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 50]: Nor was he lost in a reverie : his mind 's eye was shut , as his physical eye might well have been , for the optic nerve , flaccid with ennui , conveyed nothing whatever of the printed page upon which the orb of vision was partially focused .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 36]: Penrod was doing something very unusual and rare , something almost never accomplished except by coloured people or by a boy in school on a spring day : he was doing really nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 8]: He was merely a state of being .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 40]: From the street a sound stole in through the open window , and abhorring Nature began to fill the vacuum called Penrod Schofield ; for the sound was the spring song of a mouth-organ , coming down the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 76]: The windows were intentionally above the level of the eyes of the seated pupils ; but the picture of the musician was plain to Penrod , painted for him by a quality in the runs and trills , partaking of the oboe , of the calliope , and of cats in anguish ; an excruciating sweetness obtained only by the wallowing , walloping yellow-pink palm of a hand whose back was Congo black and shiny .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 30]: The music came down the street and passed beneath the window , accompanied by the care-free shuffling of a pair of old shoes scuffing syncopations on the cement sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 14]: It passed into the distance ; became faint and blurred ; was gone .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 22]: Emotion stirred in Penrod a great and poignant desire , but -LRB- perhaps fortunately -RRB- no fairy godmother made her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 37]: Otherwise Penrod would have gone down the street in a black skin , playing the mouth-organ , and an unprepared coloured youth would have found himself enjoying educational advantages for which he had no ambition whatever .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 58]: Roused from perfect apathy , the boy cast about the schoolroom an eye wearied to nausea by the perpetual vision of the neat teacher upon the platform , the backs of the heads of the pupils in front of him , and the monotonous stretches of blackboard threateningly defaced by arithmetical formulae and other insignia of torture .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 29]: Above the blackboard , the walls of the high room were of white plaster -- white with the qualified whiteness of old snow in a soft coal town .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 17]: This dismal expanse was broken by four lithographic portraits , votive offerings of a thoughtful publisher .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 17]: The portraits were of good and great men , kind men ; men who loved children .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 7]: Their faces were noble and benevolent .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 21]: But the lithographs offered the only rest for the eyes of children fatigued by the everlasting sameness of the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 33]: Long day after long day , interminable week in and interminable week out , vast month on vast month , the pupils sat with those four portraits beaming kindness down upon them .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 29]: The faces became permanent in the consciousness of the children ; they became an obsession -- in and out of school the children were never free of them .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 49]: The four faces haunted the minds of children falling asleep ; they hung upon the minds of children waking at night ; they rose forebodingly in the minds of children waking in the morning ; they became monstrously alive in the minds of children lying sick of fever .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 39]: Never , while the children of that schoolroom lived , would they be able to forget one detail of the four lithographs : the hand of Longfellow was fixed , for them , forever , in his beard .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 59]: And by a simple and unconscious association of ideas , Penrod Schofield was accumulating an antipathy for the gentle Longfellow and for James Russell Lowell and for Oliver Wendell Holmes and for John Greenleaf Whittier , which would never permit him to peruse a work of one of those great New Englanders without a feeling of personal resentment .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 34]: His eyes fell slowly and inimically from the brow of Whittier to the braid of reddish hair belonging to Victorine Riordan , the little octoroon girl who sat directly in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 16]: Victorine 's back was as familiar to Penrod as the necktie of Oliver Wendell Holmes .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 8]: So was her gayly coloured plaid waist .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 14]: He hated the waist as he hated Victorine herself , without knowing why .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 25]: Enforced companionship in large quantities and on an equal basis between the sexes appears to sterilize the affections , and schoolroom romances are few .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 23]: Victorine 's hair was thick , and the brickish glints in it were beautiful , but Penrod was very tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 46]: A tiny knot of green ribbon finished off the braid and kept it from unravelling ; and beneath the ribbon there was a final wisp of hair which was just long enough to repose upon Penrod 's desk when Victorine leaned back in her seat .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 5]: It was there now .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 33]: Thoughtfully , he took the braid between thumb and forefinger , and , without disturbing Victorine , dipped the end of it and the green ribbon into the inkwell of his desk .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 43]: He brought hair and ribbon forth dripping purple ink , and partially dried them on a blotter , though , a moment later when Victorine leaned forward , they were still able to add a few picturesque touches to the plaid waist .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 18]: Rudolph Krauss , across the aisle from Penrod , watched the operation with protuberant eyes , fascinated .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 40]: Inspired to imitation , he took a piece of chalk from his pocket and wrote `` RATS '' across the shoulder-blades of the boy in front of him , then looked across appealingly to Penrod for tokens of congratulation .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 3]: Penrod yawned .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 17]: It may not be denied that at times he appeared to be a very self-centred boy .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 36]: CHAPTER IX SOARING Half the members of the class passed out to a recitation-room , the empurpled Victorine among them , and Miss Spence started the remaining half through the ordeal of trial by mathematics .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 47]: Several boys and girls were sent to the blackboard , and Penrod , spared for the moment , followed their operations a little while with his eyes , but not with his mind ; then , sinking deeper in his seat , limply abandoned the effort .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 40]: His eyes remained open , but saw nothing ; the routine of the arithmetic lesson reached his ears in familiar , meaningless sounds , but he heard nothing ; and yet , this time , he was profoundly occupied .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 26]: He had drifted away from the painful land of facts , and floated now in a new sea of fancy which he had just discovered .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 35]: Maturity forgets the marvellous realness of a boy 's day-dreams , how colourful they glow , rosy and living , and how opaque the curtain closing down between the dreamer and the actual world .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 18]: That curtain is almost sound-proof , too , and causes more throat-trouble among parents than is suspected .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 59]: The nervous monotony of the schoolroom inspires a sometimes unbearable longing for something astonishing to happen , and as every boy 's fundamental desire is to do something astonishing himself , so as to be the centre of all human interest and awe , it was natural that Penrod should discover in fancy the delightful secret of self-levitation .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 41]: He found , in this curious series of imaginings , during the lesson in arithmetic , that the atmosphere may be navigated as by a swimmer under water , but with infinitely greater ease and with perfect comfort in breathing .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 82]: In his mind he extended his arms gracefully , at a level with his shoulders , and delicately paddled the air with his hands , which at once caused him to be drawn up out of his seat and elevated gently to a position about midway between the floor and the ceiling , where he came to an equilibrium and floated ; a sensation not the less exquisite because of the screams of his fellow pupils , appalled by the miracle .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 56]: Miss Spence herself was amazed and frightened , but he only smiled down carelessly upon her when she commanded him to return to earth ; and then , when she climbed upon a desk to pull him down , he quietly paddled himself a little higher , leaving his toes just out of her reach .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 68]: Next , he swam through a few slow somersaults to show his mastery of the new art , and , with the shouting of the dumfounded scholars ringing in his ears , turned on his side and floated swiftly out of the window , immediately rising above the housetops , while people in the street below him shrieked , and a trolley car stopped dead in wonder .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 38]: With almost no exertion he paddled himself , many yards at a stroke , to the girls ' private school where Marjorie Jones was a pupil -- Marjorie Jones of the amber curls and the golden voice !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 27]: Long before the `` Pageant of the Table Round , '' she had offered Penrod a hundred proofs that she considered him wholly undesirable and ineligible .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 30]: At the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class she consistently incited and led the laughter at him whenever Professor Bartet singled him out for admonition in matters of feet and decorum .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 26]: And but yesterday she had chid him for his slavish lack of memory in daring to offer her a greeting on the way to Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 15]: I expect you must forgot I told you never to speak to me again !
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 34]: If I was a boy , I 'd be too proud to come hanging around people that do n't speak to me , even if I WAS the Worst Boy in Town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 5]: So she flouted him .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 56]: But now , as he floated in through the window of her classroom and swam gently along the ceiling like an escaped toy balloon , she fell upon her knees beside her little desk , and , lifting up her arms toward him , cried with love and admiration : `` Oh , PENrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 41]: He negligently kicked a globe from the high chandelier , and , smiling coldly , floated out through the hall to the front steps of the school , while Marjorie followed , imploring him to grant her one kind look .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 35]: In the street an enormous crowd had gathered , headed by Miss Spence and a brass band ; and a cheer from a hundred thousand throats shook the very ground as Penrod swam overhead .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 28]: Marjorie knelt upon the steps and watched adoringly while Penrod took the drum-major 's baton and , performing sinuous evolutions above the crowd , led the band .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 122]: Then he threw the baton so high that it disappeared from sight ; but he went swiftly after it , a double delight , for he had not only the delicious sensation of rocketing safely up and up into the blue sky , but also that of standing in the crowd below , watching and admiring himself as he dwindled to a speck , disappeared and then , emerging from a cloud , came speeding down , with the baton in his hand , to the level of the treetops , where he beat time for the band and the vast throng and Marjorie Jones , who all united in the `` Star-spangled Banner '' in honour of his aerial achievements .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 6]: It was a great moment .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 13]: It was a great moment , but something seemed to threaten it .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 17]: The face of Miss Spence looking up from the crowd grew too vivid -- unpleasantly vivid .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 14]: She was beckoning him and shouting , `` Come down , Penrod Schofield !
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 8]: Penrod Schofield , come down here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 21]: He could hear her above the band and the singing of the multitude ; she seemed intent on spoiling everything .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 42]: Marjorie Jones was weeping to show how sorry she was that she had formerly slighted him , and throwing kisses to prove that she loved him ; but Miss Spence kept jumping between him and Marjorie , incessantly calling his name .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 62]: He grew more and more irritated with her ; he was the most important person in the world and was engaged in proving it to Marjorie Jones and the whole city , and yet Miss Spence seemed to feel she still had the right to order him about as she did in the old days when he was an ordinary schoolboy .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 15]: He was furious ; he was sure she wanted him to do something disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 13]: It seemed to him that she had screamed `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 4]: thousands of times .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 71]: From the beginning of his aerial experiments in his own schoolroom , he had not opened his lips , knowing somehow that one of the requirements for air floating is perfect silence on the part of the floater ; but , finally , irritated beyond measure by Miss Spence 's clamorous insistence , he was unable to restrain an indignant rebuke and immediately came to earth with a frightful bump .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 62]: Miss Spence -- in the flesh -- had directed toward the physical body of the absent Penrod an inquiry as to the fractional consequences of dividing seventeen apples , fairly , among three boys , and she was surprised and displeased to receive no answer although to the best of her knowledge and belief , he was looking fixedly at her .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 19]: She repeated her question crisply , without visible effect ; then summoned him by name with increasing asperity .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 18]: Twice she called him , while all his fellow pupils turned to stare at the gazing boy .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 8]: She advanced a step from the platform .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 7]: `` Oh , my goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 4]: he shouted suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 10]: `` Ca n't you keep still a MINUTE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 8]: CHAPTER X UNCLE JOHN Miss Spence gasped .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 5]: So did the pupils .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 12]: The whole room filled with a swelling conglomerate `` O-O-O-O-H ! ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 12]: As for Penrod himself , the walls reeled with the shock .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 13]: He sat with his mouth open , a mere lump of stupefaction .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 24]: For the appalling words that he had hurled at the teacher were as inexplicable to him as to any other who heard them .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 18]: Nothing is more treacherous than the human mind ; nothing else so loves to play the Iscariot .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 22]: Even when patiently bullied into a semblance of order and training , it may prove but a base and shifty servant .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 31]: And Penrod 's mind was not his servant ; it was a master , with the April wind 's whims ; and it had just played him a diabolical trick .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 39]: The very jolt with which he came back to the schoolroom in the midst of his fancied flight jarred his day-dream utterly out of him ; and he sat , open-mouthed in horror at what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 8]: The unanimous gasp of awe was protracted .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 22]: Miss Spence , however , finally recovered her breath , and , returning deliberately to the platform , faced the school .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 22]: `` And then for a little while , '' as pathetic stories sometimes recount , `` everything was very still . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 19]: It was so still , in fact , that Penrod 's newborn notoriety could almost be heard growing .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 11]: This grisly silence was at last broken by the teacher .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 8]: `` Penrod Schofield , stand up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 5]: The miserable child obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 14]: `` What did you mean by speaking to me in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 40]: He hung his head , raked the floor with the side of his shoe , swayed , swallowed , looked suddenly at his hands with the air of never having seen them before , then clasped them behind him .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 38]: The school shivered in ecstatic horror , every fascinated eye upon him ; yet there was not a soul in the room but was profoundly grateful to him for the sensation -- including the offended teacher herself .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 21]: Unhappily , all this gratitude was unconscious and altogether different from the kind which , results in testimonials and loving-cups .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 4]: On the contrary !
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 3]: He gulped .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: `` Answer me at once !
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 10]: Why did you speak to me like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 12]: `` I was -- '' He choked , unable to continue .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 5]: `` Speak out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 13]: `` I was just -- thinking , '' he managed to stammer .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 11]: `` That will not do , '' she returned sharply .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 14]: `` I wish to know immediately why you spoke as you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 14]: The stricken Penrod answered helplessly : `` Because I was just thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 13]: Upon the very rack he could have offered no ampler truthful explanation .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 8]: It was all he knew about it .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 5]: `` Thinking what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 5]: `` Just thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 17]: Miss Spence 's expression gave evidence that her power of self-restraint was undergoing a remarkable test .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 16]: However , after taking counsel with herself , she commanded : `` Come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 16]: He shuffled forward , and she placed a chair upon the platform near her own .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: `` Sit there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 20]: Then -LRB- but not at all as if nothing had happened -RRB- , she continued the lesson in arithmetic .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 29]: Spiritually the children may have learned a lesson in very small fractions indeed as they gazed at the fragment of sin before them on the stool of penitence .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 23]: They all stared at him attentively with hard and passionately interested eyes , in which there was never one trace of pity .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 70]: It can not be said with precision that he writhed ; his movement was more a slow , continuous squirm , effected with a ghastly assumption of languid indifference ; while his gaze , in the effort to escape the marble-hearted glare of his schoolmates , affixed itself with apparent permanence to the waistcoat button of James Russell Lowell just above the `` U '' in `` Russell . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 11]: Classes came and classes went , grilling him with eyes .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 27]: Newcomers received the story of the crime in darkling whispers ; and the outcast sat and sat and sat , and squirmed and squirmed and squirmed .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 22]: -LRB- He did one or two things with his spine which a professional contortionist would have observed with real interest . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 16]: And all this while of freezing suspense was but the criminal 's detention awaiting trial .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 37]: A known punishment may be anticipated with some measure of equanimity ; at least , the prisoner may prepare himself to undergo it ; but the unknown looms more monstrous for every attempt to guess it .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 24]: Penrod 's crime was unique ; there were no rules to aid him in estimating the vengeance to fall upon him for it .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 50]: What seemed most probable was that he would be expelled from the schools in the presence of his family , the mayor , and council , and afterward whipped by his father upon the State House steps , with the entire city as audience by invitation of the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 3]: Noon came .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: The rows of children filed out , every head turning for a last unpleasingly speculative look at the outlaw .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 27]: Then Miss Spence closed the door into the cloakroom and that into the big hall , and came and sat at her desk , near Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 29]: The tramping of feet outside , the shrill calls and shouting and the changing voices of the older boys ceased to be heard -- and there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 20]: Penrod , still affecting to be occupied with Lowell , was conscious that Miss Spence looked at him intently .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 25]: `` Penrod , '' she said gravely , `` what excuse have you to offer before I report your case to the principal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 11]: The word `` principal '' struck him to the vitals .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 19]: Grand Inquisitor , Grand Khan , Sultan , Emperor , Tsar , Caesar Augustus -- these are comparable .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 9]: He stopped squirming instantly , and sat rigid .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 6]: `` I want an answer .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 10]: Why did you shout those words at me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 15]: `` Well , '' he murmured , `` I was just -- thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 5]: `` Thinking what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 4]: she asked sharply .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 7]: `` That wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 14]: He took his left ankle in his right hand and regarded it helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 14]: `` That wo n't do , Penrod Schofield , '' she repeated severely .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 20]: `` If that is all the excuse you have to offer I shall report your case this instant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 7]: And she rose with fatal intent .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: But Penrod was one of those whom the precipice inspires .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 10]: `` Well , I HAVE got an excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 14]: `` Well '' -- she paused impatiently -- `` what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 47]: He had not an idea , but he felt one coming , and replied automatically , in a plaintive tone : `` I guess anybody that had been through what I had to go through , last night , would think they had an excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 19]: Miss Spence resumed her seat , though with the air of being ready to leap from it instantly .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 16]: `` What has last night to do with your insolence to me this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 27]: `` Well , I guess you 'd see , '' he returned , emphasizing the plaintive note , `` if you knew what I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 59]: `` Now , Penrod , '' she said , in a kinder voice , `` I have a high regard for your mother and father , and it would hurt me to distress them , but you must either tell me what was the matter with you or I 'll have to take you to Mrs. Houston . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 10]: `` Well , ai n't I going to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 9]: he cried , spurred by the dread name .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 12]: `` It 's because I did n't sleep last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 6]: `` Were you ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 8]: The question was put with some dryness .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 5]: He felt the dryness .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 11]: `` No 'm ; _ I _ was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 33]: `` Then if someone in your family was so ill that even you were kept up all night , how does it happen they let you come to school this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 15]: `` It was n't illness , '' he returned , shaking his head mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: `` It was lots worse 'n anybody 's being sick .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 14]: It was -- it was -- well , it was jest awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 5]: `` WHAT was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 10]: He remarked with anxiety the incredulity in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 11]: `` It was about Aunt Clara , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 6]: `` Your Aunt Clara ! ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 18]: `` Do you mean your mother 's sister who married Mr. Farry of Dayton , Illinois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 11]: `` Yes -- Uncle John , '' returned Penrod sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 8]: `` The trouble was about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 15]: Miss Spence frowned a frown which he rightly interpreted as one of continued suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 13]: `` She and I were in school together , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 21]: `` I used to know her very well , and I 've always heard her married life was entirely happy .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 34]: I do n't -- '' `` Yes , it was , '' he interrupted , `` until last year when Uncle John took to running with travelling men -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 4]: He nodded solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 7]: `` That was what started it .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 50]: At first he was a good , kind husband , but these travelling men would coax him into a saloon on his way home from work , and they got him to drinking beer and then ales , wines , liquors , and cigars -- '' `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 58]: `` I 'm not inquiring into your Aunt Clara 's private affairs ; I 'm asking you if you have anything to say which would palliate -- '' `` That 's what I 'm tryin ' to TELL you about , Miss Spence , '' he pleaded , -- `` if you 'd jest only let me .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 27]: When Aunt Clara and her little baby daughter got to our house last night -- '' `` You say Mrs. Farry is visiting your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 16]: `` Yes 'm -- not just visiting -- you see , she HAD to come .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 43]: Well of course , little baby Clara , she was so bruised up and mauled , where he 'd been hittin ' her with his cane -- '' `` You mean that your uncle had done such a thing as THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 10]: exclaimed Miss Spence , suddenly disarmed by this scandal .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 59]: `` Yes 'm , and mamma and Margaret had to sit up all night nursin ' little Clara -- and AUNT Clara was in such a state SOMEBODY had to keep talkin ' to HER , and there was n't anybody but me to do it , so I -- '' `` But where was your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 14]: `` Where was your father while -- '' `` Oh -- papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 8]: Penrod paused , reflected ; then brightened .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 36]: `` Why , he was down at the train , waitin ' to see if Uncle John would try to follow 'em and make 'em come home so 's he could persecute 'em some more .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 33]: I wanted to do that , but they said if he did come I might n't be strong enough to hold him and -- '' The brave lad paused again , modestly .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 7]: Miss Spence 's expression was encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 25]: Her eyes were wide with astonishment , and there may have been in them , also , the mingled beginnings of admiration and self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 12]: Penrod , warming to his work , felt safer every moment .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 18]: `` And so , '' he continued , `` I had to sit up with Aunt Clara .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 27]: She had some pretty big bruises , too , and I had to -- '' `` But why did n't they send for a doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 12]: However , this question was only a flicker of dying incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 17]: `` Oh , they did n't want any DOCTOR , '' exclaimed the inspired realist promptly .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 39]: `` They do n't want anybody to HEAR about it because Uncle John might reform -- and then where 'd he be if everybody knew he 'd been a drunkard and whipped his wife and baby daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 4]: said Miss Spence .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 18]: `` You see , he used to be upright as anybody , '' he went on explanatively .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 12]: `` It all begun -- '' `` Began , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 19]: It all commenced from the first day he let those travelling men coax him into the saloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 11]: Penrod narrated the downfall of his Uncle John at length .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 67]: In detail he was nothing short of plethoric ; and incident followed incident , sketched with such vividness , such abundance of colour , and such verisimilitude to a drunkard 's life as a drunkard 's life should be , that had Miss Spence possessed the rather chilling attributes of William J. Burns himself , the last trace of skepticism must have vanished from her mind .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 27]: Besides , there are two things that will be believed of any man whatsoever , and one of them is that he has taken to drink .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 25]: And in every sense it was a moving picture which , with simple but eloquent words , the virtuous Penrod set before his teacher .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 25]: His eloquence increased with what it fed on ; and as with the eloquence so with self-reproach in the gentle bosom of the teacher .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 21]: She cleared her throat with difficulty once or twice , during his description of his ministering night with Aunt Clara .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 26]: `` And I said to her , ` Why , Aunt Clara , what 's the use of takin ' on so about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 24]: And I said , ` Now , Aunt Clara , all the crying in the world ca n't make things any better . '
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 39]: And then she 'd just keep catchin ' hold of me , and sob and kind of holler , and I 'd say , ` DO N'T cry , Aunt Clara -- PLEASE do n't cry . '' '
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 62]: Then , under the influence of some fragmentary survivals of the respectable portion of his Sunday adventures , his theme became more exalted ; and , only partially misquoting a phrase from a psalm , he related how he had made it of comfort to Aunt Clara , and how he had besought her to seek Higher guidance in her trouble .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 24]: The surprising thing about a structure such as Penrod was erecting is that the taller it becomes the more ornamentation it will stand .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 16]: Gifted boys have this faculty of building magnificence upon cobwebs -- and Penrod was gifted .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 53]: Under the spell of his really great performance , Miss Spence gazed more and more sweetly upon the prodigy of spiritual beauty and goodness before her , until at last , when Penrod came to the explanation of his `` just thinking , '' she was forced to turn her head away .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 27]: `` You mean , dear , '' she said gently , `` that you were all worn out and hardly knew what you were saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 20]: `` And you were thinking about all those dreadful things so hard that you forgot where you were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: `` I was thinking , '' he said simply , `` how to save Uncle John . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 16]: And the end of it for this mighty boy was that the teacher kissed him !
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 35]: CHAPTER XI FIDELITY OF A LITTLE DOG The returning students , that afternoon , observed that Penrod 's desk was vacant -- and nothing could have been more impressive than that sinister mere emptiness .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 10]: The accepted theory was that Penrod had been arrested .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 58]: How breathtaking , then , the sensation when , at the beginning of the second hour , he strolled -- in with inimitable carelessness and , rubbing his eyes , somewhat noticeably in the manner of one who has snatched an hour of much needed sleep , took his place as if nothing in particular had happened .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 37]: This , at first supposed to be a superhuman exhibition of sheer audacity , became but the more dumfounding when Miss Spence -- looking up from her desk -- greeted him with a pleasant little nod .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 12]: Even after school , Penrod gave numerous maddened investigators no relief .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 18]: All he would consent to say was : `` Oh , I just TALKED to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 21]: A mystification not entirely unconnected with the one thus produced was manifested at his own family dinner-table the following evening .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 19]: Aunt Clara had been out rather late , and came to the table after the rest were seated .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 6]: She wore a puzzled expression .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 10]: `` Do you ever see Mary Spence nowadays ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 13]: she inquired , as she unfolded her napkin , addressing Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 15]: Penrod abruptly set down his soup-spoon and gazed at his aunt with flattering attention .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 10]: `` Yes ; sometimes , '' said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 8]: `` She 's Penrod 's teacher . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: `` Is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 4]: said Mrs. Farry .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 8]: `` Do you -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 14]: `` Do people think her a little -- queer , these days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: `` Why , no , '' returned her sister .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 8]: `` What makes you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 15]: `` She has acquired a very odd manner , '' said Mrs. Farry decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 10]: `` At least , she seemed odd to ME .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 45]: I met her at the corner just before I got to the house , a few minutes ago , and after we 'd said howdy-do to each other , she kept hold of my hand and looked as though she was going to cry .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 27]: She seemed to be trying to say something , and choking -- '' `` But I do n't think that 's so very queer , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 11]: She knew you in school , did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 30]: `` Yes , but -- '' `` And she had n't seen you for so many years , I think it 's perfectly natural she -- '' `` Wait !
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 46]: She stood there squeezing my hand , and struggling to get her voice -- and I got really embarrassed -- and then finally she said , in a kind of tearful whisper , ` Be of good cheer -- this trial will pass ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: `` How queer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 3]: exclaimed Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 11]: Penrod sighed , and returned somewhat absently to his soup .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: `` Well , I do n't know , '' said Mrs. Schofield thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 52]: `` Of course she 's heard about the outbreak of measles in Dayton , since they had to close the schools , and she knows you live there -- '' `` But does n't it seem a VERY exaggerated way , '' suggested Margaret , `` to talk about measles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 4]: begged Aunt Clara .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 25]: `` After she said that , she said something even queerer , and then put her handkerchief to her eyes and hurried away . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 16]: Penrod laid down his spoon again and moved his chair slightly back from the table .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 26]: A spirit of prophecy was upon him : he knew that someone was going to ask a question which he felt might better remain unspoken .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 10]: `` What WAS the other thing she said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 12]: Mr. Schofield inquired , thus immediately fulfilling his son 's premonition .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 35]: `` She said , '' returned Mrs. Farry slowly , looking about the table , `` she said , ' I know that Penrod is a great , great comfort to you ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: There was a general exclamation of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 43]: It was a singular thing , and in no manner may it be considered complimentary to Penrod , that this speech of Miss Spence 's should have immediately confirmed Mrs. Farry 's doubts about her in the minds of all his family .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 7]: Mr. Schofield shook his head pityingly .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid she 's a goner , '' he went so far as to say .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 8]: `` Of all the weird ideas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: cried Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 12]: `` I never heard anything like it in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 4]: Mrs. Schofield exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 8]: `` Was that ALL she said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 5]: `` Every word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 8]: Penrod again resumed attention to his soup .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 48]: His mother looked at him curiously , and then , struck by a sudden thought , gathered the glances of the adults of the table by a significant movement of the head , and , by another , conveyed an admonition to drop the subject until later .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 26]: Miss Spence was Penrod 's teacher : it was better , for many reasons , not to discuss the subject of her queerness before him .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 10]: This was Mrs. Schofield 's thought at the time .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 11]: Later she had another , and it kept her awake .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 50]: The next afternoon , Mr. Schofield , returning at five o'clock from the cares of the day , found the house deserted , and sat down to read his evening paper in what appeared to be an uninhabited apartment known to its own world as the `` drawing-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 20]: A sneeze , unexpected both to him and the owner , informed him of the presence of another person .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: `` Where are you , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 7]: the parent asked , looking about .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 8]: `` Here , '' said Penrod meekly .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: Stooping , Mr. Schofield discovered his son squatting under the piano , near an open window -- his wistful Duke lying beside him .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 8]: `` What are you doing there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 7]: `` Why under the piano ? ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 24]: `` Well , '' the boy returned , with grave sweetness , `` I was just kind of sitting here -- thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 65]: Mr. Schofield , rather touched , returned to the digestion of a murder , his back once more to the piano ; and Penrod silently drew from beneath his jacket -LRB- where he had slipped it simultaneously with the sneeze -RRB- a paper-backed volume entitled : `` Slimsy , the Sioux City Squealer , or , ` Not Guilty , Your Honor . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 49]: In this manner the reading-club continued in peace , absorbed , contented , the world well forgot -- until a sudden , violently irritated slam-bang of the front door startled the members ; and Mrs. Schofield burst into the room and threw herself into a chair , moaning .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 8]: asked her husband laying aside his paper .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 29]: `` Henry Passloe Schofield , '' returned the lady , `` I do n't know what IS to be done with that boy ; I do NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 6]: `` You mean Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 8]: `` Who else could I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 11]: She sat up , exasperated , to stare at him .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 22]: `` Henry Passloe Schofield , you 've got to take this matter in your hands -- it 's beyond me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 45]: `` Well , what has he -- '' `` Last night I got to thinking , '' she began rapidly , `` about what Clara told us -- thank Heaven she and Margaret and little Clara have gone to tea at Cousin Charlotte 's !
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 28]: -- but they 'll be home soon -- about what she said about Miss Spence -- '' `` You mean about Penrod 's being a comfort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 27]: `` Yes , and I kept thinking and thinking and thinking about it till I could n't stand it any -- '' `` By GEORGE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 12]: shouted Mr. Schofield startlingly , stooping to look under the piano .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 31]: A statement that he had suddenly remembered his son 's presence would be lacking in accuracy , for the highly sensitized Penrod was , in fact , no longer present .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: No more was Duke , his faithful dog .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 16]: `` Nothing , '' he returned , striding to the open window and looking out .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 5]: `` Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 33]: `` Oh , '' she moaned , `` it must be kept from Clara -- and I 'll never hold up my head again if John Farry ever hears of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 6]: `` Hears of WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 77]: `` Well , I just could n't stand it , I got so curious ; and I thought of course if Miss Spence HAD become a little unbalanced it was my duty to know it , as Penrod 's mother and she his teacher ; so I thought I would just call on her at her apartment after school and have a chat and see and I did and -- oh -- '' `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 17]: `` I 've just come from there , and she told me -- she told me !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 11]: Oh , I 've NEVER known anything like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 8]: `` WHAT did she tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 17]: Mrs. Schofield , making a great effort , managed to assume a temporary appearance of calm .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 34]: `` Henry , '' she said solemnly , `` bear this in mind : whatever you do to Penrod , it must be done in some place when Clara wo n't hear it .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 12]: But the first thing to do is to find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 35]: Within view of the window from which Mr. Schofield was gazing was the closed door of the storeroom in the stable , and just outside this door Duke was performing a most engaging trick .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 31]: His young master had taught Duke to `` sit up and beg '' when he wanted anything , and if that did n't get it , to `` speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 25]: Duke was facing the closed door and sitting up and begging , and now he also spoke -- in a loud , clear bark .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 28]: There was an open transom over the door , and from this descended -- hurled by an unseen agency -- a can half filled with old paint .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 32]: It caught the small besieger of the door on his thoroughly surprised right ear , encouraged him to some remarkable acrobatics , and turned large portions of him a dull blue .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 35]: Allowing only a moment to perplexity , and deciding , after a single and evidently unappetizing experiment , not to cleanse himself of paint , the loyal animal resumed his quaint , upright posture .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 21]: Mr. Schofield seated himself on the window-sill , whence he could keep in view that pathetic picture of unrequited love .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 13]: `` Go on with your story , mamma , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 13]: `` I think I can find Penrod when we want him . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 22]: And a few minutes later he added , `` And I think I know the place to do it in . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 15]: Again the faithful voice of Duke was heard , pleading outside the bolted door .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 13]: CHAPTER XII MISS RENNSDALE ACCEPTS `` One-two-three ; one-two-three -- glide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 19]: said Professor Bartet , emphasizing his instructions by a brisk collision of his palms at `` glide . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 8]: `` One-two-three ; one-two-three -- glide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 16]: The school week was over , at last , but Penrod 's troubles were not .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 18]: Round and round the ballroom went the seventeen struggling little couples of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 64]: Round and round went their reflections with them , swimming rhythmically in the polished , dark floor -- white and blue and pink for the girls ; black , with dabs of white , for the white-collared , white-gloved boys ; and sparks and slivers of high light everywhere as the glistening pumps flickered along the surface like a school of flying fish .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 16]: Every small pink face -- with one exception -- was painstaking and set for duty .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 7]: It was a conscientious little merry-go-round .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 7]: `` One-two-three ; one-two-three -- glide !
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 6]: One-two-three ; one-two-three -- glide !
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 4]: One-two-th -- Ha !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: Mister Penrod Schofield , you lose the step .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 4]: Your left foot !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 5]: This is the left !
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 5]: See -- like me !
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 3]: Now again !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 6]: One-two-three ; one-two-three -- glide !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 2]: Better !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 3]: Much better !
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 2]: Again !
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 8]: One-two-three ; one-two-three -- gl -- Stop !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 29]: Mr. Penrod Schofield , this dancing class is provided by the kind parents of the pupilses as much to learn the mannerss of good societies as to dance .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 23]: You think you shall ever see a gentleman in good societies to tickle his partner in the dance till she say Ouch ?
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 8]: I assure you it is not done .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 2]: Again !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 3]: Now then !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: Piano , please !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 6]: One-two-three ; one-two-three -- glide !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 12]: Mr. Penrod Schofield , your right foot -- your right foot !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 3]: Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 7]: The merry-go-round came to a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 21]: `` Mr. Penrod Schofield and partner '' -- Professor Bartet wiped his brow -- `` will you kindly observe me ?
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 4]: One-two-three -- glide !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 16]: Now then -- no ; you will please keep your places , ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 17]: Mr. Penrod Schofield , I would puttickly like your attention , this is for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: `` Pickin ' on me again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 11]: murmured the smouldering Penrod to his small , unsympathetic partner .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: `` Ca n't let me alone a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 16]: `` Mister Georgie Bassett , please step to the centre , '' said the professor .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 7]: Mr. Bassett complied with modest alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 6]: `` Teacher 's pet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 4]: whispered Penrod hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 9]: He had nothing but contempt for Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 64]: The parents , guardians , aunts , uncles , cousins , governesses , housemaids , cooks , chauffeurs and coachmen , appertaining to the members of the dancing class , all dwelt in the same part of town and shared certain communal theories ; and among the most firmly established was that which maintained Georgie Bassett to be the Best Boy in Town .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 35]: Contrariwise , the unfortunate Penrod , largely because of his recent dazzling but disastrous attempts to control forces far beyond him , had been given a clear title as the Worst Boy in Town .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 6]: -LRB- Population , 135,000 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 18]: To precisely what degree his reputation was the product of his own energies can not be calculated .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 56]: It was Marjorie Jones who first applied the description , in its definite simplicity , the day after the `` pageant , '' and , possibly , her frequent and effusive repetitions of it , even upon wholly irrelevant occasions , had something to do with its prompt and quite perfect acceptance by the community .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 25]: `` Miss Rennsdale will please do me the fafer to be Mr. Georgie Bassett 's partner for one moment , '' said Professor Bartet .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 10]: `` Mr. Penrod Schofield will please give his attention .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 13]: Miss Rennsdale and Mister Bassett , obliche me , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 4]: Others please watch .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 4]: Piano , please !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 4]: Now then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 31]: Miss Rennsdale , aged eight -- the youngest lady in the class -- and Mr. Georgie Bassett one-two-three -- glided with consummate technique for the better education of Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 35]: It is possible that amber-curled , beautiful Marjorie felt that she , rather than Miss Rennsdale , might have been selected as the example of perfection -- or perhaps her remark was only woman .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 8]: `` Stopping everybody for that boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 3]: said Marjorie .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 31]: Penrod , across the circle from her , heard distinctly -- nay , he was obviously intended to hear ; but over a scorched heart he preserved a stoic front .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 23]: Whereupon Marjorie whispered derisively in the ear of her partner , Maurice Levy , who wore a pearl pin in his tie .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 12]: `` Again , please , everybody -- ladies and gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 4]: cried Professor Bartet .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 13]: `` Mister Penrod Schofield , if you please , pay puttickly attention !
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 4]: Piano , please !
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 4]: Now then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 4]: The lesson proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 22]: At the close of the hour Professor Bartet stepped to the centre of the room and clapped his hands for attention .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 26]: `` Ladies and gentlemen , if you please to seat yourselves quietly , '' he said ; `` I speak to you now about to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 21]: As you all know -- Mister Penrod Schofield , I am not sticking up in a tree outside that window !
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 17]: If you do me the fafer to examine I am here , insides of the room .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 3]: Now then !
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 13]: Piano , pl -- no , I do not wish the piano !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 17]: As you all know , this is the last lesson of the season until next October .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 15]: Tomorrow is our special afternoon ; beginning three o'clock , we dance the cotillon .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 9]: But this afternoon comes the test of mannerss .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 21]: You must see if each know how to make a little formal call like a grown-up people in good societies .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 27]: You have had good , perfect instruction ; let us see if we know how to perform like societies ladies and gentlemen twenty-six years of age .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 21]: `` Now , when you 're dismissed each lady will go to her home and prepare to receive a call .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 41]: The gentlemen will allow the ladies time to reach their houses and to prepare to receive callers ; then each gentleman will call upon a lady and beg the pleasure to engage her for a partner in the cotillon to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 29]: You all know the correct , proper form for these calls , because did n't I work teaching you last lesson till I thought I would drop dead ?
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 53]: Now each gentleman , if he reach a lady 's house behind some-other gentleman , then he must go somewhere else to a lady 's house , and keep calling until he secures a partner ; so , as there are the same number of both , everybody shall have a partner .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 58]: `` Now please all remember that if in case -- Mister Penrod Schofield , when you make your call on a lady I beg you to please remember that gentlemen in good societies do not scratch the back in societies as you appear to attempt ; so please allow the hands to rest carelessly in the lap .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 17]: Now please all remember that if in case -- Mister Penrod Schofield , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 22]: Gentlemen in societies do not scratch the back by causing frictions between it and the back of your chair , either !
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 6]: Nobody else is itching here !
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: _ I _ do not itch !
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 9]: I can not talk if you must itch !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 12]: In the name of Heaven , why must you always itch ?
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 5]: What was I saying ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 3]: Where ah !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 5]: the cotillon -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 58]: For the cotillon it is important nobody shall fail to be here tomorrow ; but if any one should be so very ill he can not possible come he must write a very polite note of regrets in the form of good societies to his engaged partner to excuse himself -- and he must give the reason .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 34]: `` I do not think anybody is going to be that sick to-morrow -- no ; and I will find out and report to parents if anybody would try it and not be .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 64]: But it is important for the cotillon that we have an even number of so many couples , and if it should happen that someone comes and her partner has sent her a polite note that he has genuine reasons why he can not come , the note must be handed at once to me , so that I arrange some other partner .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 4]: Is all understood ?
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 22]: The gentlemen will remember now to allow the ladies plenty of time to reach their houses and prepare to receive calls .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 13]: Ladies and gentlemen , I thank you for your polite attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 54]: It was nine blocks to the house of Marjorie Jones ; but Penrod did it in less than seven minutes from a flying start -- such was his haste to lay himself and his hand for the cotillon at the feet of one who had so recently spoken unamiably of him in public .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 30]: He had not yet learned that the only safe male rebuke to a scornful female is to stay away from her -- especially if that is what she desires .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 22]: However , he did not wish to rebuke her ; simply and ardently he wished to dance the cotillon with her .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 7]: Resentment was swallowed up in hope .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 28]: The fact that Miss Jones ' feeling for him bore a striking resemblance to that of Simon Legree for Uncle Tom , deterred him not at all .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 48]: Naturally , he was not wholly unconscious that when he should lay his hand for the cotillon at her feet it would be her inward desire to step on it ; but he believed that if he were first in the field Marjorie would have to accept .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 7]: These things are governed by law .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 31]: It was his fond intention to reach her house even in advance of herself , and with grave misgiving he beheld a large automobile at rest before the sainted gate .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 24]: Forthwith , a sinking feeling became a portent inside him as little Maurice Levy emerged from the front door of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 6]: ` Lo , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 4]: said Maurice airily .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 9]: `` What you doin ' in there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 3]: inquired Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: `` In where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 6]: `` In Marjorie 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 15]: `` Well , what should n't I be doin ' in Marjorie 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 5]: Mr. Levy returned indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 19]: `` I was inviting her for my partner in the cotillon -- what you s ` pose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: `` You have n't got any right to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 4]: Penrod protested hotly .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 9]: `` You ca n't do it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 8]: `` I did do it yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 3]: said Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 6]: `` You ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 3]: insisted Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 9]: `` You got to allow them time first .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 13]: He said the ladies had to be allowed time to prepare . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 12]: `` Well , ai n't she had time to prepare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: Penrod demanded , stepping close to his rival threateningly .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 13]: `` I 'd like to know when -- '' `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 7]: echoed the other with shrill triumph .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 3]: `` When ?
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 18]: Why , in mamma 's sixty-horse powder limousine automobile , what Marjorie came home with me in !
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 7]: I guess that 's when ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 15]: An impulse in the direction of violence became visible upon the countenance of Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 14]: `` I expect you need some wiping down , '' he began dangerously .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 17]: `` I 'll give you sumpthing to remem -- '' `` Oh , you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 19]: Maurice cried with astonishing truculence , contorting himself into what he may have considered a posture of defense .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 14]: `` Let 's see you try it , you -- you itcher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 12]: For the moment , defiance from such a source was dumfounding .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 13]: Then , luckily , Penrod recollected something and glanced at the automobile .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 38]: Perceiving therein not only the alert chauffeur but the magnificent outlines of Mrs. Levy , his enemy 's mother , he manoeuvred his lifted hand so that it seemed he had but meant to scratch his ear .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 16]: `` Well , I guess I better be goin ' , '' he said casually .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 6]: `` See you tomorrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 61]: Maurice mounted to the lap of luxury , and Penrod strolled away with an assumption of careless ease which was put to a severe strain when , from the rear window of the car , a sudden protuberance in the nature of a small , dark , curly head shrieked scornfully : `` Go on -- you big stiff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 27]: The cotillon loomed dismally before Penrod now ; but it was his duty to secure a partner and he set about it with a dreary heart .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 34]: The delay occasioned by his fruitless attempt on Marjorie and the altercation with his enemy at her gate had allowed other ladies ample time to prepare for callers -- and to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 20]: Sadly he went from house to house , finding that he had been preceded in one after the other .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 20]: Altogether his hand for the cotillon was declined eleven times that afternoon on the legitimate ground of previous engagement .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 41]: This , with Marjorie , scored off all except five of the seventeen possible partners ; and four of the five were also sealed away from him , as he learned in chance encounters with other boys upon the street .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 26]: One lady alone remained ; he bowed to the inevitable and entered this lorn damsel 's gate at twilight with an air of great discouragement .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 10]: The lorn damsel was Miss Rennsdale , aged eight .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 20]: We are apt to forget that there are actually times of life when too much youth is a handicap .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 18]: Miss Rennsdale was beautiful ; she danced like a premiere ; she had every charm but age .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 33]: On that account alone had she been allowed so much time to prepare to receive callers that it was only by the most manful efforts she could keep her lip from trembling .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 20]: A decorous maid conducted the long-belated applicant to her where she sat upon a sofa beside a nursery governess .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 12]: The decorous maid announced him composedly as he made his entrance .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 6]: `` Mr. Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 8]: Miss Rennsdale suddenly burst into loud sobs .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 10]: `` I just knew it would be him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 13]: The decorous maid 's composure vanished at once -- likewise her decorum .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 13]: She clapped her hand over her mouth and fled , uttering sounds .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 39]: The governess , however , set herself to comfort her heartbroken charge , and presently succeeded in restoring Miss Rennsdale to a semblance of that poise with which a lady receives callers and accepts invitations to dance cotillons .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: But she continued to sob at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 21]: Feeling himself at perhaps a disadvantage , Penrod made offer of his hand for the morrow with a little embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 20]: Following the form prescribed by Professor Bartet , he advanced several paces toward the stricken lady and bowed formally .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 23]: `` I hope , '' he said by rote , `` you 're well , and your parents also in good health .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 19]: May I have the pleasure of dancing the cotillon as your partner t ' - morrow afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 35]: The wet eyes of Miss Rennsdale searched his countenance without pleasure , and a shudder wrung her small shoulders ; but the governess whispered to her instructively , and she made a great effort .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 24]: `` I thu-thank you fu-for your polite invu-invu-invutation ; and I ac -- '' Thus far she progressed when emotion overcame her again .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 11]: She beat frantically upon the sofa with fists and heels .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 13]: `` Oh , I DID want it to be Georgie Bassett ! ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 8]: `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 18]: said the governess , and whispered urgently , whereupon Miss Rennsdale was able to complete her acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 8]: `` And I ac-accept wu-with pu-pleasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 24]: she moaned , and immediately , uttering a loud yell , flung herself face downward upon the sofa , clutching her governess convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 7]: Somewhat disconcerted , Penrod bowed again .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 25]: `` I thank you for your polite acceptance , '' he murmured hurriedly ; `` and I trust -- I trust -- I forget .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 14]: Oh , yes -- I trust we shall have a most enjoyable occasion .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 20]: Pray present my compliments to your parents ; and I must now wish you a very good afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 33]: Concluding these courtly demonstrations with another bow he withdrew in fair order , though thrown into partial confusion in the hall by a final wail from his crushed hostess : `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 10]: Why could n't it be anybody but HIM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 21]: CHAPTER XIII THE SMALLPOX MEDICINE Next morning Penrod woke in profound depression of spirit , the cotillon ominous before him .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 42]: He pictured Marjorie Jones and Maurice , graceful and light-hearted , flitting by him fairylike , loosing silvery laughter upon him as he engaged in the struggle to keep step with a partner about four years and two feet his junior .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 16]: It was hard enough for Penrod to keep step with a girl of his size .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 15]: The foreboding vision remained with him , increasing in vividness , throughout the forenoon .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 42]: He found himself unable to fix his mind upon anything else , and , having bent his gloomy footsteps toward the sawdust-box , after breakfast , presently descended therefrom , abandoning Harold Ramorez where he had left him the preceding Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 21]: Then , as he sat communing silently with wistful Duke , in the storeroom , coquettish fortune looked his way .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 64]: It was the habit of Penrod 's mother not to throw away anything whatsoever until years of storage conclusively proved there would never be a use for it ; but a recent house-cleaning had ejected upon the back porch a great quantity of bottles and other paraphernalia of medicine , left over from illnesses in the family during a period of several years .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 55]: This debris Della , the cook , had collected in a large market basket , adding to it some bottles of flavouring extracts that had proved unpopular in the household ; also , old catsup bottles ; a jar or two of preserves gone bad ; various rejected dental liquids -- and other things .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 13]: And she carried the basket out to the storeroom in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 11]: Penrod was at first unaware of what lay before him .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 29]: Chin on palms , he sat upon the iron rim of a former aquarium and stared morbidly through the open door at the checkered departing back of Della .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 13]: It was another who saw treasure in the basket she had left .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 40]: Mr. Samuel Williams , aged eleven , and congenial to Penrod in years , sex , and disposition , appeared in the doorway , shaking into foam a black liquid within a pint bottle , stoppered by a thumb .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 5]: the visitor gave greeting .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 10]: `` Yay , '' said Penrod with slight enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: `` What you got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 5]: `` Lickrish water . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 5]: `` Drinkin 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 4]: demanded Penrod promptly .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 21]: This is equivalent to the cry of `` Biters '' when an apple is shown , and establishes unquestionable title .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 6]: `` Down to there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 32]: stipulated Sam , removing his thumb to affix it firmly as a mark upon the side of the bottle a check upon gormandizing that remained carefully in place while Penrod drank .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 16]: This rite concluded , the visitor 's eye fell upon the basket deposited by Della .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 6]: He emitted tokens of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 3]: `` Looky !
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 2]: Looky !
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 3]: Looky there !
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 15]: That ai n't any good pile o ' stuff -- oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 5]: `` Drug store ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 3]: shouted Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 32]: `` We 'll be partners -- '' `` Or else , '' Penrod suggested , `` I 'll run the drug store and you be a customer -- '' `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 3]: Partners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 26]: insisted Sam with such conviction that his host yielded ; and within ten minutes the drug store was doing a heavy business with imaginary patrons .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 37]: Improvising counters with boards and boxes , and setting forth a very druggish-looking stock from the basket , each of the partners found occupation to his taste -- Penrod as salesman and Sam as prescription clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 8]: `` Here you are , madam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 16]: said Penrod briskly , offering a vial of Sam 's mixing to an invisible matron .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 11]: `` This will cure your husband in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 7]: Here 's the camphor , mister .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 3]: Call again !
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 7]: Fifty cents ' worth of pills ?
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 4]: Yes , madam .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 4]: There you are !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 13]: Hurry up with that dose for the nigger lady , Bill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 21]: `` I 'll ` tend to it soon 's I get time , Jim , '' replied the prescription clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 16]: `` I 'm busy fixin ' the smallpox medicine for the sick policeman downtown . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 8]: Penrod stopped sales to watch this operation .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 30]: Sam had found an empty pint bottle and , with the pursed lips and measuring eye of a great chemist , was engaged in filling it from other bottles .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 95]: First , he poured into it some of the syrup from the condemned preserves ; and a quantity of extinct hair oil ; next the remaining contents of a dozen small vials cryptically labelled with physicians ' prescriptions ; then some remnants of catsup and essence of beef and what was left in several bottles of mouthwash ; after that a quantity of rejected flavouring extract -- topping off by shaking into the mouth of the bottle various powders from small pink papers , relics of Mr. Schofield 's influenza of the preceding winter .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 10]: Sam examined the combination with concern , appearing unsatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 13]: `` We got to make that smallpox medicine good and strong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 29]: he remarked ; and , his artistic sense growing more powerful than his appetite , he poured about a quarter of the licorice water into the smallpox medicine .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 7]: `` What you doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 3]: protested Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 11]: `` What you want to waste that lickrish water for ?
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 13]: We ought to keep it to drink when we 're tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 25]: `` I guess I got a right to use my own lickrish water any way I want to , '' replied the prescription clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 14]: `` I tell you , you ca n't get smallpox medicine too strong .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 6]: Look at her now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 7]: He held the bottle up admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 8]: `` She 's as black as lickrish .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 10]: I bet you she 's strong all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 8]: `` I wonder how she tastes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 4]: said Penrod thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 24]: `` Do n't smell so awful much , '' observed Sam , sniffing the bottle -- `` a good deal , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 14]: `` I wonder if it 'd make us sick to drink it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 48]: Sam looked at the bottle thoughtfully ; then his eye , wandering , fell upon Duke , placidly curled up near the door , and lighted with the advent of an idea new to him , but old , old in the world -- older than Egypt !
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 8]: `` Let 's give Duke some ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 5]: That was the spark .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 32]: They acted immediately ; and a minute later Duke , released from custody with a competent potion of the smallpox medicine inside him , settled conclusively their doubts concerning its effect .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 54]: The patient animal , accustomed to expect the worst at all times , walked out of the door , shaking his head with an air of considerable annoyance , opening and closing his mouth with singular energy -- and so repeatedly that they began to count the number of times he did it .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 20]: Sam thought it was thirty-nine times , but Penrod had counted forty-one before other and more striking symptoms appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 17]: All things come from Mother Earth and must return -- Duke restored much at this time .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 31]: Afterward , he ate heartily of grass ; and then , over his shoulder , he bent upon his master one inscrutable look and departed feebly to the front yard .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 11]: The two boys had watched the process with warm interest .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 9]: `` I told you she was strong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 5]: said Mr. Williams proudly .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir -- she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: Penrod was generous enough to admit .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 28]: `` I expect she 's strong enough -- '' He paused in thought , and added : `` We have n't got a horse any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 13]: `` I bet you she 'd fix him if you had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 11]: And it may be that this was no idle boast .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 25]: The pharmaceutical game was not resumed ; the experiment upon Duke had made the drug store commonplace and stimulated the appetite for stronger meat .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 14]: Lounging in the doorway , the near-vivisectionists sipped licorice water alternately and conversed .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 17]: `` I bet some of our smallpox medicine would fix ole P'fessor Bartet all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 3]: quoth Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 14]: `` I wish he 'd come along and ask us for some . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 18]: `` We could tell him it was lickrish water , '' added Sam , liking the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 10]: `` The two bottles look almost the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 19]: `` Then we would n't have to go to his ole cotillon this afternoon , '' Penrod sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 8]: `` There would n't be any ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 9]: `` Who 's your partner , Pen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: `` Who 's yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 5]: `` Who 's yours ?
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 6]: I just ast you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 9]: `` Oh , she 's all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 5]: And Penrod smiled boastfully .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 11]: `` I bet you wanted to dance with Marjorie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 4]: said his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 13]: I would n't dance with that girl if she begged me to !
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 12]: I would n't dance with her to save her from drowning !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 16]: I would n't da -- '' `` Oh , no -- you would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: interrupted Mr. Williams skeptically .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 8]: Penrod changed his tone and became persuasive .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: `` Looky here , Sam , '' he said confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 32]: `` I 've got ' a mighty nice partner , but my mother do n't like her mother ; and so I 've been thinking I better not dance with her .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 34]: I 'll tell you what I 'll do ; I 've got a mighty good sling in the house , and I 'll give it to you if you 'll change partners . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 16]: `` You want to change and you do n't even know who mine is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 19]: said Sam , and he made the simple though precocious deduction : `` Yours must be a lala !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 19]: Well , I invited Mabel Rorebeck , and she would n't let me change if I wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 29]: Mabel Rorebeck 'd rather dance with me , '' he continued serenely , `` than anybody ; and she said she was awful afraid you 'd ast her .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 43]: But I ai n't goin ' to dance with Mabel after all , because this morning she sent me a note about her uncle died last night -- and P'fessor Bartet 'll have to find me a partner after I get there .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 20]: Anyway I bet you have n't got any sling -- and I bet your partner 's Baby Rennsdale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 7]: `` What if she is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 9]: `` She 's good enough for ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 16]: This speech held not so much modesty in solution as intended praise of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 16]: Taken literally , however , it was an understatement of the facts and wholly insincere .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 4]: `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: jeered Mr. Williams , upon whom his friend 's hypocrisy was quite wasted .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: `` How can your mother not like her mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: Baby Rennsdale has n't got any mother !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 9]: You and her 'll be a sight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 24]: That was Penrod 's own conviction ; and with this corroboration of it he grew so spiritless that he could offer no retort .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 48]: He slid to a despondent sitting posture upon the door sill and gazed wretchedly upon the ground , while his companion went to replenish the licorice water at the hydrant -- enfeebling the potency of the liquor no doubt , but making up for that in quantity .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 12]: `` Your mother goin ' with you to the cotillon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 6]: asked Sam when he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 9]: She 's goin ' to meet me there .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 8]: She 's goin ' somewhere first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: `` So 's mine , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 9]: `` I 'll come by for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 7]: `` I better go before long .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 7]: Noon whistles been blowin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: `` All right , '' Penrod repeated dully .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 8]: Sam turned to go , but paused .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 14]: A new straw hat was peregrinating along the fence near the two boys .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 20]: This hat belonged to someone passing upon the sidewalk of the cross-street ; and the someone was Maurice Levy .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 20]: Even as they stared , he halted and regarded them over the fence with two small , dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 10]: Fate had brought about this moment and this confrontation .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 12]: CHAPTER XIV MAURICE LEVY 'S CONSTITUTION `` Lo , Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 4]: said Maurice cautiously .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 7]: `` What you doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 21]: Penrod at that instant had a singular experience -- an intellectual shock like a flash of fire in the brain .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 13]: Sitting in darkness , a great light flooded him with wild brilliance .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 3]: He gasped !
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: `` What you doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 4]: repeated Mr. Levy .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 26]: Penrod sprang to his feet , seized the licorice bottle , shook it with stoppering thumb , and took a long drink with histrionic unction .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: `` What you doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 16]: asked Maurice for the third time , Sam Williams not having decided upon a reply .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 6]: It was Penrod who answered .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 28]: `` Drinkin ' lickrish water , '' he said simply , and wiped his mouth with such delicious enjoyment that Sam 's jaded thirst was instantly stimulated .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 8]: He took the bottle eagerly from Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 4]: `` A-a-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 7]: exclaimed Penrod , smacking his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 8]: `` That was a good un ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 7]: The eyes above the fence glistened .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 15]: `` Ask him if he do n't want some , '' Penrod whispered urgently .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 6]: `` Quit drinkin ' it !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 7]: It 's no good any more .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 4]: Ask him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 5]: demanded the practical Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: `` Go on and ask him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 4]: whispered Penrod fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 6]: `` Say , M'rice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 7]: Sam called , waving the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 5]: `` Want some ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 6]: `` Bring it here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 4]: Mr. Levy requested .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 15]: `` Come on over and get some , '' returned Sam , being prompted .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: Penrod Schofield 's after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 12]: `` No , I 'm not , '' said Penrod reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 9]: `` I wo n't touch you , M'rice .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 13]: I made up with you yesterday afternoon -- do n't you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 10]: You 're all right with me , M'rice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: Maurice looked undecided .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 38]: But Penrod had the delectable bottle again , and tilting it above his lips , affected to let the cool liquid purl enrichingly into him , while with his right hand he stroked his middle facade ineffably .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 5]: Maurice 's mouth watered .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 13]: cried Sam , stirred again by the superb manifestations of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 6]: `` Gim me that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 27]: Penrod brought the bottle down , surprisingly full after so much gusto , but withheld it from Sam ; and the two scuffled for its possession .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 19]: Nothing in the world could have so worked upon the desire of the yearning observer beyond the fence .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 21]: `` Honest , Penrod -- you ai n't goin ' to touch me if I come in your yard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 3]: he called .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 4]: `` Honest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: `` Cross my heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 10]: answered Penrod , holding the bottle away from Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 12]: `` And we 'll let you drink all you want . ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: Maurice hastily climbed the fence , and while he was thus occupied Mr. Samuel Williams received a great enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 50]: With startling rapidity Penrod , standing just outside the storeroom door , extended his arm within the room , deposited the licorice water upon the counter of the drug store , seized in its stead the bottle of smallpox medicine , and extended it cordially toward the advancing Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 12]: Genius is like that -- great , simple , broad strokes !
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 10]: Dazzled , Mr. Samuel Williams leaned against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 16]: He had the sensations of one who comes suddenly into the presence of a chef-d'oeuvre .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 27]: Perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost universal one on such huge occasions : `` Why could n't _ I _ have done that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 29]: Sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he figured not altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent conception of the new Talleyrand .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 8]: Sam had no partner for the cotillon .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 47]: If Maurice was to be absent from that festivity -- as it began to seem he might be -- Penrod needed a male friend to take care of Miss Rennsdale and he believed he saw his way to compel Mr. Williams to be that male friend .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 32]: For this he relied largely upon the prospective conduct of Miss Rennsdale when he should get the matter before her -- he was inclined to believe she would favour the exchange .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 17]: As for Talleyrand Penrod himself , he was going to dance that cotillon with Marjorie Jones !
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 19]: `` You can have all you can drink at one pull , M'rice , '' said Penrod kindly .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: `` You said I could have all I want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 8]: protested Maurice , reaching for the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 20]: `` No , I did n't , '' returned Penrod quickly , holding it away from the eager hand .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 6]: `` He did , too !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 7]: Did n't he , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 16]: Sam could not reply ; his eyes , fixed upon the bottle , protruded strangely .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 12]: `` You heard him -- did n't you , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 15]: `` Well , if I did say it I did n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 11]: said Penrod hastily , quoting from one of the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 27]: `` Looky here , M'rice , '' he continued , assuming a more placative and reasoning tone , `` that would n't be fair to us .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 15]: I guess we want some of our own lickrish water , do n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 10]: The bottle ai n't much over two-thirds full anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 17]: What I meant was , you can have all you can drink at one pull . ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 35]: `` Why , this way : you can gulp all you want , so long as you keep swallering ; but you ca n't take the bottle out of your mouth and commence again .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 12]: Soon 's you quit swallering it 's Sam 's turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 14]: `` No ; you can have next , Penrod , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 21]: `` Well , anyway , I mean M'rice has to give the bottle up the minute he stops swallering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 16]: Craft appeared upon the face of Maurice , like a poster pasted on a wall .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 13]: `` I can drink so long I do n't stop swallering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 8]: `` Yes ; that 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 5]: `` All right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 7]: `` Gim me the bottle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 8]: And Penrod placed it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 13]: `` You promise to let me drink until I quit swallering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 3]: Maurice insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 5]: said both boys together .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 15]: With that , Maurice placed the bottle to his lips and began to drink .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 9]: Penrod and Sam leaned forward in breathless excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 24]: They had feared Maurice might smell the contents of the bottle ; but that danger was past -- this was the crucial moment .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 23]: Their fondest hope was that he would make his first swallow a voracious one -- it was impossible to imagine a second .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 16]: They expected one big , gulping swallow and then an explosion , with fountain effects .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 9]: Little they knew the mettle of their man !
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 17]: Maurice swallowed once ; he swallowed twice -- and thrice -- and he continued to swallow !
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 26]: No Adam 's apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat , but the internal progress of the liquid was not a whit the less visible .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 35]: His eyes gleamed with cunning and malicious triumph , sidewise , at the stunned conspirators ; he was fulfilling the conditions of the draught , not once breaking the thread of that marvelous swallering .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 5]: His audience stood petrified .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 20]: Already Maurice had swallowed more than they had given Duke and still the liquor receded in the uplifted bottle !
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 23]: And now the clear glass gleamed above the dark contents full half the vessel 's length -- and Maurice went on drinking !
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 14]: Slowly the clear glass increased in its dimensions -- slowly the dark diminished .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 44]: Sam Williams made a horrified movement to check him -- but Maurice protested passionately with his disengaged arm , and made vehement vocal noises remindful of the contract ; whereupon Sam desisted and watched the continuing performance in a state of grisly fascination .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 5]: Maurice drank it all !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 21]: He drained the last drop and threw the bottle in the air , uttering loud ejaculations of triumph and satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 26]: he cried , blowing out his cheeks , inflating his chest , squaring his shoulders , patting his stomach , and wiping his mouth contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 3]: `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 2]: Aha !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 2]: Waha !
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 2]: Wafwah !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 6]: But that was good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: The two boys stood looking at him in stupor .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 28]: `` Well , I got ta say this , '' said Maurice graciously : `` You stuck to your bargain all right and treated me fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 30]: Stricken with a sudden horrible suspicion , Penrod entered the storeroom in one stride and lifted the bottle of licorice water to his nose -- then to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 13]: It was weak , but good ; he had made no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 78]: And Maurice had really drained -- to the dregs -- the bottle of old hair tonics , dead catsups , syrups of undesirable preserves , condemned extracts of vanilla and lemon , decayed chocolate , ex-essence of beef , mixed dental preparations , aromatic spirits of ammonia , spirits of nitre , alcohol , arnica , quinine , ipecac , sal volatile , nux vomica and licorice water -- with traces of arsenic , belladonna and strychnine .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 15]: Penrod put the licorice water out of sight and turned to face the others .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 22]: Maurice was seating himself on a box just outside the door and had taken a package of cigarettes from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 12]: `` Nobody can see me from here , can they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 7]: he said , striking a match .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 6]: `` You fellers smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 12]: `` No , '' said Sam , staring at him haggardly .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 10]: `` No , '' said Penrod in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 8]: Maurice lit his cigarette and puffed showily .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 23]: `` Well , sir , '' he remarked , `` you fellers are certainly square -- I got ta say that much .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: Honest , Penrod , I thought you was after me !
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 42]: I did think so , '' he added sunnily ; `` but now I guess you like me , or else you would n't of stuck to it about lettin ' me drink it all if I kept on swallering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 13]: He chatted on with complete geniality , smoking his cigarette in content .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 20]: And as he ran from one topic to another his hearers stared at him in a kind of torpor .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 18]: Never once did they exchange a glance with each other ; their eyes were frozen to Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 13]: The cheerful conversationalist made it evident that he was not without gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 42]: `` Well , '' he said as he finished his cigarette and rose to go , `` you fellers have treated me nice and some day you come over to my yard ; I 'd like to run with you fellers .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 10]: You 're the kind of fellers I like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 15]: Penrod 's jaw fell ; Sam 's mouth had been open all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 3]: Neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 15]: `` I got ta go , '' observed Maurice , consulting a handsome watch .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 12]: `` Got ta get dressed for the cotillon right after lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: Come on , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: Do n't you have to go , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 4]: Sam nodded dazedly .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 12]: `` Well , good-bye , Penrod , '' said Maurice cordially .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 10]: `` I 'm glad you like me all right .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 6]: Come on , Sam . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 19]: Penrod leaned against the doorpost and with fixed and glazing eyes watched the departure of his two visitors .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 35]: Maurice was talking volubly , with much gesticulation , as they went ; but Sam walked mechanically and in silence , staring at his brisk companion and keeping at a little distance from him .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 26]: They passed from sight , Maurice still conversing gayly -- and Penrod slowly betook himself into the house , his head bowed upon his chest .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 33]: Some three hours later , Mr. Samuel Williams , waxen clean and in sweet raiment , made his reappearance in Penrod 's yard , yodelling a code-signal to summon forth his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 19]: He yodelled loud , long , and frequently , finally securing a faint response from the upper air .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 6]: `` Where are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: shouted Mr. Williams , his roving glance searching ambient heights .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 24]: Another low-spirited yodel reaching his ear , he perceived the head and shoulders of his friend projecting above the roofridge of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 32]: The rest of Penrod 's body was concealed from view , reposing upon the opposite slant of the gable and precariously secured by the crooking of his elbows over the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 3]: `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 8]: What you doin ' up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 5]: `` Nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 7]: `` You better be careful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 3]: Sam called .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 18]: `` You 'll slide off and fall down in the alley if you do n't look out .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 13]: I come pert ' near it last time we was up there .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 4]: Come on down !
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: Ai n't you goin ' to the cotillon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 5]: Penrod made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 4]: Sam came nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 38]: `` Say , '' he called up in a guarded voice , `` I went to our telephone a while ago and ast him how he was feelin ' , and he said he felt fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 9]: `` So did I , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 9]: `` He told me he felt bully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: Sam thrust his hands in his pockets and brooded .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 10]: The opening of the kitchen door caused a diversion .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: It was Della .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 18]: `` Mister Penrod , '' she bellowed forthwith , `` come ahn down fr 'm up there !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 36]: Y' r mamma 's at the dancin ' class waitin ' fer ye , an ' she 's telephoned me they 're goin ' to begin -- an ' what 's the matter with ye ?
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 9]: Come ahn down fr 'm up there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 5]: `` Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 3]: urged Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 6]: `` We 'll be late .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 8]: There go Maurice and Marjorie now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 26]: A glittering car spun by , disclosing briefly a genre picture of Marjorie Jones in pink , supporting a monstrous sheaf of American Beauty roses .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 25]: Maurice , sitting shining and joyous beside her , saw both boys and waved them a hearty greeting as the car turned the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 33]: Penrod uttered some muffled words and then waved both arms -- either in response or as an expression of his condition of mind ; it may have been a gesture of despair .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 25]: How much intention there was in this act -- obviously so rash , considering the position he occupied -- it is impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 10]: Undeniably there must remain a suspicion of deliberate purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 6]: Della screamed and Sam shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 6]: Penrod had disappeared from view .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 16]: The delayed dance was about to begin a most uneven cotillon when Samuel Williams arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 26]: Mrs. Schofield hurriedly left the ballroom ; while Miss Rennsdale , flushing with sudden happiness , curtsied profoundly to Professor Bartet and obtained his attention .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 26]: `` I have telled you fifty times , '' he informed her passionately ere she spoke , `` I can not make no such changes .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 11]: If your partner comes you have to dance with him .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 10]: You are going to drive me crazy , sure !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 3]: What now ?
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 5]: What you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 44]: The damsel curtsied again and handed him the following communication , addressed to herself : `` Dear madam Please excuse me from dancing the cotilon with you this afternoon as I have fell off the barn `` Sincerly yours `` PENROD SCHOFIELD . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 29]: CHAPTER XV THE TWO FAMILIES Penrod entered the schoolroom , Monday picturesquely leaning upon a man 's cane shortened to support a cripple approaching the age of twelve .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 48]: He arrived about twenty minutes late , limping deeply , his brave young mouth drawn with pain , and the sensation he created must have been a solace to him ; the only possible criticism of this entrance being that it was just a shade too heroic .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 41]: Perhaps for that reason it failed to stagger Miss Spence , a woman so saturated with suspicion that she penalized Penrod for tardiness as promptly and as coldly as if he had been a mere , ordinary , unmutilated boy .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 13]: Nor would she entertain any discussion of the justice of her ruling .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 13]: It seemed , almost , that she feared to argue with him .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 68]: However , the distinction of cane and limp remained to him , consolations which he protracted far into the week -- until Thursday evening , in fact , when Mr. Schofield , observing from a window his son 's pursuit of Duke round and round the backyard , confiscated the cane , with the promise that it should not remain idle if he saw Penrod limping again .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 16]: Thus , succeeding a depressing Friday , another Saturday brought the necessity for new inventions .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: It was a scented morning in apple-blossom time .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 14]: At about ten of the clock Penrod emerged hastily from the kitchen door .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 16]: His pockets bulged abnormally ; so did his checks , and he swallowed with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 40]: A threatening mop , wielded by a cooklike arm in a checkered sleeve , followed him through the doorway , and he was preceded by a small , hurried , wistful dog with a warm doughnut in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 32]: The kitchen door slammed petulantly , enclosing the sore voice of Della , whereupon Penrod and Duke seated themselves upon the pleasant sward and immediately consumed the spoils of their raid .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 55]: From the cross-street which formed the side boundary of the Schofields ' ample yard came a jingle of harness and the cadenced clatter of a pair of trotting horses , and Penrod , looking up , beheld the passing of a fat acquaintance , torpid amid the conservative splendours of a rather old-fashioned victoria .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 44]: This was Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , a fellow sufferer at the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class , but otherwise not often a companion : a home-sheltered lad , tutored privately and preserved against the coarsening influences of rude comradeship and miscellaneous information .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 22]: Heavily overgrown in all physical dimensions , virtuous , and placid , this cloistered mutton was wholly uninteresting to Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 42]: Nevertheless , Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , was a personage on account of the importance of the Magsworth Bitts family ; and it was Penrod 's destiny to increase Roderick 's celebrity far , far beyond its present aristocratic limitations .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 16]: The Magsworth Bittses were important because they were impressive ; there was no other reason .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 10]: And they were impressive because they believed themselves important .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 43]: The adults of the family were impregnably formal ; they dressed with reticent elegance , and wore the same nose and the same expression -- an expression which indicated that they knew something exquisite and sacred which other people could never know .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 26]: Other people , in their presence , were apt to feel mysteriously ignoble and to become secretly uneasy about ancestors , gloves , and pronunciation .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 28]: The Magsworth Bitts manner was withholding and reserved , though sometimes gracious , granting small smiles as great favours and giving off a chilling kind of preciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 44]: Naturally , when any citizen of the community did anything unconventional or improper , or made a mistake , or had a relative who went wrong , that citizen 's first and worst fear was that the Magsworth Bittses would hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 40]: In fact , this painful family had for years terrorized the community , though the community had never realized that it was terrorized , and invariably spoke of the family as the `` most charming circle in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 35]: By common consent , Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts officiated as the supreme model as well as critic-in-chief of morals and deportment for all the unlucky people prosperous enough to be elevated to her acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 9]: Magsworth was the important part of the name .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 65]: Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts was a Magsworth born , herself , and the Magsworth crest decorated not only Mrs. Magsworth Bitts ' note-paper but was on the china , on the table linen , on the chimney-pieces , on the opaque glass of the front door , on the victoria , and on the harness , though omitted from the garden-hose and the lawn-mower .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 55]: Naturally , no sensible person dreamed of connecting that illustrious crest with the unfortunate and notorious Rena Magsworth whose name had grown week by week into larger and larger type upon the front pages of newspapers , owing to the gradually increasing public and official belief that she had poisoned a family of eight .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 26]: However , the statement that no sensible person could have connected the Magsworth Bitts family with the arsenical Rena takes no account of Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 68]: Penrod never missed a murder , a hanging or an electrocution in the newspapers ; he knew almost as much about Rena Magsworth as her jurymen did , though they sat in a court-room two hundred miles away , and he had it in mind -- so frank he was -- to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , if the murderess happened to be a relative .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 17]: The present encounter , being merely one of apathetic greeting , did not afford the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 41]: Penrod took off his cap , and Roderick , seated between his mother and one of his grown-up sisters , nodded sluggishly , but neither Mrs. Magsworth Bitts nor her daughter acknowledged the salutation of the boy in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 17]: They disapproved of him as a person of little consequence , and that little , bad .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 11]: Snubbed , Penrod thoughtfully restored his cap to his head .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 21]: A boy can be cut as effectually as a man , and this one was chilled to a low temperature .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 32]: He wondered if they despised him because they had seen a last fragment of doughnut in his hand ; then he thought that perhaps it was Duke who had disgraced him .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: Duke was certainly no fashionable looking dog .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 46]: The resilient spirits of youth , however , presently revived , and discovering a spider upon one knee and a beetle simultaneously upon the other , Penrod forgot Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts in the course of some experiments infringing upon the domain of Doctor Carrel .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 38]: Penrod 's efforts -- with the aid of a pin -- to effect a transference of living organism were unsuccessful ; but he convinced himself forever that a spider can not walk with a beetle 's legs .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 27]: Della then enhanced zoological interest by depositing upon the back porch a large rat-trap from the cellar , the prison of four live rats awaiting execution .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 39]: Penrod at once took possession , retiring to the empty stable , where he installed the rats in a small wooden box with a sheet of broken window-glass -- held down by a brickbat -- over the top .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 22]: Thus the symptoms of their agitation , when the box was shaken or hammered upon , could be studied at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 7]: Altogether this Saturday was starting splendidly .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 43]: After a time , the student 's attention was withdrawn from his specimens by a peculiar smell , which , being followed up by a system of selective sniffing , proved to be an emanation leaking into the stable from the alley .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 6]: He opened the back door .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 71]: Across the alley was a cottage which a thrifty neighbour had built on the rear line of his lot and rented to negroes ; and the fact that a negro family was now in process of `` moving in '' was manifested by the presence of a thin mule and a ramshackle wagon , the latter laden with the semblance of a stove and a few other unpretentious household articles .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 10]: A very small darky boy stood near the mule .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 33]: In his hand was a rusty chain , and at the end of the chain the delighted Penrod perceived the source of the special smell he was tracing -- a large raccoon .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 28]: Duke , who had shown not the slightest interest in the rats , set up a frantic barking and simulated a ravening assault upon the strange animal .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 55]: It was only a bit of acting , however , for Duke was an old dog , had suffered much , and desired no unnecessary sorrow , wherefore he confined his demonstrations to alarums and excursions , and presently sat down at a distance and expressed himself by intermittent threatenings in a quavering falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 10]: `` What 's that ` coon 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 7]: asked Penrod , intending no discourtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 11]: `` Aim gommo mame , '' said the small darky .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 6]: `` Aim gommo mame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 4]: `` WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 6]: The small darky looked annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 14]: `` Aim GOMMO mame , I hell you , '' he said impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 7]: Penrod conceived that insult was intended .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 4]: he demanded advancing .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 19]: `` You get fresh with ME , and I 'll -- '' `` Hyuh , white boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 16]: A coloured youth of Penrod 's own age appeared in the doorway of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: `` You let ` at brothuh mine alone .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 10]: He ain ' do nothin ' to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 10]: `` Well , why ca n't he answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 5]: `` He ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 13]: He ca n't talk no better 'n what he WAS talkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 5]: He tongue-tie ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 9]: `` Oh , '' said Penrod , mollified .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 29]: Then , obeying an impulse so universally aroused in the human breast under like circumstances that it has become a quip , he turned to the afflicted one .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: `` Talk some more , '' he begged eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 23]: `` I hoe you ackoom aim gommo mame , '' was the prompt response , in which a slight ostentation was manifest .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 13]: Unmistakable tokens of vanity had appeared upon the small , swart countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 7]: `` What 's he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 5]: asked Penrod , enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 17]: `` He say he tole you ` at ` coon ain ' got no name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 7]: `` What 's YOUR name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: `` I 'm name Herman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: `` What 's his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 7]: Penrod pointed to the tongue-tied boy .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 4]: `` Verman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 3]: `` Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 10]: Was three us boys in ow fam ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 6]: Ol' est one name Sherman .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 9]: 'N' en come me ; I 'm Herman .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 8]: 'N' en come him ; he Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 3]: Sherman dead .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 9]: Verman , he de littles ' one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 9]: `` You goin ' to live here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 3]: `` Umhuh .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 12]: Done move in f 'm way outen on a fahm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 22]: He pointed to the north with his right hand , and Penrod 's eyes opened wide as they followed the gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 8]: Herman had no forefinger on that hand .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 5]: `` Look there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 3]: exclaimed Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: `` You have n't got any finger ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 14]: _ I _ mum map , '' said Verman , with egregious pride .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 12]: `` HE done ` at , '' interpreted Herman , chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 14]: `` Yessuh ; done chop ` er spang off , long ` go .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 34]: He 's a playin ' wif a ax an ' I lay my finguh on de do ' - sill an ' I say , ` Verman , chop ` er off ! '
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 14]: So Verman he chop ` er right spang off up to de roots !
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 3]: Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 5]: `` What FOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 9]: `` Jes ' fo ' nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 10]: `` He hoe me hoo , '' remarked Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 41]: `` Yessuh , I tole him to , '' said Herman , `` an ' he chop ` er off , an ' ey ai n't airy oth ' one evuh grown on wheres de ole one use to grow .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 3]: Nosuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 13]: `` But what 'd you tell him to do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 20]: I ` es ' said it ` at way -- an ' he jes ' chop er off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 7]: Both brothers looked pleased and proud .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 14]: Penrod 's profound interest was flatteringly visible , a tribute to their unusualness .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 10]: `` Hem bow goy , '' suggested Verman eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 9]: `` Aw ri ' , '' said Herman .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 16]: `` Ow sistuh Queenie , she a growed-up woman ; she got a goituh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 6]: `` Got a what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 3]: `` Goituh .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 12]: Swellin ' on her neck -- grea ' big swellin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 8]: She heppin ' mammy move in now .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 19]: You look in de front-room winduh wheres she sweepin ' ; you kin see it on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 17]: Penrod looked in the window and was rewarded by a fine view of Queenie 's goitre .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 25]: He had never before seen one , and only the lure of further conversation on the part of Verman brought him from the window .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 13]: `` Verman say tell you ` bout pappy , '' explained Herman .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 24]: `` Mammy an ' Queenie move in town an ' go git de house all fix up befo ' pappy git out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 6]: `` Out of where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 3]: `` Jail .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 36]: Pappy cut a man , an ' de police done kep ' him in jail evuh sense Chris ` mus-time ; but dey goin ' tuhn him loose ag ` in nex ' week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 11]: `` What 'd he cut the other man with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 6]: `` Wif a pitchfawk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 17]: Penrod began to feel that a lifetime spent with this fascinating family were all too short .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 13]: The brothers , glowing with amiability , were as enraptured as he .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 16]: For the first time in their lives they moved in the rich glamour of sensationalism .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 24]: Herman was prodigal of gesture with his right hand ; and Verman , chuckling with delight , talked fluently , though somewhat consciously .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 89]: They cheerfully agreed to keep the raccoon -- already beginning to be mentioned as `` our ` coon '' by Penrod -- in Mr. Schofield 's empty stable , and , when the animal had been chained to the wall near the box of rats and supplied with a pan of fair water , they assented to their new friend 's suggestion -LRB- inspired by a fine sense of the artistic harmonies -RRB- that the heretofore nameless pet be christened Sherman , in honour of their deceased relative .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 29]: At this juncture was heard from the front yard the sound of that yodelling which is the peculiar accomplishment of those whose voices have not `` changed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 18]: Penrod yodelled a response ; and Mr. Samuel Williams appeared , a large bundle under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 6]: `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 23]: was his greeting , casual enough from without ; but , having entered , he stopped short and emitted a prodigious whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 4]: `` YA-A-AY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 4]: he then shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 8]: `` Look at the ` coon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 16]: `` I guess you better say , ` Look at the ` coon ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 4]: Penrod returned proudly .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 15]: `` They 's a good deal more 'n him to look at , too .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 6]: Talk some , Verman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 3]: Verman complied .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 5]: Sam was warmly interested .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 10]: `` What 'd you say his name was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: `` Verman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 7]: `` How d'you spell it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 15]: `` V-e-r-m-a-n , '' replied Penrod , having previously received this information from Herman .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 25]: `` Point to sumpthing , Herman , '' Penrod commanded , and Sam 's excitement , when Herman pointed was sufficient to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 22]: Penrod , the discoverer , continued his exploitation of the manifold wonders of the Sherman , Herman , and Verman collection .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 48]: With the air of a proprietor he escorted Sam into the alley for a good look at Queenie -LRB- who seemed not to care for her increasing celebrity -RRB- and proceeded to a dramatic climax -- the recital of the episode of the pitchfork and its consequences .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 14]: The cumulative effect was enormous , and could have but one possible result .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 11]: The normal boy is always at least one half Barnum .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 9]: `` Let 's get up a SHOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 22]: Penrod and Sam both claimed to have said it first , a question left unsettled in the ecstasies of hurried preparation .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 20]: The bundle under Sam 's arm , brought with no definite purpose , proved to have been an inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 20]: It consisted of broad sheets of light yellow wrapping-paper , discarded by Sam 's mother in her spring house-cleaning .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 35]: There were half-filled cans and buckets of paint in the storeroom adjoining the carriage-house , and presently the side wall of the stable flamed information upon the passer-by from a great and spreading poster .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 29]: `` Publicity , '' primal requisite of all theatrical and amphitheatrical enterprise thus provided , subsequent arrangements proceeded with a fury of energy which transformed the empty hayloft .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 27]: True , it is impossible to say just what the hay-loft was transformed into , but history warrantably clings to the statement that it was transformed .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 47]: Duke and Sherman were secured to the rear wall at a considerable distance from each other , after an exhibition of reluctance on the part of Duke , during which he displayed a nervous energy and agility almost miraculous in so small and middle-aged a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 63]: Benches were improvised for spectators ; the rats were brought up ; finally the rafters , corn-crib , and hay-chute were ornamented with flags and strips of bunting from Sam Williams ' attic , Sam returning from the excursion wearing an old silk hat , and accompanied -LRB- on account of a rope -RRB- by a fine dachshund encountered on the highway .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 64]: In the matter of personal decoration paint was generously used : an interpretation of the spiral , inclining to whites and greens , becoming brilliantly effective upon the dark facial backgrounds of Herman and Verman ; while the countenances of Sam and Penrod were each supplied with the black moustache and imperial , lacking which , no professional showman can be esteemed conscientious .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 34]: It was regretfully decided , in council , that no attempt be made to add Queenie to the list of exhibits , her brothers warmly declining to act as ambassadors in that cause .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 34]: They were certain Queenie would not like the idea , they said , and Herman picturesquely described her activity on occasions when she had been annoyed by too much attention to her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 38]: However , Penrod 's disappointment was alleviated by an inspiration which came to him in a moment of pondering upon the dachshund , and the entire party went forth to add an enriching line to the poster .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 23]: They found a group of seven , including two adults , already gathered in the street to read and admire this work .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 58]: SCHoFiELD & WiLLiAMS BiG SHOW ADMiSSioN 1 CENT oR 20 PiNS MUSUEM oF CURioSiTES Now GoiNG oN SHERMAN HERMAN & VERMAN THiER FATHERS iN JAiL STABED A MAN WiTH A PiTCHFORK SHERMAN THE WiLD ANIMAL CAPTURED iN AFRiCA HERMAN THE ONE FiNGERED TATOOD WILD MAN VERMAN THE SAVAGE TATOOD WILD BoY TALKS ONLY iN HiS NAiTiVE LANGUAGS .

Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 36]: CHAPTER XVI THE NEW STAR Sam , Penrod , Herman , and Verman withdrew in considerable state from non-paying view , and , repairing to the hay-loft , declared the exhibition open to the public .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 40]: Oral proclamation was made by Sam , and then the loitering multitude was enticed by the seductive strains of a band ; the two partners performing upon combs and paper , Herman and Verman upon tin pans with sticks .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: The effect was immediate .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 9]: Visitors appeared upon the stairway and sought admission .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 43]: Herman and Verman took position among the exhibits , near the wall ; Sam stood at the entrance , officiating as barker and ticket-seller ; while Penrod , with debonair suavity , acted as curator , master of ceremonies , and lecturer .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 11]: He greeted the first to enter with a courtly bow .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 19]: They consisted of Miss Rennsdale and her nursery governess , and they paid spot cash for their admission .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 26]: `` Walk in , lay-deeze , walk right in -- pray do not obstruck the passageway , '' said Penrod , in a remarkable voice .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 14]: `` Pray be seated ; there is room for each and all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 51]: Miss Rennsdale and governess were followed by Mr. Georgie Bassett and baby sister -LRB- which proves the perfection of Georgie 's character -RRB- and six or seven other neighbourhood children -- a most satisfactory audience , although , subsequent to Miss Rennsdale and governess , admission was wholly by pin .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 27]: `` GEN-til-mun and LAY-deeze , '' shouted Penrod , `` I will first call your at-tain-shon to our genuine South American dog , part alligator ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 20]: He pointed to the dachshund , and added , in his ordinary tone , `` That 's him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 32]: Straightway reassuming the character of showman , he bellowed : `` NEXT , you see Duke , the genuine , full-blooded Indian dog from the far Western Plains and Rocky Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 34]: NEXT , the trained Michigan rats , captured way up there , and trained to jump and run all around the box at the -- at the -- at the slightest PRE-text ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 23]: He paused , partly to take breath and partly to enjoy his own surprised discovery that this phrase was in his vocabulary .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 7]: `` At the slightest PRE-text ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 38]: he repeated , and continued , suiting the action to the word : `` I will now hammer upon the box and each and all may see these genuine full-blooded Michigan rats perform at the slightest PRE-text !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 25]: -LRB- That 's all they do now , but I and Sam are goin ' to train 'em lots more before this afternoon . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 32]: GEN-til-mun and LAY-deeze I will kindly now call your at-tain-shon to Sherman , the wild animal from Africa , costing the lives of the wild trapper and many of his companions .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: NEXT , let me kindly interodoos Herman and Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 31]: Their father got mad and stuck his pitchfork right inside of another man , exactly as promised upon the advertisements outside the big tent , and got put in jail .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 38]: Look at them well , gen-til-mun and lay-deeze , there is no extra charge , and RE-MEM-BUR you are each and all now looking at two wild , tattooed men which the father of is in jail .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 4]: Point , Herman .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 10]: Each and all will have a chance to see .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: Point to sumpthing else , Herman .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 10]: This is the only genuine one-fingered tattooed wild man .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 29]: Last on the programme , gen-til-mun and lay-deeze , we have Verman , the savage tattooed wild boy , that ca n't speak only his native foreign languages .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 6]: Talk some , Verman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 8]: Verman obliged and made an instantaneous hit .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 35]: He was encored rapturously , again and again ; and , thrilling with the unique pleasure of being appreciated and misunderstood at the same time , would have talked all day but too gladly .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 23]: Sam Williams , however , with a true showman 's foresight , whispered to Penrod , who rang down on the monologue .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 10]: `` GEN-til-mun and LAY-deeze , this closes our pufformance .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 12]: Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 32]: As soon as you are all out there 's goin ' to be a new pufformance , and each and all are welcome at the same and simple price of admission .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 12]: Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 24]: RE-MEM-BUR the price is only one cent , the tenth part of a dime , or twenty pins , no bent ones taken .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 12]: Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 27]: The Schofield and Williams Military Band will play before each pufformance , and each and all are welcome for the same and simple price of admission .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 13]: Pray pass out quietly and with as little jostling as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 69]: Forthwith , the Schofield and Williams Military Band began a second overture , in which something vaguely like a tune was at times distinguishable ; and all of the first audience returned , most of them having occupied the interval in hasty excursions for more pins ; Miss Rennsdale and governess , however , again paying coin of the Republic and receiving deference and the best seats accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 65]: And when a third performance found all of the same inveterate patrons once more crowding the auditorium , and seven recruits added , the pleasurable excitement of the partners in their venture will be understood by any one who has seen a metropolitan manager strolling about the foyer of his theatre some evening during the earlier stages of an assured `` phenomenal run . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 40]: From the first , there was no question which feature of the entertainment was the attraction extraordinary : Verman -- Verman , the savage tattooed wild boy , speaking only his native foreign languages -- Verman was a triumph !
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 27]: Beaming , wreathed in smiles , melodious , incredibly fluent , he had but to open his lips and a dead hush fell upon the audience .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 33]: Breathless , they leaned forward , hanging upon his every semi-syllable , and , when Penrod checked the flow , burst into thunders of applause , which Verman received with happy laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 31]: he delayed not o'er long to display all the egregiousness of a new star ; but for a time there was no caprice of his too eccentric to be forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 43]: During Penrod 's lecture upon the other curios , the tattooed wild boy continually stamped his foot , grinned , and gesticulated , tapping his tiny chest , and pointing to himself as it were to say : `` Wait for Me !
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 7]: I am the Big Show . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 10]: So soon they learn ; so soon they learn !
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 6]: And -LRB- again alas ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 26]: this spoiled darling of public favour , like many another , was fated to know , in good time , the fickleness of that favour .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 17]: But during all the morning performances he was the idol of his audience and looked it !
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 49]: The climax of his popularity came during the fifth overture of the Schofield and Williams Military Band , when the music was quite drowned in the agitated clamours of Miss Rennsdale , who was endeavouring to ascend the stairs in spite of the physical dissuasion of her governess .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 10]: `` I WO N'T go home to lunch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 13]: screamed Miss Rennsdale , her voice accompanied by a sound of ripping .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 12]: `` I WILL hear the tattooed wild boy talk some more !
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 10]: It 's lovely -- I WILL hear him talk !
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 3]: I WILL !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: I WILL !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 43]: I want to listen to Verman -- I WANT to -- I WANT to -- '' Wailing , she was borne away -- of her sex not the first to be fascinated by obscurity , nor the last to champion its eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 50]: Verman was almost unendurable after this , but , like many , many other managers , Schofield and Williams restrained their choler , and even laughed fulsomely when their principal attraction essayed the role of a comedian in private , and capered and squawked in sheer , fatuous vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 68]: The first performance of the afternoon rivalled the successes of the morning , and although Miss Rennsdale was detained at home , thus drying up the single source of cash income developed before lunch , Maurice Levy appeared , escorting Marjorie Jones , and paid coin for two admissions , dropping the money into Sam 's hand with a careless -- nay , a contemptuous -- gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 26]: At sight of Marjorie , Penrod Schofield flushed under his new moustache -LRB- repainted since noon -RRB- and lectured as he had never lectured before .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 33]: A new grace invested his every gesture ; a new sonorousness rang in his voice ; a simple and manly pomposity marked his very walk as he passed from curio to curio .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 46]: And when he fearlessly handled the box of rats and hammered upon it with cool insouciance , he beheld -- for the first time in his life -- a purl of admiration eddying in Marjorie 's lovely eye , a certain softening of that eye .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: And then Verman spake and Penrod was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 9]: Marjorie 's eye rested upon him no more .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 21]: A heavily equipped chauffeur ascended the stairway , bearing the message that Mrs. Levy awaited her son and his lady .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 53]: Thereupon , having devoured the last sound permitted -LRB- by the managers -RRB- to issue from Verman , Mr. Levy and Miss Jones departed to a real matinee at a real theatre , the limpid eyes of Marjorie looking back softly over her shoulder -- but only at the tattooed wild boy .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 12]: Nearly always it is woman who puts the irony into life .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 23]: After this , perhaps because of sated curiosity , perhaps on account of a pin famine , the attendance began to languish .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 34]: Only four responded to the next call of the band ; the four dwindled to three ; finally the entertainment was given for one blase auditor , and Schofield and Williams looked depressed .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: Then followed an interval when the band played in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 35]: About three o'clock Schofield and Williams were gloomily discussing various unpromising devices for startling the public into a renewal of interest , when another patron unexpectedly appeared and paid a cent for his admission .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 58]: News of the Big Show and Museum of Curiosities had at last penetrated the far , cold spaces of interstellar niceness , for this new patron consisted of no less than Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , escaped in a white `` sailor suit '' from the Manor during a period of severe maternal and tutorial preoccupation .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 18]: He seated himself without parley , and the pufformance was offered for his entertainment with admirable conscientiousness .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 58]: True to the Lady Clara caste and training , Roderick 's pale , fat face expressed nothing except an impervious superiority and , as he sat , cold and unimpressed upon the front bench , like a large , white lump , it must be said that he made a discouraging audience `` to play to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 12]: He was not , however , unresponsive -- far from it .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 13]: He offered comment very chilling to the warm grandiloquence of the orator .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 20]: `` That 's my uncle Ethelbert 's dachshund , '' he remarked , at the beginning of the lecture .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 16]: `` You better take him back if you do n't want to get arrested . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 38]: And when Penrod , rather uneasily ignoring the interruption , proceeded to the exploitation of the genuine , full-blooded Indian dog , Duke , `` Why do n't you try to give that old dog away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 3]: asked Roderick .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 8]: `` You could n't sell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 35]: `` My papa would buy me a lots better ` coon than that , '' was the information volunteered a little later , `` only I would n't want the nasty old thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 10]: Herman of the missing finger obtained no greater indulgence .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 3]: said Roderick .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 23]: `` We have two fox-terriers in our stables that took prizes at the kennel show , and their tails were BIT off .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: There 's a man that always bites fox-terriers ' tails off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 11]: `` Oh , my gosh , what a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 5]: exclaimed Sam Williams ignorantly .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 15]: `` Go on with the show whether he likes it or not , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 7]: He 's paid his money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 42]: Verman , confident in his own singular powers , chuckled openly at the failure of the other attractions to charm the frosty visitor , and , when his turn came , poured forth a torrent of conversation which was straightway damned .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 9]: `` Rotten , '' said Mr. Bitts languidly .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 7]: `` Anybody could talk like that .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 12]: _ I _ could do it if I wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 4]: Verman paused suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 7]: `` YES , you could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 5]: exclaimed Penrod , stung .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 11]: `` Let 's hear you do it , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 4]: `` Yessir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 5]: the other partner shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 10]: `` Let 's just hear you DO it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 14]: `` I said I could if I wanted to , '' responded Roderick .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 9]: `` I did n't say I WOULD . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 3]: `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 6]: Knows he ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 3]: sneered Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 11]: `` I can , too , if I try . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 10]: `` Well , let 's hear you try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 40]: So challenged , the visitor did try , but , in the absence of an impartial jury , his effort was considered so pronounced a failure that he was howled down , derided , and mocked with great clamours .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 34]: `` Anyway , '' said Roderick , when things had quieted down , `` if I could n't get up a better show than this I 'd sell out and leave town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 24]: Not having enough presence of mind to inquire what he would sell out , his adversaries replied with mere formless yells of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 19]: `` I could get up a better show than this with my left hand , '' Roderick asserted .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 13]: `` Well , what would you have in your ole show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 7]: asked Penrod , condescending to language .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 11]: `` That 's all right , what I 'd HAVE .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 6]: I 'd have enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 14]: `` You could n't get Herman and Verman in your ole show . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: `` No , and I would n't want 'em , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 9]: `` Well , what WOULD you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 4]: insisted Penrod derisively .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 17]: `` You 'd have to have SUMPTHING -- you could n't be a show yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 7]: `` How do YOU know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 14]: This was but meandering while waiting for ideas , and evoked another yell .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 13]: `` You think you could be a show all by yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 3]: demanded Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: `` How do YOU know I could n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 14]: Two white boys and two black boys shrieked their scorn of the boaster .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 7]: `` I could , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 13]: Roderick raised his voice to a sudden howl , obtaining a hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 12]: `` Well , why do n't you tell us how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 16]: `` Well , _ I _ know HOW , all right , '' said Roderick .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 19]: `` If anybody asks you , you can just tell him I know HOW , all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 14]: `` Why , you ca n't DO anything , '' Sam began argumentatively .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 18]: `` You talk about being a show all by yourself ; what could you try to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 8]: Show us sumpthing you can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 21]: `` I did n't say I was going to DO anything , '' returned the badgered one , still evading .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 13]: `` Well , then , how 'd you BE a show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 3]: Penrod demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 19]: `` WE got a show here , even if Herman did n't point or Verman did n't talk .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 17]: Their father stabbed a man with a pitchfork , I guess , did n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 9]: `` How do _ I _ know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 15]: `` Well , I guess he 's in jail , ai n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 11]: `` Well , what if their father is in jail ?
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 12]: I did n't say he was n't , did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 14]: `` Well , YOUR father ai n't in jail , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 13]: `` Well , I never said he was , did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 37]: `` Well , then , '' continued Penrod , `` how could you be a -- '' He stopped abruptly , staring at Roderick , the birth of an idea plainly visible in his altered expression .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 50]: He had suddenly remembered his intention to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , about Rena Magsworth , and this recollection collided in his mind with the irritation produced by Roderick 's claiming some mysterious attainment which would warrant his setting up as a show in his single person .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 7]: Penrod 's whole manner changed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 30]: `` Roddy , '' he asked , almost overwhelmed by a prescience of something vast and magnificent , `` Roddy , are you any relation of Rena Magsworth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 35]: Roderick had never heard of Rena Magsworth , although a concentration of the sentence yesterday pronounced upon her had burned , black and horrific , upon the face of every newspaper in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 31]: He was not allowed to read the journals of the day and his family 's indignation over the sacrilegious coincidence of the name had not been expressed in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 16]: But he saw that it was an awesome name to Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 39]: Even Herman and Verman , though lacking many educational advantages on account of a long residence in the country , were informed on the subject of Rena Magsworth through hearsay , and they joined in the portentous silence .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 19]: `` Roddy , '' repeated Penrod , `` honest , is Rena Magsworth some relation of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 28]: There is no obsession more dangerous to its victims than a conviction especially an inherited one -- of superiority : this world is so full of Missourians .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 24]: And from his earliest years Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , had been trained to believe in the importance of the Magsworth family .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 33]: At every meal he absorbed a sense of Magsworth greatness , and yet , in his infrequent meetings with persons of his own age and sex , he was treated as negligible .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 23]: Now , dimly , he perceived that there was a Magsworth claim of some sort which was impressive , even to boys .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 16]: Magsworth blood was the essential of all true distinction in the world , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 34]: Consequently , having been driven into a cul-de-sac , as a result of flagrant and unfounded boasting , he was ready to take advantage of what appeared to be a triumphal way out .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 21]: `` Roddy , '' said Penrod again , with solemnity , `` is Rena Magsworth some relation of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 7]: `` IS she , Roddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 6]: asked Sam , almost hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 7]: `` She 's my aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 3]: shouted Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 3]: Silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 14]: Sam and Penrod , spellbound , gazed upon Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 6]: So did Herman and Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 12]: Roddy 's staggering lie had changed the face of things utterly .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 18]: No one questioned it ; no one realized that it was much too good to be true .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 24]: `` Roddy , '' said Penrod , in a voice tremulous with hope , `` Roddy , will you join our show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 3]: Roddy joined .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 22]: Even he could see that the offer implied his being starred as the paramount attraction of a new order of things .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 35]: It was obvious that he had swelled out suddenly , in the estimation of the other boys , to that importance which he had been taught to believe his native gift and natural right .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 5]: The sensation was pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 67]: He had often been treated with effusion by grown-up callers and by acquaintances of his mothers and sisters ; he had heard ladies speak of him as `` charming '' and `` that delightful child , '' and little girls had sometimes shown him deference , but until this moment no boy had ever allowed him , for one moment , to presume even to equality .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 28]: Now , in a trice , he was not only admitted to comradeship , but patently valued as something rare and sacred to be acclaimed and pedestalled .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 23]: In fact , the very first thing that Schofield and Williams did was to find a box for him to stand upon .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 28]: The misgivings roused in Roderick 's bosom by the subsequent activities of the firm were not bothersome enough to make him forego his prominence as Exhibit A .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 29]: He was not a `` quick-minded '' boy , and it was long -LRB- and much happened -RRB- before he thoroughly comprehended the causes of his new celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 41]: He had a shadowy feeling that if the affair came to be heard of at home it might not be liked , but , intoxicated by the glamour and bustle which surround a public character , he made no protest .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 15]: On the contrary , he entered whole-heartedly into the preparations for the new show .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 53]: Assuming , with Sam 's assistance , a blue moustache and `` side-burns , '' he helped in the painting of a new poster , which , supplanting the old one on the wall of the stable facing the cross-street , screamed bloody murder at the passers in that rather populous thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 144]: SCHoFiELD & WiLLiAMS NEW BIG SHoW RoDERiCK MAGSWoRTH BiTTS JR ONLY LiViNG NEPHEW oF RENA MAGSWORTH THE FAMOS MUDERESS GoiNG To BE HUNG NEXT JULY KiLED EiGHT PEOPLE PUT ARSiNECK iN THiER MiLK ALSO SHERMAN HERMAN AND VERMAN THE MiCHiGAN RATS DOG PART ALLiGATOR DUKE THE GENUiNE InDiAN DoG ADMISSioN 1 CENT oR 20 PINS SAME AS BEFORE Do NoT MISS THIS CHANSE TO SEE RoDERICK ONLY LiViNG NEPHEW oF RENA MAGSWORTH THE GREAT FAMOS MUDERESS GoiNG To BE HUNG CHAPTER XVII RETIRING FROM THE SHOW-BUSINESS Megaphones were constructed out of heavy wrapping-paper , and Penrod , Sam , and Herman set out in different directions , delivering vocally the inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large section of the residential quarter , and leaving Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , with Verman in the loft , shielded from all deadhead eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 31]: Upon the return of the heralds , the Schofield and Williams Military Band played deafeningly , and an awakened public once more thronged to fill the coffers of the firm .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 4]: Prosperity smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 18]: The very first audience after the acquisition of Roderick was larger than the largest of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 15]: Master Bitts -- the only exhibit placed upon a box -- was a supercurio .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 17]: All eyes fastened upon him and remained , hungrily feasting , throughout Penrod 's luminous oration .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 14]: But the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 15]: We dwell in a vale of seesaws -- and cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 50]: Verman , the tattooed wild boy , speaking only in his native foreign languages , Verman the gay , Verman the caperer , capered no more ; he chuckled no more , he beckoned no more , nor tapped his chest , nor wreathed his idolatrous face in smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 31]: Gone , all gone , were his little artifices for attracting the general attention to himself ; gone was every engaging mannerism which had endeared him to the mercurial public .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 12]: He squatted against the wall and glowered at the new sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 23]: It was the old story -- the old , old story of too much temperament : Verman was suffering from artistic jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 19]: The second audience contained a cash-paying adult , a spectacled young man whose poignant attention was very flattering .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 24]: He remained after the lecture , and put a few questions to Roddy , which were answered rather confusedly upon promptings from Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 25]: The young man went away without having stated the object of his interrogations , but it became quite plain , later in the day .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 35]: This same object caused the spectacled young man to make several brief but stimulating calls directly after leaving the Schofield and Williams Big Show , and the consequences thereof loitered not by the wayside .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 8]: The Big Show was at high tide .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 29]: Not only was the auditorium filled and throbbing ; there was an indubitable line -- by no means wholly juvenile -- waiting for admission to the next pufformance .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 48]: A group stood in the street examining the poster earnestly as it glowed in the long , slanting rays of the westward sun , and people in automobiles and other vehicles had halted wheel in the street to read the message so piquantly given to the world .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 36]: These were the conditions when a crested victoria arrived at a gallop , and a large , chastely magnificent and highly flushed woman descended , and progressed across the yard with an air of violence .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 26]: At sight of her , the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared , and most of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 10]: She was followed by a stricken man in livery .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 31]: The stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep ; Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts was of a stout favour ; and the voice of Penrod was audible during the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 30]: `` RE-MEM-BUR , gentilmun and lay-deeze , each and all are now gazing upon Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , the only living nephew of the great Rena Magsworth .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 27]: She stuck ars ` nic in the milk of eight separate and distinck people to put in their coffee and each and all of 'em died .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 22]: The great ars ` nic murderess , Rena Magsworth , gentilmun and lay-deeze , and Roddy 's her only living nephew .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 20]: She 's a relation of all the Bitts family , but he 's her one and only living nephew .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 2]: RE-MEM-BUR !
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 42]: Next July she 's goin ' to be hung , and , each and all , you now see before you -- '' Penrod paused abruptly , seeing something before himself -- the august and awful presence which filled the entryway .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 14]: And his words -LRB- it should be related -RRB- froze upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 50]: Before HERSELF , Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts saw her son -- her scion -- wearing a moustache and sideburns of blue , and perched upon a box flanked by Sherman and Verman , the Michigan rats , the Indian dog Duke , Herman , and the dog part alligator .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 9]: Roddy , also , saw something before himself .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 16]: It needed no prophet to read the countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 22]: His mouth opened -- remained open -- then filled to capacity with a calamitous sound of grief not unmingled with apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 8]: Penrod 's reason staggered under the crisis .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 18]: For a horrible moment he saw Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts approaching like some fatal mountain in avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 39]: She seemed to grow larger and redder ; lightnings played about her head ; he had a vague consciousness of the audience spraying out in flight , of the squealings , tramplings and dispersals of a stricken field .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 26]: The mountain was close upon him -- He stood by the open mouth of the hay-chute which went through the floor to the manger below .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 7]: Penrod also went through the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 35]: He propelled himself into the chute and shot down , but not quite to the manger , for Mr. Samuel Williams had thoughtfully stepped into the chute a moment in advance of his partner .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 5]: Penrod lit upon Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 15]: Catastrophic noises resounded in the loft ; volcanoes seemed to romp upon the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 22]: There ensued a period when only a shrill keening marked the passing of Roderick as he was borne to the tumbril .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 5]: Then all was silence .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 49]: ... Sunset , striking through a western window , rouged the walls of the Schofields ' library , where gathered a joint family council and court martial of four -- Mrs. Schofield , Mr. Schofield , and Mr. and Mrs. Williams , parents of Samuel of that ilk .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 29]: Mr. Williams read aloud a conspicuous passage from the last edition of the evening paper : `` Prominent people here believed close relations of woman sentenced to hang .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 8]: Angry denial by Mrs. R. Magsworth Bitts .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 8]: Relationship admitted by younger member of family .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 12]: His statement confirmed by boy-friends -- '' `` Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 9]: said Mrs. Williams , addressing her husband vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 10]: `` We 've all read it a dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 15]: We 've got plenty of trouble on our hands without hearing THAT again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 21]: Singularly enough , Mrs. Williams did not look troubled ; she looked as if she were trying to look troubled .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 7]: Mrs. Schofield wore a similar expression .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 5]: So did Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: So did Mr. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 12]: `` What did she say when she called YOU up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 8]: Mrs. Schofield inquired breathlessly of Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 51]: `` She could hardly speak at first , and then when she did talk , she talked so fast I could n't understand most of it , and -- '' `` It was just the same when she tried to talk to me , '' said Mrs. Schofield , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 18]: `` I never did hear any one in such a state before , '' continued Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 17]: `` So furious -- '' `` Quite justly , of course , '' said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 66]: And she said Penrod and Sam had enticed Roderick away from home -- usually he 's not allowed to go outside the yard except with his tutor or a servant -- and had told him to say that horrible creature was his aunt -- '' `` How in the world do you suppose Sam and Penrod ever thought of such a thing as THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 14]: `` It must have been made up just for their ` show . '
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 13]: Della says there were just STREAMS going in and out all day .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 48]: Of course it would n't have happened , but this was the day Margaret and I spend every month in the country with Aunt Sarah , and I did n't DREAM -- '' `` She said one thing I thought rather tactless , '' interrupted Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 37]: `` Of course we must allow for her being dreadfully excited and wrought up , but I do think it was n't quite delicate in her , and she 's usually the very soul of delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 27]: She said that Roderick had NEVER been allowed to associate with -- common boys -- '' `` Meaning Sam and Penrod , '' said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 12]: `` Yes , she said that to me , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 55]: `` She said that the most awful thing about it , '' Mrs. Williams went on , `` was that , though she 's going to prosecute the newspapers , many people would always believe the story , and -- '' `` Yes , I imagine they will , '' said Mrs. Schofield musingly .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 46]: `` Of course you and I and everybody who really knows the Bitts and Magsworth families understand the perfect absurdity of it ; but I suppose there are ever so many who 'll believe it , no matter what the Bittses and Magsworths say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 6]: `` Hundreds and hundreds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 4]: said Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 14]: `` I 'm afraid it will be a great come-down for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid so , '' said Mrs. Schofield gently .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 16]: `` A very great one -- yes , a very , very great one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 35]: `` Well , '' observed Mrs. Williams , after a thoughtful pause , `` there 's only one thing to be done , and I suppose it had better be done right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 7]: She glanced toward the two gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 8]: `` Certainly , '' Mr. Schofield agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 7]: `` But where ARE they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 9]: `` Have you looked in the stable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 4]: asked his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 5]: `` I searched it .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 10]: They 've probably started for the far West . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 9]: `` Did you look in the sawdust-box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 8]: `` No , I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 9]: `` Then that 's where they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 26]: Thus , in the early twilight , the now historic stable was approached by two fathers charged to do the only thing to be done .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 5]: They entered the storeroom .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: said Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 4]: `` Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 4]: said Mr. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 6]: Nothing disturbed the twilight hush .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 22]: But by means of a ladder , brought from the carriage-house , Mr. Schofield mounted to the top of the sawdust-box .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 23]: He looked within , and discerned the dim outlines of three quiet figures , the third being that of a small dog .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 38]: The two boys rose , upon command , descended the ladder after Mr. Schofield , bringing Duke with them , and stood before the authors of their being , who bent upon them sinister and threatening brows .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 23]: With hanging heads and despondent countenances , each still ornamented with a moustache and an imperial , Penrod and Sam awaited sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 28]: This is a boy 's lot : anything he does , anything whatever , may afterward turn out to have been a crime -- he never knows .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 8]: And punishment and clemency are alike inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 9]: Mr. Williams took his son by the ear .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 6]: `` You march home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 3]: he commanded .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 16]: Sam marched , not looking back , and his father followed the small figure implacably .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 9]: `` You goin ' to whip me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 7]: quavered Penrod , alone with Justice .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 14]: `` Wash your face at that hydrant , '' said his father sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 30]: About fifteen minutes later , Penrod , hurriedly entering the corner drug store , two blocks distant , was astonished to perceive a familiar form at the soda counter .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 10]: `` Yay , Penrod , '' said Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: `` Want some sody ?
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 3]: Come on .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 6]: He did n't lick me .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 10]: He did n't do anything to me at all .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 7]: He gave me a quarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 9]: `` So 'd mine , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 14]: CHAPTER XVIII MUSIC Boyhood is the longest time in life for a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 26]: The last term of the school-year is made of decades , not of weeks , and living through them is like waiting for the millennium .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 58]: But they do pass , somehow , and at last there came a day when Penrod was one of a group that capered out from the gravelled yard of `` Ward School , Nomber Seventh , '' carolling a leave-taking of the institution , of their instructress , and not even forgetting Mr. Capps , the janitor .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 5]: `` Good-bye , teacher !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 4]: Good-bye , school !
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 9]: Good-bye , Cappsie , dern ole fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: Penrod sang the loudest .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 16]: For every boy , there is an age when he `` finds his voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 14]: Penrod 's had not `` changed , '' but he had found it .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 44]: Inevitably that thing had come upon his family and the neighbours ; and his father , a somewhat dyspeptic man , quoted frequently the expressive words of the `` Lady of Shalott , '' but there were others whose sufferings were as poignant .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 29]: Vacation-time warmed the young of the world to pleasant languor ; and a morning came that was like a brightly coloured picture in a child 's fairy story .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 34]: Miss Margaret Schofield , reclining in a hammock upon the front porch , was beautiful in the eyes of a newly made senior , well favoured and in fair raiment , beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 34]: A guitar rested lightly upon his knee , and he was trying to play -- a matter of some difficulty , as the floor of the porch also seemed inclined to be musical .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 32]: From directly under his feet came a voice of song , shrill , loud , incredibly piercing and incredibly flat , dwelling upon each syllable with incomprehensible reluctance to leave it .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: `` I have lands and earthly pow-wur .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 35]: I 'd give all for a now-wur , Whi-ilst setting at MY-Y-Y dear old mother 's knee-ee , So-o-o rem-mem-bur whilst you 're young -- '' Miss Schofield stamped heartily upon the musical floor .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 9]: `` It 's Penrod , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 22]: `` The lattice at the end of the porch is loose , and he crawls under and comes out all bugs .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 22]: He 's been having a dreadful singing fit lately -- running away to picture shows and vaudeville , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 8]: Mr. Robert Williams looked upon her yearningly .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 12]: He touched a thrilling chord on his guitar and leaned nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 13]: `` But you said you have missed me , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: `` I -- '' The voice of Penrod drowned all other sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 39]: `` So-o-o rem-mem-bur , whi-i-ilst you 're young , That the day-a-ys to you will come , When you 're o-o-old and only in the way , Do not scoff at them BEE-cause -- '' `` PENROD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 5]: Miss Schofield stamped again .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 21]: `` You DID say you 'd missed me , '' said Mr. Robert Williams , seizing hurriedly upon the silence .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 13]: `` Did n't you say -- '' A livelier tune rose upward .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 40]: `` Oh , you talk about your fascinating beauties , Of your dem-O-zells , your belles , But the littil dame I met , while in the city , She 's par excellaws the queen of all the swells .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 32]: She 's sweeter far -- '' Margaret rose and jumped up and down repeatedly in a well-calculated area , whereupon the voice of Penrod cried chokedly , `` QUIT that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 8]: and there were subterranean coughings and sneezings .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: `` You want to choke a person to death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 18]: he inquired severely , appearing at the end of the porch , a cobweb upon his brow .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 28]: And , continuing , he put into practice a newly acquired phrase , `` You better learn to be more considerick of other people 's comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 30]: Slowly and grievedly he withdrew , passed to the sunny side of the house , reclined in the warm grass beside his wistful Duke , and presently sang again .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 24]: `` She 's sweeter far than the flower I named her after , And the memery of her smile it haunts me YET !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 29]: When in after years the moon is soffly beamun ' And at eve I smell the smell of mignonette I will re-CALL that -- '' `` Pen-ROD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 15]: Mr. Schofield appeared at an open window upstairs , a book in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 5]: `` Stop it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 3]: he commanded .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 28]: `` Ca n't I stay home with a headache ONE morning from the office without having to listen to -- I never DID hear such squawking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 14]: He retired from the window , having too impulsively called upon his Maker .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 24]: Penrod , shocked and injured , entered the house , but presently his voice was again audible as far as the front porch .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 13]: He was holding converse with his mother , somewhere in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 7]: `` Well , what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 40]: Sam Williams told me his mother said if Bob ever did think of getting married to Margaret , his mother said she 'd like to know what in the name o ' goodness they expect to -- '' Bang !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 10]: Margaret thought it better to close the front door .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 7]: The next minute Penrod opened it .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 18]: `` I suppose you want the whole family to get a sunstroke , '' he said reprovingly .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 19]: `` Keepin ' every breath of air out o ' the house on a day like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: And he sat down implacably in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 30]: The serious poetry of all languages has omitted the little brother ; and yet he is one of the great trials of love -- the immemorial burden of courtship .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 21]: Tragedy should have found place for him , but he has been left to the haphazard vignettist of Grub Street .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 21]: He is the grave and real menace of lovers ; his head is sacred and terrible , his power illimitable .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 29]: There is one way -- only one -- to deal with him ; but Robert Williams , having a brother of Penrod 's age , understood that way .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 8]: Robert had one dollar in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 7]: He gave it to Penrod immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 23]: Enslaved forever , the new Rockefeller rose and went forth upon the highway , an overflowing heart bursting the floodgates of song .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 19]: `` In her eyes the light of love was soffly gleamun ' , So sweetlay , So neatlay .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 22]: On the banks the moon 's soff light was brightly streamun ' , Words of love I then spoke TO her .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 23]: She was purest of the PEW-er : ` Littil sweetheart , do not sigh , Do not weep and do not cry .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 72]: I will build a littil cottige just for yew-EW-EW and I. ' '' In fairness , it must be called to mind that boys older than Penrod have these wellings of pent melody ; a wife can never tell when she is to undergo a musical morning , and even the golden wedding brings her no security , a man of ninety is liable to bust-loose in song , any time .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 28]: Invalids murmured pitifully as Penrod came within hearing ; and people trying to think cursed the day that they were born , when he went shrilling by .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 37]: His hands in his pockets , his shining face uplifted to the sky of June , he passed down the street , singing his way into the heart 's deepest hatred of all who heard him .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 25]: `` One evuning I was sturow-ling Midst the city of the DEAD , I viewed where all a-round me Their PEACE-full graves was SPREAD .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 63]: But that which touched me mostlay -- '' He had reached his journey 's end , a junk-dealer 's shop wherein lay the long-desired treasure of his soul -- an accordion which might have possessed a high quality of interest for an antiquarian , being unquestionably a ruin , beautiful in decay , and quite beyond the sacrilegious reach of the restorer .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 43]: But it was still able to disgorge sounds -- loud , strange , compelling sounds , which could be heard for a remarkable distance in all directions ; and it had one rich calf-like tone that had gone to Penrod 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 31]: He obtained the instrument for twenty-two cents , a price long since agreed upon with the junk-dealer , who falsely claimed a loss of profit , Shylock that he was !
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 9]: He had found the wreck in an alley .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 42]: With this purchase suspended from his shoulder by a faded green cord , Penrod set out in a somewhat homeward direction , but not by the route he had just travelled , though his motive for the change was not humanitarian .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: It was his desire to display himself thus troubadouring to the gaze of Marjorie Jones .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 27]: Heralding his advance by continuous experiments in the music of the future , he pranced upon his blithesome way , the faithful Duke at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 32]: -LRB- It was easier for Duke than it would have been for a younger dog , because , with advancing age , he had begun to grow a little deaf . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 48]: Turning the corner nearest to the glamoured mansion of the Joneses , the boy jongleur came suddenly face to face with Marjorie , and , in the delicious surprise of the encounter , ceased to play , his hands , in agitation , falling from the instrument .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 25]: Bareheaded , the sunshine glorious upon her amber curls , Marjorie was strolling hand-in-hand with her baby brother , Mitchell , four years old .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 24]: She wore pink that day -- unforgettable pink , with a broad , black patent-leather belt , shimmering reflections dancing upon its surface .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 5]: How beautiful she was !
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 24]: How sacred the sweet little baby brother , whose privilege it was to cling to that small hand , delicately powdered with freckles .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 12]: `` Hello , Marjorie , '' said Penrod , affecting carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 7]: said Marjorie , with unexpected cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 10]: She bent over her baby brother with motherly affectations .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 22]: `` Say ` howdy ' to the gentymuns , Mitchy-Mitch , '' she urged sweetly , turning him to face Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 5]: `` WO N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: said Mitchy-Mitch , and , to emphasize his refusal , kicked the gentymuns upon the shin .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 53]: Penrod 's feelings underwent instant change , and in the sole occupation of disliking Mitchy-Mitch , he wasted precious seconds which might have been better employed in philosophic consideration of the startling example , just afforded , of how a given law operates throughout the universe in precisely the same manner perpetually .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 10]: Mr. Robert Williams would have understood this , easily .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 6]: `` Oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: Marjorie cried , and put Mitchy-Mitch behind her with too much sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 26]: `` Maurice Levy 's gone to Atlantic City with his mamma , '' she remarked conversationally , as if the kicking incident were quite closed .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 17]: `` That 's nothin ' , '' returned Penrod , keeping his eye uneasily upon Mitchy-Mitch .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 16]: `` I know plenty people been better places than that -- Chicago and everywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 32]: There was unconscious ingratitude in his low rating of Atlantic City , for it was largely to the attractions of that resort he owed Miss Jones ' present attitude of friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 12]: Of course , too , she was curious about the accordion .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 41]: It would be dastardly to hint that she had noticed a paper bag which bulged the pocket of Penrod 's coat , and yet this bag was undeniably conspicuous -- `` and children are very like grown people sometimes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 34]: Penrod brought forth the bag , purchased on the way at a drug store , and till this moment UNOPENED , which expresses in a word the depth of his sentiment for Marjorie .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 24]: It contained an abundant fifteen-cents ' worth of lemon drops , jaw-breakers , licorice sticks , cinnamon drops , and shopworn choclate creams .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 14]: `` Take all you want , '' he said , with off-hand generosity .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 19]: `` Why , Penrod Schofield , '' exclaimed the wholly thawed damsel , `` you nice boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 13]: `` Oh , that 's nothin ' , '' he returned airily .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 12]: `` I got a good deal of money , nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 5]: `` Where from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 7]: `` Oh -- just around . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 23]: With a cautious gesture he offered a jaw-breaker to Mitchy-Mitch , who snatched it indignantly and set about its absorption without delay .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 8]: `` Can you play on that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 16]: asked Marjorie , with some difficulty , her cheeks being rather too hilly for conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 7]: `` Want to hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 9]: She nodded , her eyes sweet with anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 8]: This was what he had come for .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 39]: He threw back his head , lifted his eyes dreamily , as he had seen real musicians lift theirs , and distended the accordion preparing to produce the wonderful calf-like noise which was the instrument 's great charm .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 16]: But the distention evoked a long wail which was at once drowned in another one .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 2]: Owowaoh !
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 2]: Wowohah !
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 3]: WaowWOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: shrieked Mitchy-Mitch and the accordion together .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 27]: Mitchy-Mitch , to emphasize his disapproval of the accordion , opening his mouth still wider , lost therefrom the jaw-breaker , which rolled in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 22]: Weeping , he stooped to retrieve it , and Marjorie , to prevent him , hastily set her foot upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 25]: Penrod offered another jaw-breaker ; but Mitchy-Mitch struck it from his hand , desiring the former , which had convinced him of its sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 24]: Marjorie moved inadvertently ; whereupon Mitchy-Mitch pounced upon the remains of his jaw-breaker and restored them , with accretions , to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 32]: His sister , uttering a cry of horror , sprang to the rescue , assisted by Penrod , whom she prevailed upon to hold Mitchy-Mitch 's mouth open while she excavated .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 38]: This operation being completed , and Penrod 's right thumb severely bitten , Mitchy-Mitch closed his eyes tightly , stamped , squealed , bellowed , wrung his hands , and then , unexpectedly , kicked Penrod again .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 23]: Penrod put a hand in his pocket and drew forth a copper two-cent piece , large , round , and fairly bright .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 6]: He gave it to Mitchy-Mitch .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 16]: Mitchy-Mitch immediately stopped crying and gazed upon his benefactor with the eyes of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 3]: This world !
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 25]: Thereafter did Penrod -- with complete approval from Mitchy-Mitch -- play the accordion for his lady to his heart 's content , and hers .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 20]: Never had he so won upon her ; never had she let him feel so close to her before .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 31]: They strolled up and down upon the sidewalk , eating , one thought between them , and soon she had learned to play the accordion almost as well as he .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 51]: So passed a happy hour , which the Good King Rene of Anjou would have envied them , while Mitchy-Mitch made friends with Duke , romped about his sister and her swain , and clung to the hand of the latter , at intervals , with fondest affection and trust .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 35]: The noon whistles failed to disturb this little Arcady ; only the sound of Mrs. Jones ' voice for the third time summoning Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch to lunch -- sent Penrod on his way .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 18]: `` I could come back this afternoon , I guess , '' he said , in parting .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: `` I 'm not goin ' to be here .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 11]: I 'm goin ' to Baby Rennsdale 's party . ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 10]: Penrod looked blank , as she intended he should .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 21]: Having thus satisfied herself , she added : `` There are n't goin ' to be any boys there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 6]: He was instantly radiant again .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 8]: `` Marjorie -- '' `` Hum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 13]: `` Do you wish I was goin ' to be there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 10]: She looked shy , and turned away her head .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 5]: `` MARJORIE JONES ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: -LRB- This was a voice from home . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 13]: `` HOW MANY MORE TIMES SHALL I HAVE TO CALL YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 11]: Marjorie moved away , her face still hidden from Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 3]: he urged .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 24]: At the gate , she turned quickly toward him , and said over her shoulder , all in a breath : `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 12]: Come again to-morrow morning and I 'll be on the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 6]: Bring your ` cordion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 24]: And she ran into the house , Mitchy-Mitch waving a loving hand to the boy on the sidewalk until the front door closed .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 36]: CHAPTER XIX THE INNER BOY Penrod went home in splendour , pretending that he and Duke were a long procession ; and he made enough noise to render the auricular part of the illusion perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 24]: His own family were already at the lunch-table when he arrived , and the parade halted only at the door of the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 5]: `` Oh SOMETHING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 12]: shouted Mr. Schofield , clasping his bilious brow with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 5]: `` Stop that noise !
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 10]: Is n't it awful enough for you to SING ?
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: Sit DOWN !
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 6]: Not with that thing on !
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: Take that green rope off your shoulder !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 15]: Now take that thing out of the dining-room and throw it in the ash-can !
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 7]: Where did you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 10]: `` Where did I get what , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 16]: asked Penrod meekly , depositing the accordion in the hall just outside the dining-room door .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 9]: `` That da -- that third-hand concertina . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 39]: `` It 's a ` cordian , '' said Penrod , taking his place at the table , and noticing that both Margaret and Mr. Robert Williams -LRB- who happened to be a guest -RRB- were growing red .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 16]: `` I do n't care what you call it , '' said Mr. Schofield irritably .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 11]: `` I want to know where you got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 13]: Penrod 's eyes met Margaret 's : hers had a strained expression .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 7]: She very slightly shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 43]: Penrod sent Mr. Williams a grateful look , and might have been startled if he could have seen himself in a mirror at that moment ; for he regarded Mitchy-Mitch with concealed but vigorous aversion and the resemblance would have horrified him .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 43]: `` A man gave it to me , '' he answered gently , and was rewarded by the visibly regained ease of his patron 's manner , while Margaret leaned back in her chair and looked at her brother with real devotion .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 16]: `` I should think he 'd have been glad to , '' said Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 6]: `` Who was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 4]: `` Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 25]: In spite of the candy which he had consumed in company with Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch , Penrod had begun to eat lobster croquettes earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 6]: `` Who WAS he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 9]: `` Who do you mean , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 11]: `` The man that gave you that ghastly Thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 3]: `` Yessir .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 8]: A man gave it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 9]: `` I say , Who WAS he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 4]: shouted Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 43]: `` Well , I was just walking along , and the man came up to me -- it was right down in front of Colgate 's , where most of the paint 's rubbed off the fence -- '' `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 8]: The father used his most dangerous tone .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 4]: `` Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 12]: `` Who was the man that gave you the concertina ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 14]: I was walking along -- '' `` You never saw him before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 18]: I was just walk -- '' `` That will do , '' said Mr. Schofield , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 16]: `` I suppose every family has its secret enemies and this was one of ours .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 8]: I must ask to be excused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 19]: With that , he went out crossly , stopping in the hall a moment before passing beyond hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 40]: And , after lunch , Penrod sought in vain for his accordion ; he even searched the library where his father sat reading , though , upon inquiry , Penrod explained that he was looking for a misplaced schoolbook .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 18]: He thought he ought to study a little every day , he said , even during vacation-time .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 34]: Much pleased , Mr. Schofield rose and joined the search , finding the missing work on mathematics with singular ease -- which cost him precisely the price of the book the following September .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 8]: Penrod departed to study in the backyard .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 27]: There , after a cautious survey of the neighbourhood , he managed to dislodge the iron cover of the cistern , and dropped the arithmetic within .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: A fine splash rewarded his listening ear .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 49]: Thus assured that when he looked for that book again no one would find it for him , he replaced the cover , and betook himself pensively to the highway , discouraging Duke from following by repeated volleys of stones , some imaginary and others all too real .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 48]: Distant strains of brazen horns and the throbbing of drums were borne to him upon the kind breeze , reminding him that the world was made for joy , and that the Barzee and Potter Dog and Pony Show was exhibiting in a banlieue not far away .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: So , thither he bent his steps -- the plentiful funds in his pocket burning hot holes all the way .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 48]: He had paid twenty-two cents for the accordion , and fifteen for candy ; he had bought the mercenary heart of Mitchy-Mitch for two : it certainly follows that there remained to him of his dollar , sixty-one cents -- a fair fortune , and most unusual .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 29]: Arrived upon the populous and festive scene of the Dog and Pony Show , he first turned his attention to the brightly decorated booths which surrounded the tent .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 61]: The cries of the peanut vendors , of the popcorn men , of the toy-balloon sellers , the stirring music of the band , playing before the performance to attract a crowd , the shouting of excited children and the barking of the dogs within the tent , all sounded exhilaratingly in Penrod 's ears and set his blood a-tingle .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 19]: Nevertheless , he did not squander his money or fling it to the winds in one grand splurge .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 34]: Instead , he began cautiously with the purchase of an extraordinarily large pickle , which he obtained from an aged negress for his odd cent , too obvious a bargain to be missed .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 24]: At an adjacent stand he bought a glass of raspberry lemonade -LRB- so alleged -RRB- and sipped it as he ate the pickle .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 6]: He left nothing of either .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 36]: Next , he entered a small restaurant-tent and for a modest nickel was supplied with a fork and a box of sardines , previously opened , it is true , but more than half full .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 34]: He consumed the sardines utterly , but left the tin box and the fork , after which he indulged in an inexpensive half-pint of lukewarm cider , at one of the open booths .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 79]: Mug in hand , a gentle glow radiating toward his surface from various centres of activity deep inside him , he paused for breath -- and the cool , sweet cadences of the watermelon man fell delectably upon his ear : `` Ice-cole WATER-melon ; ice-cole water-MELON ; the biggest slice of ICE-cole , ripe , red , ICE-cole , rich an ' rare ; the biggest slice of ice-cole watermelon ever cut by the hand of man !
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: BUY our ICE-cole water-melon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 39]: Penrod , having drained the last drop of cider , complied with the watermelon man 's luscious entreaty , and received a round slice of the fruit , magnificent in circumference and something over an inch in thickness .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 51]: Leaving only the really dangerous part of the rind behind him , he wandered away from the vicinity of the watermelon man and supplied himself with a bag of peanuts , which , with the expenditure of a dime for admission , left a quarter still warm in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 35]: However , he managed to `` break '' the coin at a stand inside the tent , where a large , oblong paper box of popcorn was handed him , with twenty cents change .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 38]: The box was too large to go into his pocket , but , having seated himself among some wistful Polack children , he placed it in his lap and devoured the contents at leisure during the performance .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 28]: The popcorn was heavily larded with partially boiled molasses , and Penrod sandwiched mouthfuls of peanuts with gobs of this mass until the peanuts were all gone .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 39]: After that , he ate with less avidity ; a sense almost of satiety beginning to manifest itself to him , and it was not until the close of the performance that he disposed of the last morsel .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 29]: He descended a little heavily to the outflowing crowd in the arena , and bought a caterwauling toy balloon , but showed no great enthusiasm in manipulating it .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 46]: Near the exit , as he came out , was a hot-waffle stand which he had overlooked , and a sense of duty obliged him to consume the three waffles , thickly powdered with sugar , which the waffle man cooked for him upon command .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 57]: They left a hottish taste in his mouth ; they had not been quite up to his anticipation , indeed , and it was with a sense of relief that he turned to the `` hokey-pokey '' cart which stood close at hand , laden with square slabs of `` Neapolitan ice-cream '' wrapped in paper .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 27]: He thought the ice-cream would be cooling , but somehow it fell short of the desired effect , and left a peculiar savour in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 20]: He walked away , too languid to blow his balloon , and passed a fresh-taffy booth with strange indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 51]: A bare-armed man was manipulating the taffy over a hook , pulling a great white mass to the desired stage of `` candying , '' but Penrod did not pause to watch the operation ; in fact , he averted his eyes -LRB- which were slightly glazed -RRB- in passing .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 24]: He did not analyze his motives : simply , he was conscious that he preferred not to look at the mass of taffy .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 43]: For some reason , he put a considerable distance between himself and the taffy-stand , but before long halted in the presence of a red-faced man who flourished a long fork over a small cooking apparatus and shouted jovially : `` Winnies !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 6]: HERE 'S your hot winnies !
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 3]: Hot winny-WURST !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 19]: Food for the over-worked brain , nourishing for the weak stummick , entertaining for the tired business man !
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 18]: HERE 'S your hot winnies , three for a nickel , a half-a-dime , the twentieth-pot-of-a-dollah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 16]: This , above all nectar and ambrosia , was the favourite dish of Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: Nothing inside him now craved it -- on the contrary !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 31]: But memory is the great hypnotist ; his mind argued against his inwards that opportunity knocked at his door : `` winny-wurst '' was rigidly forbidden by the home authorities .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 18]: Besides , there was a last nickel in his pocket ; and nature protested against its survival .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 16]: Also , the redfaced man had himself proclaimed his wares nourishing for the weak stummick .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 13]: Penrod placed the nickel in the red hand of the red-faced man .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 17]: He ate two of the three greasy , cigarlike shapes cordially pressed upon him in return .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 27]: The first bite convinced him that he had made a mistake ; these winnies seemed of a very inferior flavour , almost unpleasant , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 20]: But he felt obliged to conceal his poor opinion of them , for fear of offending the red-faced man .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 30]: He ate without haste or eagerness -- so slowly , indeed , that he began to think the redfaced man might dislike him , as a deterrent of trade .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 55]: Perhaps Penrod 's mind was not working well , for he failed to remember that no law compelled him to remain under the eye of the red-faced man , but the virulent repulsion excited by his attempt to take a bite of the third sausage inspired him with at least an excuse for postponement .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 23]: `` Mighty good , '' he murmured feebly , placing the sausage in the pocket of his jacket with a shaking hand .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 18]: `` Guess I 'll save this one to eat at home , after -- after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 13]: He moved sluggishly away , wishing he had not thought of dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 30]: A side-show , undiscovered until now , failed to arouse his interest , not even exciting a wish that he had known of its existence when he had money .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 28]: For a time he stared without attraction ; the weather-worn colours conveying no meaning to comprehension at a huge canvas poster depicting the chief his torpid eye .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 15]: Then , little by little , the poster became more vivid to his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 19]: There was a greenish-tinted person in the tent , it seemed , who thrived upon a reptilian diet .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 12]: Suddenly , Penrod decided that it was time to go home .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 45]: CHAPTER XX BROTHERS OF ANGELS `` Indeed , doctor , '' said Mrs. Schofield , with agitation and profound conviction , just after eight o'clock that evening , `` I shall ALWAYS believe in mustard plasters -- mustard plasters and hot -- water bags .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 25]: If it had n't been for them I do n't believed he 'd have LIVED till you got here -- I do NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 26]: `` Margaret , '' called Mr. Schofield from the open door of a bedroom , `` Margaret , where did you put that aromatic ammonia ?
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 5]: Where 's Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 20]: But he had to find the aromatic spirits of ammonia himself , for Margaret was not in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 30]: She stood in the shadow beneath a maple tree near the street corner , a guitar-case in her hand ; and she scanned with anxiety a briskly approaching figure .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 17]: The arc light , swinging above , revealed this figure as that of him she awaited .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 19]: He was passing toward the gate without seeing her , when she arrested him with a fateful whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 4]: `` BOB ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 7]: Mr. Robert Williams swung about hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 6]: `` Why , Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 12]: `` Here , take your guitar , '' she whispered hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 19]: `` I was afraid if father happened to find it he 'd break it all to pieces ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 5]: asked the startled Robert .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 12]: `` Because I 'm sure he knows it 's yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 23]: `` But what -- '' `` Oh , Bob , '' she moaned , `` I was waiting here to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 16]: I was so afraid you 'd try to come in -- '' `` TRY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 9]: exclaimed the unfortunate young man , quite dumfounded .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 14]: `` TRY to come -- '' `` Yes , before I warned you .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 34]: I 've been waiting here to tell you , Bob , you must n't come near the house if I were you I 'd stay away from even this neighbourhood -- far away !
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 42]: For a while I do n't think it would be actually SAFE for -- '' `` Margaret , will you please -- '' `` It 's all on account of that dollar you gave Penrod this morning , '' she walled .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 31]: `` First , he bought that horrible concertina that made papa so furious -- '' `` But Penrod did n't tell that I -- '' `` Oh , wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 4]: she cried lamentably .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 19]: He did n't tell at lunch , but he got home about dinner-time in the most -- well !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 12]: I 've seen pale people before , but nothing like Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 12]: Nobody could IMAGINE it -- not unless they 'd seen him !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 41]: And he looked , so STRANGE , and kept making such unnatural faces , and at first all he would say was that he 'd eaten a little piece of apple and thought it must have some microbes on it .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 55]: But he got sicker and sicker , and we put him to bed -- and then we all thought he was going to die -- and , of COURSE , no little piece of apple would have -- well , and he kept getting worse and then he said he 'd had a dollar .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 96]: He said he 'd spent it for the concertina , and watermelon , and chocolate-creams , and licorice sticks , and lemon-drops , and peanuts , and jaw-breakers , and sardines , and raspberry lemonade , and pickles , and popcorn , and ice-cream , and cider , and sausage -- there was sausage in his pocket , and mamma says his jacket is ruined -- and cinnamon drops -- and waffles -- and he ate four or five lobster croquettes at lunch -- and papa said , ` Who gave you that dollar ? '
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 16]: Only he did n't say ` WHO ' -- he said something horrible , Bob !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 21]: And Penrod thought he was going to die , and he said you gave it to him , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 31]: it was just pitiful to hear the poor child , Bob , because he thought he was dying , you see , and he blamed you for the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 33]: He said if you 'd only let him alone and not given it to him , he 'd have grown up to be a good man -- and now he could n't !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 35]: I never heard anything so heart-rending -- he was so weak he could hardly whisper , but he kept trying to talk , telling us over and over it was all your fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 19]: In the darkness Mr. Williams ' facial expression could not be seen , but his voice sounded hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 15]: `` Is he -- is he still in a great deal of pain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 21]: `` They say the crisis is past , '' said Margaret , `` but the doctor 's still up there .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 23]: He said it was the acutest case of indigestion he had ever treated in the whole course of his professional practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 21]: `` Of course _ I _ did n't know what he 'd do with the dollar , '' said Robert .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: She did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 32]: He began plaintively , `` Margaret , you do n't -- '' `` I 've never seen papa and mamma so upset about anything , '' she said , rather primly .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 10]: `` You mean they 're upset about ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 35]: `` We ARE all very much upset , '' returned Margaret , more starch in her tone as she remembered not only Penrod 's sufferings but a duty she had vowed herself to perform .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 3]: `` Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 77]: YOU do n't -- '' `` Robert , '' she said firmly and , also , with a rhetorical complexity which breeds a suspicion of pre-rehearsal -- `` Robert , for the present I can only look at it in one way : when you gave that money to Penrod you put into the hands of an unthinking little child a weapon which might be , and , indeed was , the means of his undoing .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 26]: Boys are not respon -- '' `` But you saw me give him the dollar , and you did n't -- '' `` Robert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 7]: she checked him with increasing severity .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 28]: `` I am only a woman and not accustomed to thinking everything out on the spur of the moment ; but I can not change my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 7]: Not now , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 13]: `` And you think I 'd better not come in to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 4]: `` To-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 5]: `` Not for WEEKS !
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 37]: Papa would -- '' `` But Margaret , '' he urged plaintively , `` how can you blame me for -- '' `` I have not used the word ` blame , ' '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 31]: `` But I must insist that for your carelessness to -- to wreak such havoc -- can not fail to -- to lessen my confidence in your powers of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 22]: I can not change my convictions in this matter -- not to-night -- and I can not remain here another instant .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 7]: The poor child may need me .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 5]: Robert , good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 33]: With chill dignity she withdrew , entered the house , and returned to the sick-room , leaving the young man in outer darkness to brood upon his crime -- and upon Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 32]: That sincere invalid became convalescent upon the third day ; and a week elapsed , then , before he found an opportunity to leave the house unaccompanied -- save by Duke .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 33]: But at last he set forth and approached the Jones neighbourhood in high spirits , pleasantly conscious of his pallor , hollow cheeks , and other perquisites of illness provocative of interest .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 18]: One thought troubled him a little because it gave him a sense of inferiority to a rival .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 49]: He believed , against his will , that Maurice Levy could have successfully eaten chocolate-creams , licorice sticks , lemon-drops , jaw-breakers , peanuts , waffles , lobster croquettes , sardines , cinnamon-drops , watermelon , pickles , popcorn , ice-cream and sausage with raspberry lemonade and cider .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 44]: Penrod had admitted to himself that Maurice could do it and afterward attend to business , or pleasure , without the slightest discomfort ; and this was probably no more than a fair estimate of one of the great constitutions of all time .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 12]: As a digester , Maurice Levy would have disappointed a Borgia .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 17]: Fortunately , Maurice was still at Atlantic City -- and now the convalescent 's heart leaped .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 21]: In the distance he saw Marjorie coming -- in pink again , with a ravishing little parasol over her head .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 3]: And alone !
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 8]: No Mitchy-Mitch was to mar this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 20]: Penrod increased the feebleness of his steps , now and then leaning upon the fence as if for support .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Marjorie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 14]: he said , in his best sick-room voice , as she came near .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 22]: To his pained amazement , she proceeded on her way , her nose at a celebrated elevation -- an icy nose .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 5]: She cut him dead .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 15]: He threw his invalid 's airs to the winds , and hastened after her .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 13]: `` Marjorie , '' he pleaded , `` what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 4]: Are you mad ?
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 24]: Honest , that day you said to come back next morning , and you 'd be on the corner , I was sick .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 9]: Honest , I was AWFUL sick , Marjorie !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 12]: I had to have the doctor -- '' `` DOCTOR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: She whirled upon him , her lovely eyes blazing .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 23]: `` I guess WE 'VE had to have the doctor enough at OUR house , thanks to you , Mister Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 31]: Papa says you have n't got NEAR sense enough to come in out of the rain , after what you did to poor little Mitchy-Mitch -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 12]: `` Yes , and he 's sick in bed YET ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 8]: Marjorie went on , with unabated fury .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 25]: `` And papa says if he ever catches you in this part of town -- '' `` WHAT 'D I do to Mitchy-Mitch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 3]: gasped Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 12]: `` You know well enough what you did to Mitchy-Mitch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 14]: `` You gave him that great , big , nasty two-cent piece ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 6]: `` Mitchy-Mitch swallowed it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 27]: `` And papa says if he ever just lays eyes on you , once , in this neighbourhood -- '' But Penrod had started for home .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 16]: In his embittered heart there was increasing a critical disapproval of the Creator 's methods .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 20]: When He made pretty girls , thought Penrod , why could n't He have left out their little brothers !
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 63]: CHAPTER XXI RUPE COLLINS For several days after this , Penrod thought of growing up to be a monk , and engaged in good works so far as to carry some kittens -LRB- that otherwise would have been drowned -RRB- and a pair of Margaret 's outworn dancing-slippers to a poor , ungrateful old man sojourning in a shed up the alley .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 52]: And although Mr. Robert Williams , after a very short interval , began to leave his guitar on the front porch again , exactly as if he thought nothing had happened , Penrod , with his younger vision of a father 's mood , remained coldly distant from the Jones neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 22]: With his own family his manner was gentle , proud and sad , but not for long enough to frighten them .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: The change came with mystifying abruptness at the end of the week .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 8]: It was Duke who brought it about .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 19]: Duke could chase a much bigger dog out of the Schofields ' yard and far down the street .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 28]: This might be thought to indicate unusual valour on the part of Duke and cowardice on that of the bigger dogs whom he undoubtedly put to rout .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 55]: On the contrary , all such flights were founded in mere superstition , for dogs are even more superstitious than boys and coloured people ; and the most firmly established of all dog superstitions is that any dog -- be he the smallest and feeblest in the world -- can whip any trespasser whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 14]: A rat-terrier believes that on his home grounds he can whip an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 30]: It follows , of course , that a big dog , away from his own home , will run from a little dog in the little dog 's neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 22]: Otherwise , the big dog must face a charge of inconsistency , and dogs are as consistent as they are superstitious .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 69]: A dog believes in war , but he is convinced that there are times when it is moral to run ; and the thoughtful physiognomist , seeing a big dog fleeing out of a little dog 's yard , must observe that the expression of the big dog 's face is more conscientious than alarmed : it is the expression of a person performing a duty to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 58]: Penrod understood these matters perfectly ; he knew that the gaunt brown hound Duke chased up the alley had fled only out of deference to a custom , yet Penrod could not refrain from bragging of Duke to the hound 's owner , a fat-faced stranger of twelve or thirteen , who had wandered into the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 24]: `` You better keep that ole yellow dog o ' yours back , '' said Penrod ominously , as he climbed the fence .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 17]: `` You better catch him and hold him till I get mine inside the yard again .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 12]: Duke 's chewed up some pretty bad bulldogs around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: The fat-faced boy gave Penrod a fishy stare .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 15]: `` You 'd oughta learn him not to do that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 8]: `` It 'll make him sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 5]: `` What will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 50]: The stranger laughed raspingly and gazed up the alley , where the hound , having come to a halt , now coolly sat down , and , with an expression of roguish benevolence , patronizingly watched the tempered fury of Duke , whose assaults and barkings were becoming perfunctory .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 8]: `` What 'll make Duke sick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 3]: Penrod demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 11]: `` Eatin ' dead bulldogs people leave around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 38]: This was not improvisation but formula , adapted from other occasions to the present encounter ; nevertheless , it was new to Penrod , and he was so taken with it that resentment lost itself in admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 29]: Hastily committing the gem to memory for use upon a dog-owning friend , he inquired in a sociable tone : `` What 's your dog 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 3]: `` Dan .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 14]: You better call your ole pup , 'cause Dan eats LIVE dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 37]: Dan 's actions poorly supported his master 's assertion , for , upon Duke 's ceasing to bark , Dan rose and showed the most courteous interest in making the little , old dog 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 52]: Dan had a great deal of manner , and it became plain that Duke was impressed favourably in spite of former prejudice , so that presently the two trotted amicably back to their masters and sat down with the harmonious but indifferent air of having known each other intimately for years .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 17]: They were received without comment , though both boys looked at them reflectively for a time .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 7]: It was Penrod who spoke first .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 8]: `` What number you go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 36]: -LRB- In an `` oral lesson in English , '' Penrod had been instructed to put this question in another form : `` May I ask which of our public schools you attend ? '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 8]: What number do I go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 6]: said the stranger , contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 12]: `` I do n't go to NO number in vacation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: `` I mean when it ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 9]: `` Third , '' returned the fat-faced boy .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 11]: `` I got 'em ALL scared in THAT school . ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 5]: `` What of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 22]: innocently asked Penrod , to whom `` the Third '' -- in a distant part of town -- was undiscovered country .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 4]: `` What of ?
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 20]: I guess you 'd soon see what of , if you ever was in that school about one day .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 11]: You 'd be lucky if you got out alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 7]: `` Are the teachers mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 8]: The other boy frowned with bitter scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 3]: `` Teachers !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 12]: Teachers do n't order ME around , I can tell you !
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: They 're mighty careful how they try to run over Rupe Collins . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 7]: `` Who 's Rupe Collins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: `` Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 6]: echoed the fat-faced boy incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 11]: `` Say , ai n't you got ANY sense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 17]: `` Say , would n't you be just as happy if you had SOME sense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 4]: `` Ye-es . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 19]: Penrod 's answer , like the look he lifted to the impressive stranger , was meek and placative .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 13]: `` Rupe Collins is the principal at your school , guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 16]: The other yelled with jeering laughter , and mocked Penrod 's manner and voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 15]: ` Rupe Collins is the principal at your school , I guess ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 10]: He laughed harshly again , then suddenly showed truculence .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 20]: `` Say , ` bo , why n't you learn enough to go in the house when it rains ?
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 10]: What 's the matter of you , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 34]: `` Well , '' urged Penrod timidly , `` nobody ever TOLD me who Rupe Collins is : I got a RIGHT to think he 's the principal , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 8]: The fat-faced boy shook his head disgustedly .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 9]: `` Honest , you make me sick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 8]: Penrod 's expression became one of despair .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: `` Well , who IS he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 4]: he cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 7]: ` Who IS he ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 11]: mocked the other , with a scorn that withered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: ` Who IS he ? '
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 3]: ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 24]: Penrod was humiliated but relieved : he felt that he had proved himself criminally ignorant , yet a peril seemed to have passed .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 12]: `` Rupe Collins is your name , then , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 12]: I kind of thought it was , all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 16]: The fat-faced boy still appeared embittered , burlesquing this speech in a hateful falsetto . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: ` Rupe Collins is YOUR name , then , I guess ! '
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 19]: Oh , you ` kind of thought it was , all the time , ' did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 19]: Suddenly concentrating his brow into a histrionic scowl he thrust his face within an inch of Penrod 's .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 31]: `` Yes , sonny , Rupe Collins is my name , and you better look out what you say when he 's around or you 'll get in big trouble !
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 8]: YOU UNDERSTAND THAT , ` BO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 19]: Penrod was cowed but fascinated : he felt that there was something dangerous and dashing about this newcomer .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' he said , feebly , drawing back .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: `` My name 's Penrod Schofield . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 25]: `` Then I reckon your father and mother ai n't got good sense , '' said Mr. Collins promptly , this also being formula .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 5]: `` Why ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 14]: 'Cause if they had they 'd of give you a good name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 28]: And the agreeable youth instantly rewarded himself for the wit with another yell of rasping laughter , after which he pointed suddenly at Penrod 's right hand .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 12]: `` Where 'd you get that wart on your finger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 4]: he demanded severely .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 5]: `` Which finger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 9]: asked the mystified Penrod , extending his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 6]: `` The middle one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 17]: exclaimed Rupe Collins , seizing and vigorously twisting the wartless finger naively offered for his inspection .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 4]: `` Quit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 5]: shouted Penrod in agony .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 4]: `` QUEE-yut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 6]: `` Say your prayers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 17]: commanded Rupe , and continued to twist the luckless finger until Penrod writhed to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 4]: `` OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 13]: The victim , released , looked grievously upon the still painful finger .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 12]: At this Rupe 's scornful expression altered to one of contrition .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 7]: `` Well , I declare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 4]: he exclaimed remorsefully .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 11]: `` I did n't s ` pose it would hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 15]: Turn about 's fair play ; so now you do that to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 61]: He extended the middle finger of his left hand and Penrod promptly seized it , but did not twist it , for he was instantly swung round with his back to his amiable new acquaintance : Rupe 's right hand operated upon the back of Penrod 's slender neck ; Rupe 's knee tortured the small of Penrod 's back .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 4]: `` OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 12]: Penrod bent far forward involuntarily and went to his knees again .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 25]: `` Lick dirt , '' commanded Rupe , forcing the captive 's face to the sidewalk ; and the suffering Penrod completed this ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 11]: Mr. Collins evinced satisfaction by means of his horse laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 14]: `` You 'd last jest about one day up at the Third ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 22]: `` You 'd come runnin ' home , yellin ' ` MOM-MUH , MOM-muh , ' before recess was over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 17]: `` No , I would n't , '' Penrod protested rather weakly , dusting his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 7]: `` You would , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 27]: `` No , I w -- `` Looky here , '' said the fat-faced boy , darkly , `` what you mean , counterdicking me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 11]: He advanced a step and Penrod hastily qualified his contradiction .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 11]: `` I mean , I do n't THINK I would .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 10]: I -- '' `` You better look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 15]: Rupe moved closer , and unexpectedly grasped the back of Penrod 's neck again .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 16]: `` Say , ' I WOULD run home yellin ' `` MOM-muh ! '' ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 11]: I WOULD run home yellin ' ` Mom-muh . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 11]: said Rupe , giving the helpless nape a final squeeze .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 13]: `` That 's the way we do up at the Third . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 22]: Penrod rubbed his neck and asked meekly : `` Can you do that to any boy up at the Third ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 26]: `` See here now , '' said Rupe , in the tone of one goaded beyond all endurance , `` YOU say if I can !
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 28]: You better say it quick , or -- '' `` I knew you could , '' Penrod interposed hastily , with the pathetic semblance of a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: `` I only said that in fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 7]: `` In ` fun ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: repeated Rupe stormily .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 21]: `` You better look out how you -- '' `` Well , I SAID I was n't in earnest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 7]: Penrod retreated a few steps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 11]: _ I _ knew you could , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 20]: I expect _ I _ could do it to some of the boys up at the Third , myself .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 5]: Could n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 8]: `` No , you could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 22]: `` Well , there must be SOME boy up there that I could -- '' `` No , they ai n't !
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 17]: You better -- '' `` I expect not , then , '' said Penrod , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 8]: `` You BETTER ` expect not . '
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 23]: Did n't I tell you once you 'd never get back alive if you ever tried to come up around the Third ?
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 16]: You want me to SHOW you how we do up there , ` bo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 48]: He began a slow and deadly advance , whereupon Penrod timidly offered a diversion : `` Say , Rupe , I got a box of rats in our stable under a glass cover , so you can watch 'em jump around when you hammer on the box .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: Come on and look at 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 13]: `` All right , '' said the fat-faced boy , slightly mollified .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 9]: `` We 'll let Dan kill 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 5]: `` No , SIR !
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 8]: I 'm goin ' to keep 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 29]: They 're kind of pets ; I 've had 'em all summer -- I got names for em , and -- '' `` Looky here , ` bo .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 14]: Did you hear me say we 'll let ` Dan kill 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 16]: `` Yes , but I wo n't -- '' `` WHAT wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 5]: Rupe became sinister immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 15]: `` It seems to me you 're gettin ' pretty fresh around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 42]: `` Well , I do n't want -- '' Mr. Collins once more brought into play the dreadful eye-to-eye scowl as practised `` up at the Third , '' and , sometimes , also by young leading men upon the stage .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 28]: Frowning appallingly , and thrusting forward his underlip , he placed his nose almost in contact with the nose of Penrod , whose eyes naturally became crossed .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: `` Dan kills the rats .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 10]: hissed the fat-faced boy , maintaining the horrible juxtaposition .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 12]: `` Well , all right , '' said Penrod , swallowing .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 9]: `` I do n't want 'em much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 22]: And when the pose had been relaxed , he stared at his new friend for a moment , almost with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 4]: Then he brightened .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 7]: `` Come on , Rupe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 10]: he cried enthusiastically , as he climbed the fence .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 15]: `` We 'll give our dogs a little live meat -- ` bo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 54]: CHAPTER XXII THE IMITATOR At the dinner-table , that evening , Penrod Surprised his family by remarking , in a voice they had never heard him attempt -- a law-giving voice of intentional gruffness : `` Any man that 's makin ' a hunderd dollars a month is makin ' good money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 22]: asked Mr. Schofield , staring , for the previous conversation had concerned the illness of an infant relative in Council Bluffs .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 19]: `` Any man that 's makin ' a hunderd dollars a month is makin ' good money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 8]: `` What IS he talking about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 6]: Margaret appealed to the invisible .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 21]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , frowning , `` that 's what foremen at the ladder works get . ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 10]: `` How in the world do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 7]: `` Well , I KNOW it !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 14]: A hunderd dollars a month is good money , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 6]: said the father , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 9]: I only said it was good money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 31]: Mr. Schofield shook his head , dismissing the subject ; and here he made a mistake : he should have followed up his son 's singular contribution to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 23]: That would have revealed the fact that there was a certain Rupe Collins whose father was a foreman at the ladder works .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 17]: All clues are important when a boy makes his first remark in a new key . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 6]: ` Good money ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 5]: repeated Margaret , curiously .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 9]: `` What is ` good ' money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 8]: Penrod turned upon her a stern glance .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 17]: `` Say , would n't you be just as happy if you had SOME sense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 4]: shouted his father .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 22]: But Penrod 's mother gazed with dismay at her son : he had never before spoken like that to his sister .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 24]: Mrs. Schofield might have been more dismayed than she was , if she had realized that it was the beginning of an epoch .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 34]: After dinner , Penrod was slightly scalded in the back as the result of telling Della , the cook , that there was a wart on the middle finger of her right hand .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 34]: Della thus proving poor material for his new manner to work upon , he approached Duke , in the backyard , and , bending double , seized the lowly animal by the forepaws .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 16]: `` I let you know my name 's Penrod Schofield , '' hissed the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 21]: He protruded his underlip ferociously , scowled , and thrust forward his head until his nose touched the dog 's .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 20]: `` And you better look out when Penrod Schofield 's around , or you 'll get in big trouble !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 9]: YOU UNDERSTAN ' THAT , ` BO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 27]: The next day , and the next , the increasing change in Penrod puzzled and distressed his family , who had no idea of its source .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: How might they guess that hero-worship takes such forms ?
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 63]: They were vaguely conscious that a rather shabby boy , not of the neighbourhood , came to `` play '' with Penrod several times ; but they failed to connect this circumstance with the peculiar behaviour of the son of the house , whose ideals -LRB- his father remarked -RRB- seemed to have suddenly become identical with those of Gyp the Blood .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 18]: Meanwhile , for Penrod himself , `` life had taken on new meaning , new richness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 12]: He had become a fighting man -- in conversation at least .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 21]: `` Do you want to know how I do when they try to slip up on me from behind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 4]: he asked Della .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 25]: And he enacted for her unappreciative eye a scene of fistic manoeuvres wherein he held an imaginary antagonist helpless in a net of stratagems .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 35]: Frequently , when he was alone , he would outwit , and pummel this same enemy , and , after a cunning feint , land a dolorous stroke full upon a face of air .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 9]: I guess you 'll know better next time .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 12]: That 's the way we do up at the Third ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 57]: Sometimes , in solitary pantomime , he encountered more than one opponent at a time , for numbers were apt to come upon him treacherously , especially at a little after his rising hour , when he might be caught at a disadvantage -- perhaps standing on one leg to encase the other in his knickerbockers .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 29]: Like lightning , he would hurl the trapping garment from him , and , ducking and pivoting , deal great sweeping blows among the circle of sneaking devils .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 13]: -LRB- That was how he broke the clock in his bedroom . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 47]: And while these battles were occupying his attention , it was a waste of voice to call him to breakfast , though if his mother , losing patience , came to his room , she would find him seated on the bed pulling at a stocking .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 13]: `` Well , ai n't I coming fast as I CAN ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 48]: At the table and about the house generally he was bumptious , loud with fatuous misinformation , and assumed a domineering tone , which neither satire nor reproof seemed able to reduce : but it was among his own intimates that his new superiority was most outrageous .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 53]: He twisted the fingers and squeezed the necks of all the boys of the neighbourhood , meeting their indignation with a hoarse and rasping laugh he had acquired after short practice in the stable , where he jeered and taunted the lawn-mower , the garden-scythe and the wheelbarrow quite out of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 25]: Likewise he bragged to the other boys by the hour , Rupe Collins being the chief subject of encomium -- next to Penrod himself .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 66]: `` That 's the way we do up at the Third , '' became staple explanation of violence , for Penrod , like Tartarin , was plastic in the hands of his own imagination , and at times convinced himself that he really was one of those dark and murderous spirits exclusively of whom `` the Third '' was composed -- according to Rupe Collins .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 31]: Then , when Penrod had exhausted himself repeating to nausea accounts of the prowess of himself and his great friend , he would turn to two other subjects for vainglory .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 7]: These were his father and Duke .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 18]: Mothers must accept the fact that between babyhood and manhood their sons do not boast of them .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 22]: The boy , with boys , is a Choctaw ; and either the influence or the protection of women is shameful .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 13]: `` Your mother wo n't let you , '' is an insult .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 21]: But , `` My father wo n't let me , '' is a dignified explanation and can not be hooted .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 49]: A boy is ruined among his fellows if he talks much of his mother or sisters ; and he must recognize it as his duty to offer at least the appearance of persecution to all things ranked as female , such as cats and every species of fowl .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 33]: But he must champion his father and his dog , and , ever , ready to pit either against any challenger , must picture both as ravening for battle and absolutely unconquerable .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 67]: Penrod , of course , had always talked by the code , but , under the new stimulus , Duke was represented virtually as a cross between Bob , Son of Battle , and a South American vampire ; and this in spite of the fact that Duke himself often sat close by , a living lie , with the hope of peace in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 33]: As for Penrod 's father , that gladiator was painted as of sentiments and dimensions suitable to a super-demon composed of equal parts of Goliath , Jack Johnson and the Emperor Nero .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 60]: Even Penrod 's walk was affected ; he adopted a gait which was a kind of taunting swagger ; and , when he passed other children on the street , he practised the habit of feinting a blow ; then , as the victim dodged , he rasped the triumphant horse laugh which he gradually mastered to horrible perfection .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 9]: He did this to Marjorie Jones -- ay !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 13]: this was their next meeting , and such is Eros , young !
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 37]: What was even worse , in Marjorie 's opinion , he went on his way without explanation , and left her standing on the corner talking about it , long after he was out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 16]: Within five days from his first encounter with Rupe Collins , Penrod had become unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 36]: He even almost alienated Sam Williams , who for a time submitted to finger twisting and neck squeezing and the new style of conversation , but finally declared that Penrod made him `` sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 25]: He made the statement with fervour , one sultry afternoon , in Mr. Schofield 's stable , in the presence of Herman and Verman .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 15]: `` You better look out , ` bo , '' said Penrod , threateningly .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 16]: `` I 'll show you a little how we do up at the Third . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 7]: `` Up at the Third ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 5]: Sam repeated with scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 10]: `` You have n't ever been up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 6]: `` I have n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 3]: cried Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 6]: `` I HAVE N'T ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 8]: `` No , you have n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 5]: `` Looky here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 12]: Penrod , darkly argumentative , prepared to perform the eye-to-eye business .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 10]: `` When have n't I been up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 10]: `` You have n't NEVER been up there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 18]: In spite of Penrod 's closely approaching nose Sam maintained his ground , and appealed for confirmation .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 7]: `` Has he , Herman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 13]: `` I don ' reckon so , '' said Herman , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 4]: `` WHAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 13]: Penrod transferred his nose to the immediate vicinity of Herman 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 14]: `` You do n't reckon so , ` bo , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 10]: You better look out how you reckon around here !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 9]: YOU UNDERSTAN ' THAT , ` BO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 25]: Herman bore the eye-to-eye very well ; indeed , it seemed to please him , for he continued to laugh while Verman chuckled delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 29]: The brothers had been in the country picking berries for a week , and it happened that this was their first experience of the new manifestation of Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 11]: `` HAVE N'T I been up at the Third ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 5]: the sinister Penrod demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: `` I don ' reckon so .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 7]: How come you ast ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 14]: `` Did n't you just hear me SAY I been up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said Herman mischievously , `` hearin ' ai n't believin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 28]: Penrod clutched him by the back of the neck , but Herman , laughing loudly , ducked and released himself at once , retreating to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 7]: `` You take that back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 7]: Penrod shouted , striking out wildly .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 43]: `` Don ' git mad , '' begged the small darky , while a number of blows falling upon his warding arms failed to abate his amusement , and a sound one upon the cheek only made him laugh the more unrestrainedly .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 23]: He behaved exactly as if Penrod were tickling him , and his brother , Verman , rolled with joy in a wheelbarrow .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 13]: Penrod pummelled till he was tired , and produced no greater effect .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 6]: he panted , desisting finally .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 15]: `` NOW I reckon you know whether I been up there or not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 6]: Herman rubbed his smitten cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 4]: `` Pow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 3]: `` Pow-ee !
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 13]: You cert ` ny did lan ' me good one NAT time !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 2]: Oo-ee !
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 4]: she HURT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 22]: `` You 'll get hurt worse 'n that , '' Penrod assured him , `` if you stay around here much .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 11]: Rupe Collins is comin ' this afternoon , he said .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 17]: We 're goin ' to make some policemen 's billies out of the rake handle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 13]: `` You go ' spoil new rake you ' pa bought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 6]: `` What do WE care ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 13]: I and Rupe got to have billies , have n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 7]: `` How you make 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 20]: `` Melt lead and pour in a hole we 're goin ' to make in the end of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 24]: Then we 're goin ' to carry 'em in our pockets , and if anybody says anything to us -- OH , oh !
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 3]: look out !
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 15]: They wo n't get a crack on the head -- OH , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 8]: `` When 's Rupe Collins coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 6]: Sam Williams inquired rather uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 25]: He had heard a great deal too much of this personage , but as yet the pleasure of actual acquaintance had been denied him .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 14]: `` He 's liable to be here any time , '' answered Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 6]: `` You better look out .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 18]: You 'll be lucky if you get home alive , if you stay till HE comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 14]: `` I ai n't afraid of him , '' Sam returned , conventionally .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 7]: `` You are , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: -LRB- There was some truth in the retort . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 21]: `` There ai n't any boy in this part of town but me that would n't be afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 9]: You 'd be afraid to talk to him .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 35]: You would n't get a word out of your mouth before old Rupie 'd have you where you 'd wished you never come around HIM , lettin ' on like you was so much !
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 14]: YOU would n't run home yellin ' ` Mom-muh ' or nothin ' !
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 5]: OH , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 6]: `` Who Rupe Collins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 4]: asked Herman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 7]: ` Who Rupe Collins ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 37]: Penrod mocked , and used his rasping laugh , but , instead of showing fright , Herman appeared to think he was meant to laugh , too ; and so he did , echoed by Verman .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 37]: `` You just hang around here a little while longer , '' Penrod added , grimly , `` and you 'll find out who Rupe Collins is , and I pity YOU when you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 8]: `` What he go ' do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 9]: `` You 'll see ; that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 32]: You just wait and -- '' At this moment a brown hound ran into the stable through the alley door , wagged a greeting to Penrod , and fraternized with Duke .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 45]: The fat-faced boy appeared upon the threshold and gazed coldly about the little company in the carriage-house , whereupon the coloured brethren , ceasing from merriment , were instantly impassive , and Sam Williams moved a little nearer the door leading into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 14]: Obviously , Sam regarded the newcomer as a redoubtable if not ominous figure .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 54]: He was a head taller than either Sam or Penrod ; head and shoulders taller than Herman , who was short for his age ; and Verman could hardly be used for purposes of comparison at all , being a mere squat brown spot , not yet quite nine years on this planet .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 17]: And to Sam 's mind , the aspect of Mr. Collins realized Penrod 's portentous foreshadowings .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 31]: Upon the fat face there was an expression of truculent intolerance which had been cultivated by careful habit to such perfection that Sam 's heart sank at sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 34]: A somewhat enfeebled twin to this expression had of late often decorated the visage of Penrod , and appeared upon that ingenuous surface now , as he advanced to welcome the eminent visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 45]: The host swaggered toward the door with a great deal of shoulder movement , carelessly feinting a slap at Verman in passing , and creating by various means the atmosphere of a man who has contemptuously amused himself with underlings while awaiting an equal .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 7]: `` Hello , ` bo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 10]: Penrod said in the deepest voice possible to him .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 9]: `` Who you callin ' ` bo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 14]: was the ungracious response , accompanied by immediate action of a similar nature .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 20]: Rupe held Penrod 's head in the crook of an elbow and massaged his temples with a hard-pressing knuckle .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 31]: `` I was only in fun , Rupie , '' pleaded the sufferer , and then , being set free , `` Come here , Sam , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: Penrod laughed pityingly .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 12]: `` Pshaw , I ai n't goin ' to hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 4]: Come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 21]: Sam , maintaining his position near the other door , Penrod went to him and caught him round the neck .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 7]: `` Watch me , Rupie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 31]: Penrod called , and performed upon Sam the knuckle operation which he had himself just undergone , Sam submitting mechanically , his eyes fixed with increasing uneasiness upon Rupe Collins .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 21]: Sam had a premonition that something even more painful than Penrod 's knuckle was going to be inflicted upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 14]: `` THAT don ' hurt , '' said Penrod , pushing him away .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 9]: `` Yes , it does , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 5]: Sam rubbed his temple .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 3]: `` Puh !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 11]: It did n't hurt me , did it , Rupie ?
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 20]: Come on in , Rupe : show this baby where he 's got a wart on his finger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 11]: `` You showed me that trick , '' Sam objected .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 8]: `` You already did that to me .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 27]: You tried it twice this afternoon and I do n't know how many times before , only you were n't strong enough after the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 24]: Anyway , I know what it is , and I do n't -- '' `` Come on , Rupe , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 8]: `` Make the baby lick dirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 37]: At this bidding , Rupe approached , while Sam , still protesting , moved to the threshold of the outer door ; but Penrod seized him by the shoulders and swung him indoors with a shout .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: `` Little baby wants to run home to its Mom-muh !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 7]: Here he is , Rupie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 43]: Thereupon was Penrod 's treachery to an old comrade properly rewarded , for as the two struggled , Rupe caught each by the back of the neck , simultaneously , and , with creditable impartiality , forced both boys to their knees .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 5]: `` Lick dirt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 18]: he commanded , forcing them still forward , until their faces were close to the stable floor .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 9]: At this moment he received a real surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 32]: With a loud whack something struck the back of his head , and , turning , he beheld Verman in the act of lifting a piece of lath to strike again .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 6]: `` Em moys ome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 7]: said Verman , the Giant Killer .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 9]: `` He tongue-tie ' , '' Herman explained .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 10]: `` He say , let 'em boys alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 16]: Rupe addressed his host briefly : `` Chase them nigs out o ' here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 11]: `` Don ' call me nig , '' said Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 7]: `` I mine my own biznuss .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 7]: You let 'em boys alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 35]: Rupe strode across the still prostrate Sam , stepped upon Penrod , and , equipping his countenance with the terrifying scowl and protruded jaw , lowered his head to the level of Herman 's .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 14]: `` Nig , you 'll be lucky if you leave here alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 18]: And he leaned forward till his nose was within less than an inch of Herman 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 41]: It could be felt that something awful was about to happen , and Penrod , as he rose from the floor , suffered an unexpected twinge of apprehension and remorse : he hoped that Rupe would n't REALLY hurt Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 29]: A sudden dislike of Rupe and Rupe 's ways rose within him , as he looked at the big boy overwhelming the little darky with that ferocious scowl .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 22]: Penrod , all at once , felt sorry about something indefinable ; and , with equal vagueness , he felt foolish .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 31]: `` Come on , Rupe , '' he suggested , feebly , `` let Herman go , and let 's us make our billies out of the rake handle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 19]: The rake handle , however , was not available , if Rupe had inclined to favour the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 20]: Verman had discarded his lath for the rake , which he was at this moment lifting in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 37]: `` You ole black nigger , '' the fat-faced boy said venomously to Herman , `` I 'm agoin ' to -- '' But he had allowed his nose to remain too long near Herman 's .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 24]: Penrod 's familiar nose had been as close with only a ticklish spinal effect upon the not very remote descendant of Congo man-eaters .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 28]: The result produced by the glare of Rupe 's unfamiliar eyes , and by the dreadfully suggestive proximity of Rupe 's unfamiliar nose , was altogether different .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 34]: Herman 's and Verman 's Bangala great-grandfathers never considered people of their own jungle neighbourhood proper material for a meal , but they looked upon strangers especially truculent strangers -- as distinctly edible .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 45]: Penrod and Sam heard Rupe suddenly squawk and bellow ; saw him writhe and twist and fling out his arms like flails , though without removing his face from its juxtaposition ; indeed , for a moment , the two heads seemed even closer .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 9]: Then they separated -- and battle was on !
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 61]: CHAPTER XXIII COLOURED TROOPS IN ACTION How neat and pure is the task of the chronicler who has the tale to tell of a `` good rousing fight '' between boys or men who fight in the `` good old English way , '' according to a model set for fights in books long before Tom Brown went to Rugby .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 62]: There are seconds and rounds and rules of fair-play , and always there is great good feeling in the end -- though sometimes , to vary the model , `` the Butcher '' defeats the hero -- and the chronicler who stencils this fine old pattern on his page is certain of applause as the stirrer of `` red blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 6]: There is no surer recipe .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 24]: But when Herman and Verman set to ' t the record must be no more than a few fragments left by the expurgator .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 25]: It has been perhaps sufficiently suggested that the altercation in Mr. Schofield 's stable opened with mayhem in respect to the aggressor 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 33]: Expressing vocally his indignation and the extremity of his pained surprise , Mr. Collins stepped backward , holding his left hand over his nose , and striking at Herman with his right .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 8]: Then Verman hit him with the rake .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 5]: Verman struck from behind .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 8]: He struck as hard as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 35]: And he struck with the tines down -- For , in his simple , direct African way he wished to kill his enemy , and he wished to kill him as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 8]: That was his single , earnest purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 10]: On this account , Rupe Collins was peculiarly unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 20]: He was plucky and he enjoyed conflict , but neither his ambitions nor his anticipations had ever included murder .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 40]: He had not learned that an habitually aggressive person runs the danger of colliding with beings in one of those lower stages of evolution wherein theories about `` hitting below the belt '' have not yet made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 19]: The rake glanced from the back of Rupe 's head to his shoulder , but it felled him .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 66]: Both darkies jumped full upon him instantly , and the three rolled and twisted upon the stable-floor , unloosing upon the air sincere maledictions closely connected with complaints of cruel and unusual treatment ; while certain expressions of feeling presently emanating from Herman and Verman indicated that Rupe Collins , in this extremity , was proving himself not too slavishly addicted to fighting by rule .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 12]: Dan and Duke , mistaking all for mirth , barked gayly .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 46]: From the panting , pounding , yelling heap issued words and phrases hitherto quite unknown to Penrod and Sam ; also , a hoarse repetition in the voice of Rupe concerning his ear left it not to be doubted that additional mayhem was taking place .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 21]: Appalled , the two spectators retreated to the doorway nearest the yard , where they stood dumbly watching the cataclysm .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 40]: The struggle increased in primitive simplicity : time and again the howling Rupe got to his knees only to go down again as the earnest brothers , in their own way , assisted him to a more reclining position .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 36]: Primal forces operated here , and the two blanched , slightly higher products of evolution , Sam and Penrod , no more thought of interfering than they would have thought of interfering with an earthquake .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 14]: At last , out of the ruck rose Verman , disfigured and maniacal .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 30]: With a wild eye he looked about him for his trusty rake ; but Penrod , in horror , had long since thrown the rake out into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 12]: Naturally , it had not seemed necessary to remove the lawn-mower .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 18]: The frantic eye of Verman fell upon the lawn-mower , and instantly he leaped to its handle .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 23]: Shrilling a wordless war-cry , he charged , propelling the whirling , deafening knives straight upon the prone legs of Rupe Collins .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 28]: The lawn-mower was sincerely intended to pass longitudinally over the body of Mr. Collins from heel to head ; and it was the time for a death-song .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 8]: Black Valkyrie hovered in the shrieking air .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 7]: `` Cut his gizzud out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 9]: shrieked Herman , urging on the whirling knives .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 39]: They touched and lacerated the shin of Rupe , as , with the supreme agony of effort a creature in mortal peril puts forth before succumbing , he tore himself free of Herman and got upon his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 6]: Herman was up as quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 13]: He leaped to the wall and seized the garden-scythe that hung there .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 23]: `` I 'm go to cut you ' gizzud out , '' he announced definitely , `` an ' eat it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 32]: Rupe Collins had never run from anybody -LRB- except his father -RRB- in his life ; he was not a coward ; but the present situation was very , very unusual .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 56]: He was already in a badly dismantled condition , and yet Herman and Verman seemed discontented with their work : Verman was swinging the grass-cutter about for a new charge , apparently still wishing to mow him , and Herman had made a quite plausible statement about what he intended to do with the scythe .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 57]: Rupe paused but for an extremely condensed survey of the horrible advance of the brothers , and then , uttering a blood-curdled scream of fear , ran out of the stable and up the alley at a speed he had never before attained , so that even Dan had hard work to keep within barking distance .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 84]: And a ` cross-shoulder glance , at the corner , revealing Verman and Herman in pursuit , the latter waving his scythe overhead , Mr. Collins slackened not his gait , but , rather , out of great anguish , increased it ; the while a rapidly developing purpose became firm in his mind -- and ever after so remained -- not only to refrain from visiting that neighbourhood again , but never by any chance to come within a mile of it .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 17]: From the alley door , Penrod and Sam watched the flight , and were without words .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 28]: When the pursuit rounded the corner , the two looked wanly at each other , but neither spoke until the return of the brothers from the chase .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 10]: Herman and Verman came back , laughing and chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 4]: `` Hiyi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 18]: cackled Herman to Verman , as they came , `` See ` at ole boy run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 4]: `` Who-ee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 5]: Verman shouted in ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 12]: `` Nev ' did see boy run so fas ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 10]: Herman continued , tossing the scythe into the wheelbarrow .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 12]: `` I bet he home in bed by viss time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 42]: Verman roared with delight , appearing to be wholly unconscious that the lids of his right eye were swollen shut and that his attire , not too finical before the struggle , now entitled him to unquestioned rank as a sansculotte .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 15]: Herman was a similar ruin , and gave as little heed to his condition .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 11]: Penrod looked dazedly from Herman to Verman and back again .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 5]: So did Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 27]: `` Herman , '' said Penrod , in a weak voice , `` you would n't HONEST of cut his gizzard out , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 2]: Me ?
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 5]: I don ' know .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 7]: He mighty mean ole boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 25]: Herman shook his head gravely , and then , observing that Verman was again convulsed with unctuous merriment , joined laughter with his brother .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 4]: `` Sho ' !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: I guess I uz dess TALKIN ' whens I said ` at !
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 17]: Reckon he thought I meant it , f 'm de way he tuck an ' run .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 2]: Hiyi !
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 8]: Reckon he thought ole Herman bad man !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 4]: No , suh !
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 14]: I uz dess talkin ' , 'cause I nev ' would cut NObody !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: I ain ' tryin ' git in no jail -- NO , suh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 11]: Penrod looked at the scythe : he looked at Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 12]: He looked at the lawn-mower , and he looked at Verman .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 11]: Then he looked out in the yard at the rake .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 5]: So did Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 10]: `` Come on , Verman , '' said Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 15]: `` We ain ' go ' ` at stove-wood f ' supper yit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 14]: Giggling reminiscently , the brothers disappeared leaving silence behind them in the carriage-house .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 37]: Penrod and Sam retired slowly into the shadowy interior , each glancing , now and then , with a preoccupied air , at the open , empty doorway where the late afternoon sunshine was growing ruddy .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 17]: At intervals one or the other scraped the floor reflectively with the side of his shoe .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 25]: Finally , still without either having made any effort at conversation , they went out into the yard and stood , continuing their silence .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 23]: `` Well , '' said Sam , at last , `` I guess it 's time I better be gettin ' home .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 6]: So long , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 12]: `` So long , Sam , '' said Penrod , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 12]: With a solemn gaze he watched his friend out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 34]: Then he went slowly into the house , and after an interval occupied in a unique manner , appeared in the library , holding a pair of brilliantly gleaming shoes in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 16]: Mr. Schofield , reading the evening paper , glanced frowningly over it at his offspring .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 9]: `` Look , papa , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 27]: `` I found your shoes where you 'd taken 'em off in your room , to put on your slippers , and they were all dusty .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 16]: So I took 'em out on the back porch and gave 'em a good blacking .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 10]: They shine up fine , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'll be d-dud-dummed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 6]: said the startled Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: Penrod was zigzagging back to normal .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 54]: CHAPTER XXIV `` LITTLE GENTLEMAN '' The midsummer sun was stinging hot outside the little barber-shop next to the corner drug store and Penrod , undergoing a toilette preliminary to his very slowly approaching twelfth birthday , was adhesive enough to retain upon his face much hair as it fell from the shears .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 57]: There is a mystery here : the tonsorial processes are not unagreeable to manhood ; in truth , they are soothing ; but the hairs detached from a boy 's head get into his eyes , his ears , his nose , his mouth , and down his neck , and he does everywhere itch excruciatingly .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 35]: Wherefore he blinks , winks , weeps , twitches , condenses his countenance , and squirms ; and perchance the barber 's scissors clip more than intended -- belike an outlying flange of ear .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 8]: `` Um -- muh -- OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 8]: said Penrod , this thing having happened .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 11]: `` D' I touch y ' up a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 7]: inquired the barber , smiling falsely .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 6]: `` Ooh -- UH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 17]: The boy in the chair offered inarticulate protest , as the wound was rubbed with alum .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 7]: `` THAT do n't hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 4]: said the barber .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 41]: `` You WILL get it , though , if you do n't sit stiller , '' he continued , nipping in the bud any attempt on the part of his patient to think that he already had `` it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 4]: `` Pfuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 18]: said Penrod , meaning no disrespect , but endeavoring to dislodge a temporary moustache from his lip .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 21]: `` You ought to see how still that little Georgie Bassett sits , '' the barber went on , reprovingly .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 14]: `` I hear everybody says he 's the best boy in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 3]: `` Pfuff !
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 3]: PHIRR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 10]: There was a touch of intentional contempt in this .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 31]: `` I have n't heard nobody around the neighbourhood makin ' no such remarks , '' added the barber , `` about nobody of the name of Penrod Schofield . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 20]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , clearing his mouth after a struggle , `` who wants 'em to ?
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 3]: Ouch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 25]: `` I hear they call Georgie Bassett the ` little gentleman , ' '' ventured the barber , provocatively , meeting with instant success .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 13]: `` They better not call ME that , '' returned Penrod truculently .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 9]: `` I 'd like to hear anybody try .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 7]: Just once , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 12]: I bet they 'd never try it ag -- OUCH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 8]: What 'd you do to 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 10]: `` It 's all right what I 'd DO !
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 17]: I bet they would n't want to call me that again long as they lived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 12]: `` What 'd you do if it was a little girl ?
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 10]: You would n't hit her , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'd -- Ouch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 13]: `` You would n't hit a little girl , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 30]: the barber persisted , gathering into his powerful fingers a mop of hair from the top of Penrod 's head and pulling that suffering head into an unnatural position .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 18]: `` Does n't the Bible say it ai n't never right to hit the weak sex ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 6]: SAY , look OUT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 19]: `` So you 'd go and punch a pore , weak , little girl , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 6]: said the barber , reprovingly .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 11]: `` Well , who said I 'd hit her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 5]: demanded the chivalrous Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 12]: `` I bet I 'd FIX her though , all right .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 5]: She 'd see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 12]: `` You would n't call her names , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 7]: `` No , I would n't !
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 10]: What hurt is it to call anybody names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 6]: `` Is that SO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 4]: exclaimed the barber .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 36]: `` Then you was intending what I heard you hollering at Fisher 's grocery delivery wagon driver fer a favour , the other day when I was goin ' by your house , was you ?
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 49]: I reckon I better tell him , because he says to me after-WERDS if he ever lays eyes on you when you ai n't in your own yard , he 's goin ' to do a whole lot o ' things you ai n't goin ' to like !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 11]: Yessir , that 's what he says to ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 17]: `` He better catch me first , I guess , before he talks so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 32]: `` Well , '' resumed the barber , `` that ai n't sayin ' what you 'd do if a young lady ever walked up and called you a little gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 13]: _ I _ want to hear what you 'd do to her .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: I guess I know , though -- come to think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 3]: demanded Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 28]: `` You 'd sick that pore ole dog of yours on her cat , if she had one , I expect , '' guessed the barber derisively .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 8]: `` No , I would not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 9]: `` Well , what WOULD you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: `` I 'd do enough .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 7]: Do n't worry about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 33]: `` Well , suppose it was a boy , then : what 'd you do if a boy come up to you and says , ` Hello , little gentleman ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 23]: `` He 'd be lucky , '' said Penrod , with a sinister frown , `` if he got home alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 11]: `` Suppose it was a boy twice your size ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 11]: `` Just let him try , '' said Penrod ominously .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 7]: `` You just let him try .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 12]: He 'd never see daylight again ; that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 64]: The barber dug ten active fingers into the helpless scalp before him and did his best to displace it , while the anguished Penrod , becoming instantly a seething crucible of emotion , misdirected his natural resentment into maddened brooding upon what he would do to a boy `` twice his size '' who should dare to call him `` little gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 56]: The barber shook him as his father had never shaken him ; the barber buffeted him , rocked him frantically to and fro ; the barber seemed to be trying to wring his neck ; and Penrod saw himself in staggering zigzag pictures , destroying large , screaming , fragmentary boys who had insulted him .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 32]: The torture stopped suddenly ; and clenched , weeping eyes began to see again , while the barber applied cooling lotions which made Penrod smell like a coloured housemaid 's ideal .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 34]: `` Now what , '' asked the barber , combing the reeking locks gently , `` what would it make you so mad fer , to have somebody call you a little gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 15]: It 's a kind of compliment , as it were , you might say .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 12]: What would you want to hit anybody fer THAT fer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 14]: To the mind of Penrod , this question was without meaning or reasonableness .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 34]: It was within neither his power nor his desire to analyze the process by which the phrase had become offensive to him , and was now rapidly assuming the proportions of an outrage .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 13]: He knew only that his gorge rose at the thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 9]: `` You just let 'em try it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 12]: he said threateningly , as he slid down from the chair .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 33]: And as he went out of the door , after further conversation on the same subject , he called back those warning words once more : `` Just let 'em try it !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 13]: Just once -- that 's all _ I _ ask 'em to .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 9]: They 'll find out what they GET ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 4]: The barber chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 28]: Then a fly lit on the barber 's nose and he slapped at it , and the slap missed the fly but did not miss the nose .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 5]: The barber was irritated .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 46]: At this moment his birdlike eye gleamed a gleam as it fell upon customers approaching : the prettiest little girl in the world , leading by the hand her baby brother , Mitchy-Mitch , coming to have Mitchy-Mitch 's hair clipped , against the heat .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 27]: It was a hot day and idle , with little to feed the mind -- and the barber was a mischievous man with an irritated nose .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: He did his worst .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 29]: Meanwhile , the brooding Penrod pursued his homeward way ; no great distance , but long enough for several one-sided conflicts with malign insulters made of thin air .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 9]: `` You better NOT call me that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 19]: `` You just try it , and you 'll get what other people got when THEY tried it .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 8]: You better not ack fresh with ME !
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 9]: Oh , you WILL , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 25]: He delivered a vicious kick full upon the shins of an iron fence-post , which suffered little , though Penrod instantly regretted his indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 4]: `` Oof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 19]: he grunted , hopping ; and went on after bestowing a look of awful hostility upon the fence-post .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 21]: `` I guess you 'll know better next time , '' he said , in parting , to this antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 24]: `` You just let me catch you around here again and I 'll -- '' His voice sank to inarticulate but ominous murmurings .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 7]: He was in a dangerous mood .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 36]: Nearing home , however , his belligerent spirit was diverted to happier interests by the discovery that some workmen had left a caldron of tar in the cross-street , close by his father 's stable .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 9]: He tested it , but found it inedible .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 28]: Also , as a substitute for professional chewing-gum it was unsatisfactory , being insufficiently boiled down and too thin , though of a pleasant , lukewarm temperature .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 13]: But it had an excess of one quality -- it was sticky .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 59]: It was the stickiest tar Penrod had ever used for any purposes whatsoever , and nothing upon which he wiped his hands served to rid them of it ; neither his polka-dotted shirt waist nor his knickerbockers ; neither the fence , nor even Duke , who came unthinkingly wagging out to greet him , and retired wiser .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 6]: Nevertheless , tar is tar .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 39]: Much can be done with it , no matter what its condition ; so Penrod lingered by the caldron , though from a neighbouring yard could be heard the voices of comrades , including that of Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 23]: On the ground about the caldron were scattered chips and sticks and bits of wood to the number of a great multitude .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 31]: Penrod mixed quantities of this refuse into the tar , and interested himself in seeing how much of it he could keep moving in slow swirls upon the ebon surface .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 9]: Other surprises were arranged for the absent workmen .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 16]: The caldron was almost full , and the surface of the tar near the rim .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 18]: Penrod endeavoured to ascertain how many pebbles and brickbats , dropped in , would cause an overflow .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 26]: Labouring heartily to this end , he had almost accomplished it , when he received the suggestion for an experiment on a much larger scale .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 33]: Embedded at the corner of a grassplot across the street was a whitewashed stone , the size of a small watermelon and serving no purpose whatever save the questionable one of decoration .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 24]: It was easily pried up with a stick ; though getting it to the caldron tested the full strength of the ardent labourer .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 48]: Instructed to perform such a task , he would have sincerely maintained its impossibility but now , as it was unbidden , and promised rather destructive results , he set about it with unconquerable energy , feeling certain that he would be rewarded with a mighty splash .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 30]: Perspiring , grunting vehemently , his back aching and all muscles strained , he progressed in short stages until the big stone lay at the base of the caldron .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 43]: He rested a moment , panting , then lifted the stone , and was bending his shoulders for the heave that would lift it over the rim , when a sweet , taunting voice , close behind him , startled him cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 10]: `` How do you do , LITTLE GENTLEMAN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 19]: Penrod squawked , dropped the stone , and shouted , `` Shut up , you dern fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: purely from instinct , even before his about-face made him aware who had so spitefully addressed him .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 5]: It was Marjorie Jones .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 35]: Always dainty , and prettily dressed , she was in speckless and starchy white to-day , and a refreshing picture she made , with the new-shorn and powerfully scented Mitchy-Mitch clinging to her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 17]: They had stolen up behind the toiler , and now stood laughing together in sweet merriment .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 56]: Since the passing of Penrod 's Rupe Collins period he had experienced some severe qualms at the recollection of his last meeting with Marjorie and his Apache behaviour ; in truth , his heart instantly became as wax at sight of her , and he would have offered her fair speech ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 22]: in Marjorie 's wonderful eyes there shone a consciousness of new powers for his undoing , and she denied him opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 6]: `` Oh , OH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 8]: she cried , mocking his pained outcry .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 11]: `` What a way for a LITTLE GENTLEMAN to talk !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 12]: Little gentleman do n't say wicked -- '' `` Marjorie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 13]: Penrod , enraged and dismayed , felt himself stung beyond all endurance .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 12]: Insult from her was bitterer to endure than from any other .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 10]: `` Do n't you call me that again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 8]: `` Why not , LITTLE GENTLEMAN ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 5]: He stamped his foot .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 6]: `` You better stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 12]: Marjorie sent into his furious face her lovely , spiteful laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 11]: `` Little gentleman , little gentleman , little gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 4]: she said deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 10]: `` How 's the little gentleman , this afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 6]: Hello , little gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 9]: Penrod , quite beside himself , danced eccentrically .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 5]: `` Dry up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 3]: he howled .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 14]: `` Dry up , dry up , dry up , dry UP ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 31]: Mitchy-Mitch shouted with delight and applied a finger to the side of the caldron -- a finger immediately snatched away and wiped upon a handkerchief by his fastidious sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 5]: ` Ittle gellamun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 3]: said Mitchy-Mitch .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 7]: `` You better look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 10]: Penrod whirled upon this small offender with grim satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 14]: Here was at least something male that could without dishonour be held responsible .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 21]: `` You say that again , and I 'll give you the worst -- '' `` You will NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 6]: snapped Marjorie , instantly vitriolic .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 23]: `` He 'll say just whatever he wants to , and he 'll say it just as MUCH as he wants to .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 8]: Say it again , Mitchy-Mitch ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 5]: ` Ittle gellamun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 4]: said Mitchy-Mitch promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 4]: `` Ow-YAH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 11]: Penrod 's tone-production was becoming affected by his mental condition .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 21]: `` You say that again , and I 'll -- '' `` Go on , Mitchy-Mitch , '' cried Marjorie .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 8]: `` He ca n't do a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 5]: He do n't DARE !
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 14]: Say it some more , Mitchy-Mitch -- say it a whole lot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 17]: Mitchy-Mitch , his small , fat face shining with confidence in his immunity , complied . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 5]: ` Ittle gellamun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 5]: he squeaked malevolently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 4]: ` Ittle gellamun !
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 4]: ` Ittle gellamun !
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 5]: ` Ittle gellamun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 36]: The desperate Penrod bent over the whitewashed rock , lifted it , and then -- outdoing Porthos , John Ridd , and Ursus in one miraculous burst of strength -- heaved it into the air .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 3]: Marjorie screamed .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 6]: But it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 18]: The big stone descended into the precise midst of the caldron and Penrod got his mighty splash .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 9]: It was far , far beyond his expectations .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 15]: Spontaneously there were grand and awful effects -- volcanic spectacles of nightmare and eruption .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 26]: A black sheet of eccentric shape rose out of the caldron and descended upon the three children , who had no time to evade it .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 23]: After it fell , Mitchy-Mitch , who stood nearest the caldron , was the thickest , though there was enough for all .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 12]: Br ` er Rabbit would have fled from any of them .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 27]: CHAPTER XXV TAR When Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch got their breath , they used it vocally ; and seldom have more penetrating sounds issued from human throats .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 23]: Coincidentally , Marjorie , quite baresark , laid hands upon the largest stick within reach and fell upon Penrod with blind fury .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 49]: He had the presence of mind to flee , and they went round and round the caldron , while Mitchy-Mitch feebly endeavoured to follow -- his appearance , in this pursuit , being pathetically like that of a bug fished out of an ink-well , alive but discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 26]: Attracted by the riot , Samuel Williams made his appearance , vaulting a fence , and was immediately followed by Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 10]: They stared incredulously at the extraordinary spectacle before them .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 5]: `` Little GEN-TIL-MUN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 16]: shrieked Marjorie , with a wild stroke that landed full upon Penrod 's tarry cap .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 4]: `` OOOCH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 3]: bleated Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 6]: `` It 's Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: shouted Sam Williams , recognizing him by the voice .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 10]: For an instant he had been in some doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 4]: exclaimed Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 7]: `` WHAT does this mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 15]: That was Georgie 's style , and had helped to win him his title .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 9]: Marjorie leaned , panting , upon her stick .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 11]: `` I cu-called -- uh -- him -- oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 14]: she sobbed -- `` I called him a lul-little -- oh -- gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 5]: And oh -- lul-look !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 3]: -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 5]: lul-look at my du-dress !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 11]: Lul-look at Mumitchy -- oh -- Mitch -- oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 28]: Unexpectedly , she smote again -- with results -- and then , seizing the indistinguishable hand of Mitchy-Mitch , she ran wailing homeward down the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: ` Little gentleman ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 11]: said Georgie Bassett , with some evidences of disturbed complacency .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 11]: `` Why , that 's what they call ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: `` Yes , and you ARE one , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 5]: shouted the maddened Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: `` But you better not let anybody call ME that !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 21]: I 've stood enough around here for one day , and you ca n't run over ME , Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 12]: Just you put that in your gizzard and smoke it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 24]: `` Anybody has a perfect right , '' said Georgie , with , dignity , `` to call a person a little gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 25]: There 's lots of names nobody ought to call , but this one 's a NICE -- '' `` You better look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 17]: Unavenged bruises were distributed all over Penrod , both upon his body and upon his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 26]: Driven by subtle forces , he had dipped his hands in catastrophe and disaster : it was not for a Georgie Bassett to beard him .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 7]: Penrod was about to run amuck .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 16]: `` I have n't called you a little gentleman , yet , '' said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 6]: `` I only said it .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 10]: Anybody 's got a right to SAY it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 5]: `` Not around ME !
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 23]: You just try it again and -- '' `` I shall say it , '' returned Georgie , `` all I please .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 40]: Anybody in this town has a right to SAY ` little gentleman ' -- '' Bellowing insanely , Penrod plunged his right hand into the caldron , rushed upon Georgie and made awful work of his hair and features .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: Alas , it was but the beginning !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 27]: Sam Williams and Maurice Levy screamed with delight , and , simultaneously infected , danced about the struggling pair , shouting frantically : `` Little gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 3]: Little gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: Sick him , Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 6]: Sick him , little gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 3]: Little gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 4]: Little gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 28]: The infuriated outlaw turned upon them with blows and more tar , which gave Georgie Bassett his opportunity and later seriously impaired the purity of his fame .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 20]: Feeling himself hopelessly tarred , he dipped both hands repeatedly into the caldron and applied his gatherings to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 18]: It was bringing coals to Newcastle , but it helped to assuage the just wrath of Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 48]: The four boys gave a fine imitation of the Laocoon group complicated by an extra figure frantic splutterings and chokings , strange cries and stranger words issued from this tangle ; hands dipped lavishly into the inexhaustible reservoir of tar , with more and more picturesque results .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 43]: The caldron had been elevated upon bricks and was not perfectly balanced ; and under a heavy impact of the struggling group it lurched and went partly over , pouring forth a Stygian tide which formed a deep pool in the gutter .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 27]: It was the fate of Master Roderick Bitts , that exclusive and immaculate person , to make his appearance upon the chaotic scene at this juncture .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 42]: All in the cool of a white `` sailor suit , '' he turned aside from the path of duty -- which led straight to the house of a maiden aunt -- and paused to hop with joy upon the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 32]: A repeated epithet continuously half panted , half squawked , somewhere in the nest of gladiators , caught his ear , and he took it up excitedly , not knowing why .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 5]: `` Little gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 11]: shouted Roderick , jumping up and down in childish glee .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 4]: `` Little gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 3]: Little gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 27]: Lit -- '' A frightful figure tore itself free from the group , encircled this innocent bystander with a black arm , and hurled him headlong .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 14]: Full length and flat on his face went Roderick into the Stygian pool .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 6]: The frightful figure was Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 36]: Instantly , the pack flung themselves upon him again , and , carrying them with him , he went over upon Roderick , who from that instant was as active a belligerent as any there .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 31]: Thus began the Great Tar Fight , the origin of which proved , afterward , so difficult for parents to trace , owing to the opposing accounts of the combatants .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 46]: Marjorie said Penrod began it ; Penrod said Mitchy-Mitch began it ; Sam Williams said Georgie Bassett began it ; Georgie and Maurice Levy said Penrod began it ; Roderick Bitts , who had not recognized his first assailant , said Sam Williams began it .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 7]: Nobody thought of accusing the barber .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 32]: But the barber did not begin it ; it was the fly on the barber 's nose that began it -- though , of course , something else began the fly .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 11]: Somehow , we never manage to hang the real offender .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 39]: The end came only with the arrival of Penrod 's mother , who had been having a painful conversation by telephone with Mrs. Jones , the mother of Marjorie , and came forth to seek an errant son .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 30]: It is a mystery how she was able to pick out her own , for by the time she got there his voice was too hoarse to be recognizable .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 12]: Mr. Schofield 's version of things was that Penrod was insane .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 10]: `` He 's a stark , raving lunatic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 19]: declared the father , descending to the library from a before-dinner interview with the outlaw , that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 19]: `` I 'd send him to military school , but I do n't believe they 'd take him .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 12]: Do you know WHY he says all that awfulness happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 31]: `` When Margaret and I were trying to scrub him , '' responded Mrs. Schofield wearily , `` he said ` everybody ' had been calling him names . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 5]: ` Names ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 5]: snorted her husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 5]: ` Little gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: THAT 'S the vile epithet they called him !
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 13]: And because of it he wrecks the peace of six homes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 3]: `` SH !
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 15]: Yes ; he told us about it , '' said Mrs. Schofield , moaning .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 18]: `` He told us several hundred times , I should guess , though I did n't count .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 17]: He 's got it fixed in his head , and we could n't get it out .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 12]: All we could do was to put him in the closet .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 14]: He 'd have gone out again after those boys if we had n't .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 11]: I do n't know WHAT to make of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 9]: `` He 's a mystery to ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 4]: said her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 17]: `` And he refuses to explain why he objects to being called ` little gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 20]: Says he 'd do the same thing -- and worse -- if anybody dared to call him that again .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 19]: He said if the President of the United States called him that he 'd try to whip him .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: How long did you have him locked up in the closet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 4]: `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 5]: said Mrs. Schofield warningly .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 98]: `` About two hours ; but I do n't think it softened his spirit at all , because when I took him to the barber 's to get his hair clipped again , on account of the tar in it , Sammy Williams and Maurice Levy were there for the same reason , and they just WHISPERED ` little gentleman , ' so low you could hardly hear them -- and Penrod began fighting with them right before me , and it was really all the barber and I could do to drag him away from them .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 22]: The barber was very kind about it , but Penrod -- '' `` I tell you he 's a lunatic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 19]: Mr. Schofield would have said the same thing of a Frenchman infuriated by the epithet `` camel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 7]: The philosophy of insult needs expounding .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 4]: `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 4]: said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 10]: `` It does seem a kind of frenzy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 17]: `` Why on earth should any sane person mind being called -- '' `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 4]: said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: `` It 's beyond ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 9]: `` What are you SH-ing me for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 5]: demanded Mr. Schofield explosively .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 4]: `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 4]: said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 15]: `` It 's Mr. Kinosling , the new rector of Saint Joseph 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 3]: `` SH !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 15]: On the front porch with Margaret ; he 's going to stay for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 13]: I do hope -- '' `` Bachelor , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 28]: `` OUR old minister was speaking of him the other day , '' said Mr. Schofield , `` and he did n't seem so terribly impressed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 3]: `` SH !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 22]: Yes ; about thirty , and of course so superior to most of Margaret 's friends -- boys home from college .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 17]: She thinks she likes young Robert Williams , I know -- but he laughs so much !
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 8]: Of course there is n't any comparison .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 33]: Mr. Kinosling talks so intellectually ; it 's a good thing for Margaret to hear that kind of thing , for a change and , of course , he 's very spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 9]: He seems very much interested in her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 5]: She paused to muse .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 14]: `` I think Margaret likes him ; he 's so different , too .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 46]: It 's the third time he 's dropped in this week , and I -- '' `` Well , '' said Mr. Schofield grimly , `` if you and Margaret want him to come again , you 'd better not let him see Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 18]: `` But he 's asked to see him ; he seems interested in meeting all the family .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 11]: And Penrod nearly always behaves fairly well at table . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 19]: She paused , and then put to her husband a question referring to his interview with Penrod upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 11]: `` Did you -- did you -- do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 8]: `` No , '' he answered gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 37]: `` No , I did n't , but -- '' He was interrupted by a violent crash of china and metal in the kitchen , a shriek from Della , and the outrageous voice of Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 52]: The well-informed Della , ill-inspired to set up for a wit , had ventured to address the scion of the house roguishly as `` little gentleman , '' and Penrod , by means of the rapid elevation of his right foot , had removed from her supporting hands a laden tray .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 18]: Both parents , started for the kitchen , Mr. Schofield completing his interrupted sentence on the way .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 8]: `` But I will , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 30]: The rite thus promised was hastily but accurately performed in that apartment most distant from the front porch ; and , twenty minutes later , Penrod descended to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 49]: The Rev. Mr. Kinosling had asked for the pleasure of meeting him , and it had been decided that the only course possible was to cover up the scandal for the present , and to offer an undisturbed and smiling family surface to the gaze of the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 54]: Scorched but not bowed , the smouldering Penrod was led forward for the social formulae simultaneously with the somewhat bleak departure of Robert Williams , who took his guitar with him , this time , and went in forlorn unconsciousness of the powerful forces already set in secret motion to be his allies .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 23]: The punishment just undergone had but made the haughty and unyielding soul of Penrod more stalwart in revolt ; he was unconquered .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 26]: Every time the one intolerable insult had been offered him , his resentment had become the hotter , his vengeance the more instant and furious .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 51]: And , still burning with outrage , but upheld by the conviction of right , he was determined to continue to the last drop of his blood the defense of his honour , whenever it should be assailed , no matter how mighty or august the powers that attacked it .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 11]: In all ways , he was a very sore boy .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 35]: During the brief ceremony of presentation , his usually inscrutable countenance wore an expression interpreted by his father as one of insane obstinacy , while Mrs. Schofield found it an incentive to inward prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 48]: The fine graciousness of Mr. Kinosling , however , was unimpaired by the glare of virulent suspicion given him by this little brother : Mr. Kinosling mistook it for a natural curiosity concerning one who might possibly become , in time , a member of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 27]: He patted Penrod upon the head , which was , for many reasons , in no condition to be patted with any pleasure to the patter .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 11]: Penrod felt himself in the presence of a new enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: `` How do you do , my little lad , '' said Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 10]: `` I trust we shall become fast friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 23]: To the ear of his little lad , it seemed he said , `` A trost we shall bick-home fawst frainds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 63]: Mr. Kinosling 's pronunciation was , in fact , slightly precious ; and , the little lad , simply mistaking it for some cryptic form of mockery of himself , assumed a manner and expression which argued so ill for the proposed friendship that Mrs. Schofield hastily interposed the suggestion of dinner , and the small procession went in to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 21]: `` It has been a delicious day , '' said Mr. Kinosling , presently ; `` warm but balmy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 13]: With a benevolent smile he addressed Penrod , who sat opposite him .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 20]: `` I suppose , little gentleman , you have been indulging in the usual outdoor sports of vacation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 13]: Penrod laid down his fork and glared , open-mouthed at Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 13]: `` You 'll have another slice of breast of the chicken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: Mr. Schofield inquired , loudly and quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 6]: `` A lovely day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 9]: exclaimed Margaret , with equal promptitude and emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: `` Lovely , oh , lovely !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 3]: Lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 8]: `` Beautiful , beautiful , beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 39]: said Mrs. Schofield , and after a glance at Penrod which confirmed her impression that he intended to say something , she continued , `` Yes , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 17]: Penrod closed his mouth and sank back in his chair -- and his relatives took breath .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 5]: Mr. Kinosling looked pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 17]: This responsive family , with its ready enthusiasm , made the kind of audience he liked .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 18]: He passed a delicate white hand gracefully over his tall , pale forehead , and smiled indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 10]: `` Youth relaxes in summer , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 18]: `` Boyhood is the age of relaxation ; one is playful , light , free , unfettered .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 14]: One runs and leaps and enjoys one 's self with one 's companions .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 34]: It is good for the little lads to play with their friends ; they jostle , push , and wrestle , and simulate little , happy struggles with one another in harmless conflict .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 6]: The young muscles are toughening .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 4]: It is good .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 8]: Boyish chivalry develops , enlarges , expands .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 9]: The young learn quickly , intuitively , spontaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 8]: They perceive the obligations of noblesse oblige .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 12]: They begin to comprehend the necessity of caste and its requirements .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 22]: They learn what birth means -- ah , -- that is , they learn what it means to be well born .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 24]: They learn courtesy in their games ; they learn politeness , consideration for one another in their pastimes , amusements , lighter occupations .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 30]: I make it my pleasure to join them often , for I sympathize with them in all their wholesome joys as well as in their little bothers and perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 26]: I understand them , you see ; and let me tell you it is no easy matter to understand the little lads and lassies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 35]: He sent to each listener his beaming glance , and , permitting it to come to rest upon Penrod , inquired : `` And what do you say to that , little gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 7]: Mr. Schofield uttered a stentorian cough .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 3]: `` More ?
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 8]: You 'd better have some more chicken !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 2]: More !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 3]: Do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 5]: `` More chicken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 4]: urged Margaret simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 4]: `` Do please !
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 2]: Please !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 2]: More !
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 2]: Do !
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 3]: More ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 10]: `` Beautiful , beautiful , '' began Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 27]: `` Beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful -- '' It is not known in what light Mr. Kinosling viewed the expression of Penrod 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 19]: Perhaps he mistook it for awe ; perhaps he received no impression at all of its extraordinary quality .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 44]: He was a rather self-engrossed young man , just then engaged in a double occupation , for he not only talked , but supplied from his own consciousness a critical though favourable auditor as well , which of course kept him quite busy .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 36]: Besides , it is oftener than is expected the case that extremely peculiar expressions upon the countenances of boys are entirely overlooked , and suggest nothing to the minds of people staring straight at them .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 30]: Certainly Penrod 's expression -- which , to the perception of his family , was perfectly horrible -- caused not the faintest perturbation in the breast of Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 11]: Mr. Kinosling waived the chicken , and continued to talk .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 19]: `` Yes , I think I may claim to understand boys , '' he said , smiling thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 10]: `` One has been a boy one 's self .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 8]: Ah , it is not all playtime !
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 37]: I hope our young scholar here does not overwork himself at his Latin , at his classics , as I did , so that at the age of eight years I was compelled to wear glasses .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 30]: He must be careful not to strain the little eyes at his scholar 's tasks , not to let the little shoulders grow round over his scholar 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 14]: Youth is golden ; we should keep it golden , bright , glistening .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 20]: Youth should frolic , should be sprightly ; it should play its cricket , its tennis , its hand-ball .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 37]: It should run and leap ; it should laugh , should sing madrigals and glees , carol with the lark , ring out in chanties , folk-songs , ballads , roundelays -- '' He talked on .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 50]: At any instant Mr. Schofield held himself ready to cough vehemently and shout , `` More chicken , '' to drown out Penrod in case the fatal words again fell from those eloquent lips ; and Mrs. Schofield and Margaret kept themselves prepared at all times to assist him .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 21]: So passed a threatening meal , which Mrs. Schofield hurried , by every means with decency , to its conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 28]: She felt that somehow they would all be safer out in the dark of the front porch , and led the way thither as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 9]: `` No cigar , I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 19]: Mr. Kinosling , establishing himself in a wicker chair beside Margaret , waved away her father 's proffer .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 6]: `` I do not smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 10]: I have never tasted tobacco in any form . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 15]: Mrs. Schofield was confirmed in her opinion that this would be an ideal son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 7]: Mr. Schofield was not so sure .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 6]: `` No tobacco for me .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 12]: No cigar , no pipe , no cigarette , no cheroot .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 13]: For me , a book -- a volume of poems , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 14]: Verses , rhymes , lines metrical and cadenced -- those are my dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 28]: Tennyson by preference : ` Maud , ' or ` Idylls of the King ' -- poetry of the sound Victorian days ; there is none later .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 10]: Or Longfellow will rest me in a tired hour .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 21]: Yes ; for me , a book , a volume in the hand , held lightly between the fingers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 36]: Mr. Kinosling looked pleasantly at his fingers as he spoke , waving his hand in a curving gesture which brought it into the light of a window faintly illumined from the interior of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 26]: Then he passed those graceful fingers over his hair , and turned toward Penrod , who was perched upon the railing in a dark corner .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 15]: `` The evening is touched with a slight coolness , '' said Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 16]: `` Perhaps I may request the little gentleman -- '' `` B'gr - r-RUFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 4]: coughed Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 12]: `` You 'd better change your mind about a cigar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 7]: `` No , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 18]: I was about to request the lit -- '' `` DO try one , '' Margaret urged .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 10]: `` I 'm sure papa 's are nice ones .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 11]: Do try -- '' `` No , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 17]: I remarked a slight coolness in the air , and my hat is in the hallway .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 20]: I was about to request -- '' `` I 'll get it for you , '' said Penrod suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 13]: `` If you will be so good , '' said Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 21]: `` It is a black bowler hat , little gentleman , and placed upon a table in the hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 8]: `` I know where it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 34]: Penrod entered the door , and a feeling of relief , mutually experienced , carried from one to another of his three relatives their interchanged congratulations that he had recovered his sanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 22]: ` The day is done , and the darkness , ' '' began Mr. Kinosling -- and recited that poem entire .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 65]: He followed it with `` The Children 's Hour , '' and after a pause , at the close , to allow his listeners time for a little reflection upon his rendition , he passed his handagain over his head , and called , in the direction of the doorway : `` I believe I will take my hat now , little gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 21]: `` Here it is , '' said Penrod , unexpectedly climbing over the porch railing , in the other direction .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 31]: His mother and father and Margaret had supposed him to be standing in the hallway out of deference , and because he thought it tactful not to interrupt the recitations .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 19]: All of them remembered , later , that this supposed thoughtfulness on his part struck them as unnatural .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 8]: `` Very good , little gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 27]: said Mr. Kinosling , and being somewhat chilled , placed the hat firmly upon his head , pulling it down as far as it would go .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 12]: It had a pleasant warmth , which he noticed at once .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 26]: The next instant , he noticed something else , a peculiar sensation of the scalp -- a sensation which he was quite unable to define .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 29]: He lifted his hand to take the hat off , and entered upon a strange experience : his hat seemed to have decided to remain where it was .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 14]: `` Do you like Tennyson as much as Longfellow , Mr. Kinosling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: inquired Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 15]: `` I -- ah -- I can not say , '' he returned absently .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 12]: `` I -- ah -- each has his own -- ugh !
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 29]: flavour and savour , each his -- ah -- ah -- '' Struck by a strangeness in his tone , she peered at him curiously through the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 20]: His outlines were indistinct , but she made out that his arms were , uplifted in a singular gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 9]: He seemed to be wrenching at his head .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 9]: `` Is -- is anything the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 4]: she asked anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 9]: `` Mr. Kinosling , are you ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 6]: `` Not at -- ugh !
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 13]: -- all , '' he replied , in the same odd tone .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 11]: `` I -- ah -- I believe -- UGH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 11]: He dropped his hands from his hat , and rose .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 6]: His manner was slightly agitated .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 14]: `` I fear I may have taken a trifling -- ah -- cold .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 14]: I should -- ah -- perhaps be -- ah -- better at home .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: I will -- ah -- say good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 46]: At the steps , he instinctively lifted his hand to remove his hat , but did not do so , and , saying `` Goodnight , '' again in a frigid voice , departed with visible stiffness from that house , to return no more .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 8]: `` Well , of all -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 6]: cried Mrs. Schofield , astounded .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 6]: `` What was the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 8]: He just went -- like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 6]: She made a flurried gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 17]: `` In heaven 's name , Margaret , what DID you say to him ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 5]: _ I _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 4]: exclaimed Margaret indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 5]: He just WENT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 17]: `` Why , he did n't even take off his hat when he said good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 4]: said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 22]: Margaret , who had crossed to the doorway , caught the ghost of a whisper behind her , where stood Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 8]: `` YOU BET HE DID N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 8]: He knew not that he was overheard .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 27]: A frightful suspicion flashed through Margaret 's mind -- a suspicion that Mr. Kinosling 's hat would have to be either boiled off or shaved off .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 17]: With growing horror she recalled Penrod 's long absence when he went to bring the hat .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 15]: `` Penrod , '' she cried , `` let me see your hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 24]: She had toiled at those hands herself late that afternoon , nearly scalding her own , but at last achieving a lily purity .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 8]: `` Let me see your hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 4]: She seized them .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 5]: Again they were tarred !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 39]: CHAPTER XXVI THE QUIET AFTERNOON Perhaps middle-aged people might discern Nature 's real intentions in the matter of pain if they would examine a boy 's punishments and sorrows , for he prolongs neither beyond their actual duration .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 14]: With a boy , trouble must be of Homeric dimensions to last overnight .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 12]: To him , every next day is really a new day .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 21]: Thus , Penrod woke , next morning , with neither the unspared rod , nor Mr. Kinosling in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 20]: Tar , itself , so far as his consideration of it went , might have been an undiscovered substance .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 52]: His mood was cheerful and mercantile ; some process having worked mysteriously within him , during the night , to the result that his first waking thought was of profits connected with the sale of old iron -- or perhaps a ragman had passed the house , just before he woke .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 26]: By ten o'clock he had formed a partnership with the indeed amiable Sam , and the firm of Schofield and Williams plunged headlong into commerce .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 74]: Heavy dealings in rags , paper , old iron and lead gave the firm a balance of twenty-two cents on the evening of the third day ; but a venture in glassware , following , proved disappointing on account of the scepticism of all the druggists in that part of town , even after seven laborious hours had been spent in cleansing a wheelbarrow-load of old medicine bottles with hydrant water and ashes .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 57]: Likewise , the partners were disheartened by their failure to dispose of a crop of `` greens , '' although they had uprooted specimens of that decorative and unappreciated flower , the dandelion , with such persistence and energy that the Schofields ' and Williams ' lawns looked curiously haggard for the rest of that summer .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 10]: The fit passed : business languished ; became extinct .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: The dog-days had set in .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 13]: One August afternoon was so hot that even boys sought indoor shade .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 28]: In the dimness of the vacant carriage-house of the stable , lounged Masters Penrod Schofield , Samuel Williams , Maurice Levy , Georgie Bassett , and Herman .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 6]: They sat still and talked .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 25]: It is a hot day , in rare truth , when boys devote themselves principally to conversation , and this day was that hot .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 7]: Their elders should beware such days .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: Peril hovers near when the fierceness of weather forces inaction and boys in groups are quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 26]: The more closely volcanoes , Western rivers , nitroglycerin , and boys are pent , the deadlier is their action at the point of outbreak .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 29]: Thus , parents and guardians should look for outrages of the most singular violence and of the most peculiar nature during the confining weather of February and August .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 16]: The thing which befell upon this broiling afternoon began to brew and stew peacefully enough .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 14]: All was innocence and languor ; no one could have foretold the eruption .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: They were upon their great theme : `` When I get to be a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 18]: Being human , though boys , they considered their present estate too commonplace to be dwelt upon .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 19]: So , when the old men gather , they say : `` When I was a boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 12]: It really is the land of nowadays that we never discover .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 53]: `` When I 'm a man , '' said Sam Williams , `` I 'm goin ' to hire me a couple of coloured waiters to swing me in a hammock and keep pourin ' ice-water on me all day out o ' those waterin ' - cans they sprinkle flowers from .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 12]: I 'll hire you for one of 'em , Herman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 15]: `` No ; you ain ' goin ' to , '' said Herman promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: `` You ain ' no flowuh .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 9]: But nev ' min ' nat , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 15]: Ain ' nobody goin ' haih me whens _ I _ 'm a man .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 7]: Goin ' be my own boss .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 14]: _ I _ 'm go ' be a rai ` road man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 17]: `` You mean like a superintendent , or sumpthing like that , and sell tickets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 3]: asked Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 11]: `` Sup ` in -- nev ' min ' nat !
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 3]: Sell ticket ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 3]: NO suh !
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 8]: Go ' be a PO ` tuh !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 9]: My uncle a po ` tuh right now .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 9]: Solid gole buttons -- oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 14]: `` Generals get a lot more buttons than porters , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 19]: `` Generals -- '' `` Po ` tuhs make the bes ' l'vin ' , '' Herman interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 16]: `` My uncle spen ' mo ' money 'n any white man n'is town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 24]: `` Well , I rather be a general , '' said Penrod , `` or a senator , or sumpthing like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 13]: `` Senators live in Warshington , '' Maurice Levy contributed the information .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 5]: `` I been there .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 19]: Warshington ai n't so much ; Niag ` ra Falls is a hundred times as good as Warshington .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 12]: So 's ` Tlantic City , I was there , too .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: I been everywhere there is .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 66]: I -- '' `` Well , anyway , '' said Sam Williams , raising his voice in order to obtain the floor , `` anyway , I 'm goin ' to lay in a hammock all day , and have ice-water sprinkled on top o ' me , and I 'm goin ' to lay there all night , too , and the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 16]: I 'm goin ' to lay there a couple o ' years , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 8]: `` I bet you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 3]: exclaimed Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 9]: `` What 'd you do in winter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 27]: `` What you goin ' to do when it 's winter , out in a hammock with water sprinkled on top o ' you all day ?
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 41]: I bet you -- '' `` I 'd stay right there , '' Sam declared , with strong conviction , blinking as he looked out through the open doors at the dazzling lawn and trees , trembling in the heat .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 11]: `` They could n't sprinkle too much for ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 22]: `` It 'd make icicles all over you , and -- '' `` I wish it would , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 8]: `` I 'd eat 'em up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 12]: `` And it 'd snow on you -- '' `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 12]: I 'd swaller it as fast as it 'd come down .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 12]: I wish I had a BARREL o ' snow right now .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 10]: I wish this whole barn was full of it .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 17]: I wish they was n't anything in the whole world except just good ole snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 18]: Penrod and Herman rose and went out to the hydrant , where they drank long and ardently .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 10]: Sam was still talking about snow when they returned .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 11]: `` No , I would n't just roll in it .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 15]: I 'd stick it all round inside my clo'es , and fill my hat .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 58]: No , I 'd freeze a big pile of it all hard , and I 'd roll her out flat and then I 'd carry her down to some ole tailor 's and have him make me a SUIT out of her , and -- '' `` Ca n't you keep still about your ole snow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 4]: demanded Penrod petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 23]: `` Makes me so thirsty I ca n't keep still , and I 've drunk so much now I bet I bust .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 11]: That ole hydrant water 's mighty near hot anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 20]: `` I 'm goin ' to have a big store , when I grow up , '' volunteered Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 5]: `` Candy store ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 3]: asked Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 5]: `` NO , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 15]: I 'll have candy in it , but not to eat , so much .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 38]: It 's goin ' to be a deportment store : ladies ' clothes , gentlemen 's clothes , neckties , china goods , leather goods , nice lines in woollings and lace goods -- '' `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 16]: I would n't give a five-for-a-cent marble for your whole store , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 7]: `` Would you , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 14]: `` Not for ten of 'em ; not for a million of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 14]: _ I _ 'm goin ' to have -- '' `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 3]: clamoured Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 24]: `` You 'd be foolish , because they 'd be a toy deportment in my store where they 'd be a hunderd marbles !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 13]: So , how much would you think your five-for-a-cent marble counts for ?
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 17]: And when I 'm keepin ' my store I 'm goin ' to get married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 4]: `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 4]: shrieked Sam derisively .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 3]: `` MARRIED !
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 3]: Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: Penrod and Herman joined in the howl of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 12]: `` Certumly I 'll get married , '' asserted Maurice stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 9]: `` I 'll get married to Marjorie Jones .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 13]: She likes me awful good , and I 'm her beau . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 8]: `` What makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 7]: inquired Penrod in a cryptic voice .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 15]: `` Because she 's my beau , too , '' came the prompt answer .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 18]: `` I 'm her beau because she 's my beau ; I guess that 's plenty reason !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 17]: I 'll get married to her as soon as I get my store running nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 16]: Penrod looked upon him darkly , but , for the moment , held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 4]: `` Married ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 4]: jeered Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 6]: `` Married to Marjorie Jones !
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 16]: You 're the only boy I ever heard say he was going to get married .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 44]: I would n't get married for -- why , I would n't for -- for -- '' Unable to think of any inducement the mere mention of which would not be ridiculously incommensurate , he proceeded : `` I would n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 8]: What you want to get married for ?
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 20]: What do married people do , except just come home tired , and worry around and kind of scold ?
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 15]: You better not do it , M'rice ; you 'll be mighty sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 13]: `` Everybody gets married , '' stated Maurice , holding his ground .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: `` They got ta . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 11]: `` I 'll bet _ I _ do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 4]: Sam returned hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 13]: `` They better catch me before they tell ME I have to .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 15]: Anyway , I bet nobody has to get married unless they want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 10]: `` They do , too , '' insisted Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 6]: `` They GOT TA ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 6]: `` Who told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 11]: `` Look at what my own papa told me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 7]: cried Maurice , heated with argument .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 28]: `` Did n't he tell me your papa had to marry your mamma , or else he never 'd got to handle a cent of her money ?
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 7]: Certumly , people got ta marry .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 2]: Everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 19]: You do n't know anybody over twenty years old that is n't married -- except maybe teachers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 6]: `` Look at policemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 4]: shouted Sam triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 21]: `` You do n't s ` pose anybody can make policemen get married , I reckon , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: `` Well , policemen , maybe , '' Maurice was forced to admit .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 14]: `` Policemen and teachers do n't , but everybody else got ta . ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 13]: `` Well , I 'll be a policeman , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 18]: `` THEN I guess they wo n't come around tellin ' me I have to get married .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 10]: What you goin ' to be , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 10]: `` Chief police , '' said the laconic Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 5]: `` What you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 7]: Sam inquired of quiet Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 18]: `` I am going to be , '' said Georgie , consciously , `` a minister . ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 14]: This announcement created a sensation so profound that it was followed by silence .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 7]: Herman was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 6]: `` You mean preachuh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 4]: he asked incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: `` You go ' PREACH ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' answered Georgie , looking like Saint Cecilia at the organ .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 4]: Herman was impressed .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 10]: `` You know all ` at preachuh talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 13]: `` I 'm going to learn it , '' said Georgie simply .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: `` How loud kin you holler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 4]: asked Herman doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 14]: `` He ca n't holler at all , '' Penrod interposed with scorn .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 7]: `` He hollers like a girl .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 9]: He 's the poorest hollerer in town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 5]: Herman shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 12]: Evidently he thought Georgie 's chance of being ordained very slender .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 21]: Nevertheless , a final question put to the candidate by the coloured expert seemed to admit one ray of hope .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 10]: `` How good kin you clim a pole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 15]: `` He ca n't climb one at all , '' Penrod answered for Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 30]: `` Over at Sam 's turning-pole you ought to see him try to -- '' `` Preachers do n't have to climb poles , '' Georgie said with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 9]: `` GOOD ones do , '' declared Herman .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 23]: `` Bes ' one ev ' _ I _ hear , he clim up an ' down same as a circus man .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 35]: One n'em big ` vivals outen whens we livin ' on a fahm , preachuh clim big pole right in a middle o ' the church , what was to hol ' roof up .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 27]: He clim way high up , an ' holler : ` Goin ' to heavum , goin ' to heavum , goin ' to heavum NOW .

Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 31]: An ' he slide down little , an ' holler : ` Devil 's got a hol ' o ' my coat-tails ; devil tryin ' to drag me down !
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 5]: Sinnuhs , take wawnun !

Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 24]: Herman possessed that extraordinary facility for vivid acting which is the great native gift of his race , and he enchained his listeners .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 6]: They sat fascinated and spellbound .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 8]: `` Herman , tell that again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 5]: said Penrod , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 41]: Herman , nothing loath , accepted the encore and repeated the Miltonic episode , expanding it somewhat , and dwelling with a fine art upon those portions of the narrative which he perceived to be most exciting to his audience .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 30]: Plainly , they thrilled less to Paradise gained than to its losing , and the dreadful climax of the descent into the Pit was the greatest treat of all .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 7]: The effect was immense and instant .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 6]: Penrod sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 17]: `` Georgie Bassett could n't do that to save his life , '' he declared . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 11]: _ I _ 'm goin ' to be a preacher !
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 15]: I 'D be all right for one , would n't I , Herman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 6]: `` So am I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 5]: Sam Williams echoed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 11]: `` I guess I can do it if YOU can .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 14]: I 'd be better 'n Penrod , would n't I , Herman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 7]: `` I am , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 3]: Maurice shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 49]: `` I got a stronger voice than anybody here , and I 'd like to know what -- '' The three clamoured together indistinguishably , each asserting his qualifications for the ministry according to Herman 's theory , which had been accepted by these sudden converts without question .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 6]: `` Listen to ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 16]: Maurice bellowed , proving his claim to at least the voice by drowning the others .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 19]: `` Maybe I ca n't climb a pole so good , but who can holler louder 'n this ?
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 5]: Listen to ME-E-E ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 5]: `` Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 5]: cried Penrod , irritated .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 10]: `` Go to heaven ; go to hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 4]: `` Oo-o-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: exclaimed Georgie Bassett , profoundly shocked .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 17]: Sam and Maurice , awed by Penrod 's daring , ceased from turmoil , staring wide-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 7]: `` You cursed and swore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 3]: said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 6]: `` I did not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 5]: cried Penrod , hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 7]: `` That is n't swearing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 13]: `` You said , ` Go to a big H ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 3]: said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 5]: `` I did not !
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 16]: I said , ` Go to heaven , ' before I said a big H .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 10]: That is n't swearing , is it , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 14]: It 's almost what the preacher said , ai n't it , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 26]: It ai n't swearing now , any more -- not if you put ` go to heaven ' with it , is it , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 26]: You can say it all you want to , long as you say ` go to heaven ' first , CA N'T you , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 16]: Anybody can say it if the preacher says it , ca n't they , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 17]: I guess I know when I ai n't swearing , do n't I , Herman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 17]: Judge Herman ruled for the defendant , and Penrod was considered to have carried his point .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 34]: With fine consistency , the conclave established that it was proper for the general public to `` say it , '' provided `` go to heaven '' should in all cases precede it .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 64]: This prefix was pronounced a perfect disinfectant , removing all odour of impiety or insult ; and , with the exception of Georgie Bassett -LRB- who maintained that the minister 's words were `` going '' and `` gone , '' not `` go '' -RRB- , all the boys proceeded to exercise their new privilege so lavishly that they tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 52]: But there was no diminution of evangelical ardour ; again were heard the clamours of dispute as to which was the best qualified for the ministry , each of the claimants appealing passionately to Herman , who , pleased but confused , appeared to be incapable of arriving at a decision .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 11]: During a pause , Georgie Bassett asserted his prior rights .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 13]: `` Who said it first , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 17]: `` I was going to be a minister from long back of to-day , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 23]: And I guess I said I was going to be a minister right to-day before any of you said anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 6]: DID N'T I , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 10]: YOU heard me , did n't you , Herman ?
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 18]: That 's the very thing started you talking about it , was n't it , Herman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 9]: `` You ' right , '' said Herman .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 11]: `` You the firs ' one to say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 12]: Penrod , Sam , and Maurice immediately lost faith in Herman .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 10]: `` What if you did say it first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 3]: Penrod shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 16]: `` You could n't BE a minister if you were a hunderd years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 16]: `` I bet his mother would n't let him be one , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 9]: `` She never lets him do anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 10]: `` She would , too , '' retorted Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 21]: `` Ever since I was little , she -- '' `` He 's too sissy to be a preacher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 3]: cried Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 8]: `` Listen at his squeaky voice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 23]: `` I 'm going to be a better minister , '' shouted Georgie , `` than all three of you put together .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 10]: I could do it with my left hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 7]: The three laughed bitingly in chorus .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 25]: They jeered , derided , scoffed , and raised an uproar which would have had its effect upon much stronger nerves than Georgie 's .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 20]: For a time he contained his rising choler and chanted monotonously , over and over : `` I COULD !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 5]: I COULD , TOO !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 3]: I COULD !
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 6]: I COULD , TOO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 27]: But their tumult wore upon him , and he decided to avail himself of the recent decision whereby a big H was rendered innocuous and unprofane .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 20]: Having used the expression once , he found it comforting , and substituted it for : `` I could !
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 6]: I could , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 7]: But it relieved him only temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 20]: His tormentors were unaffected by it and increased their howlings , until at last Georgie lost his head altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 30]: Badgered beyond bearing , his eyes shining with a wild light , he broke through the besieging trio , hurling little Maurice from his path with a frantic hand .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 7]: `` I 'll show you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 8]: he cried , in this sudden frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 16]: `` You give me a chance , and I 'll prove it right NOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 8]: `` That 's talkin ' business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 3]: shouted Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 7]: `` Everybody keep still a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 3]: Everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 18]: He took command of the situation at once , displaying a fine capacity for organization and system .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 50]: It needed only a few minutes to set order in the place of confusion and to determine , with the full concurrence of all parties , the conditions under which Georgie Bassett was to defend his claim by undergoing what may be perhaps intelligibly defined as the Herman test .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 8]: Georgie declared he could do it easily .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 29]: He was in a state of great excitement and in no condition to think calmly or , probably , he would not have made the attempt at all .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: Certainly he was overconfident .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 58]: CHAPTER XXVII CONCLUSION OF THE QUIET AFTERNOON It was during the discussion of the details of this enterprise that Georgie 's mother , a short distance down the street , received a few female callers , who came by appointment to drink a glass of iced tea with her , and to meet the Rev. Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 19]: Mr. Kinosling was proving almost formidably interesting to the women and girls of his own and other flocks .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 26]: What favour of his fellow clergymen a slight precociousness of manner and pronunciation cost him was more than balanced by the visible ecstasies of ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 6]: They blossomed at his touch .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 37]: He had just entered Mrs. Bassett 's front door , when the son of the house , followed by an intent and earnest company of four , opened the alley gate and came into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 16]: The unconscious Mrs. Bassett was about to have her first experience of a fatal coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 25]: It was her first , because she was the mother of a boy so well behaved that he had become a proverb of transcendency .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 30]: Fatal coincidences were plentiful in the Schofield and Williams families , and would have been familiar to Mrs. Bassett had Georgie been permitted greater intimacy with Penrod and Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 13]: Mr. Kinosling sipped his iced tea and looked about , him approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 17]: Seven ladies leaned forward , for it was to be seen that he meant to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 32]: `` This cool room is a relief , '' he said , waving a graceful hand in a neatly limited gesture , which everybody 's eyes followed , his own included .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 9]: `` It is a relief and a retreat .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 15]: The windows open , the blinds closed -- that is as it should be .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 16]: It is a retreat , a fastness , a bastion against the heat 's assault .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 26]: For me , a quiet room -- a quiet room and a book , a volume in the hand , held lightly between the fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 16]: A volume of poems , lines metrical and cadenced ; something by a sound Victorian .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 7]: We have no later poets . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 4]: `` Swinburne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 8]: suggested Miss Beam , an eager spinster .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 6]: `` Swinburne , Mr. Kinosling ?
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 5]: Ah , SWINBURNE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 10]: `` Not Swinburne , '' said Mr. Kinosling chastely .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 8]: That concluded all the remarks about Swinburne .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 22]: Miss Beam retired in confusion behind another lady ; and somehow there became diffused an impression that Miss Beam was erotic .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 17]: `` I do not observe your manly little son , '' Mr. Kinosling addressed his hostess .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 14]: `` He 's out playing in the yard , '' Mrs. Bassett returned .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 12]: `` I heard his voice just now , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 14]: `` Everywhere I hear wonderful report of him , '' said Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 28]: `` I may say that I understand boys , and I feel that he is a rare , a fine , a pure , a lofty spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 16]: I say spirit , for spirit is the word I hear spoken of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 19]: A chorus of enthusiastic approbation affirmed the accuracy of this proclamation , and Mrs. Bassett flushed with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 30]: Georgie 's spiritual perfection was demonstrated by instances of it , related by the visitors ; his piety was cited , and wonderful things he had said were quoted .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 64]: `` Not all boys are pure , of fine spirit , of high mind , '' said Mr. Kinosling , and continued with true feeling : `` You have a neighbour , dear Mrs. Bassett , whose household I indeed really feel it quite impossible to visit until such time when better , firmer , stronger handed , more determined discipline shall prevail .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 21]: I find Mr. and Mrs. Schofield and their daughter charming -- '' Three or four ladies said `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 6]: and spoke a name simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 16]: It was as if they had said , `` Oh , the bubonic plague ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 4]: Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 32]: `` Georgie does not play with him , '' said Mrs. Bassett quickly -- `` that is , he avoids him as much as he can without hurting Penrod 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 8]: Georgie is very sensitive to giving pain .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 74]: I suppose a mother should not tell these things , and I know people who talk about their own children are dreadful bores , but it was only last Thursday night that Georgie looked up in my face so sweetly , after he had said his prayers and his little cheeks flushed , as he said : ` Mamma , I think it would be right for me to go more with Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 12]: I think it would make him a better boy . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 7]: A sibilance went about the room .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 3]: `` Sweet !
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 3]: How sweet !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 5]: The sweet little soul !
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 5]: Ah , SWEET ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 21]: `` And that very afternoon , '' continued Mrs. Bassett , `` he had come home in a dreadful state .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 9]: Penrod had thrown tar all over him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 9]: `` Your son has a forgiving spirit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 6]: said Mr. Kinosling with vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 9]: `` A too forgiving spirit , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 6]: He set down his glass .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 8]: `` No more , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 8]: No more cake , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 29]: Was it not Cardinal Newman who said -- '' He was interrupted by the sounds of an altercation just outside the closed blinds of the window nearest him .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 8]: `` Let him pick his tree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 8]: It was the voice of Samuel Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 16]: `` Did n't we come over here to give him one of his own trees ?
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 11]: Give him a fair show , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 6]: `` The little lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 4]: Mr. Kinosling smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 13]: `` They have their games , their outdoor sports , their pastimes .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 6]: The young muscles are toughening .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 7]: The sun will not harm them .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: They grow ; they expand ; they learn .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: They learn fair play , honour , courtesy , from one another , as pebbles grow round in the brook .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 9]: They learn more from themselves than from us .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 8]: They take shape , form , outline .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 4]: Let them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 5]: `` Mr. Kinosling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 22]: Another spinster -- undeterred by what had happened to Miss Beam -- leaned fair forward , her face shining and ardent .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 16]: `` Mr. Kinosling , there 's a question I DO wish to ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 28]: `` My dear Miss Cosslit , '' Mr. Kinosling responded , again waving his hand and watching it , `` I am entirely at your disposal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 17]: `` WAS Joan of Arc , '' she asked fervently , `` inspired by spirits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 4]: He smiled indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 10]: `` Yes -- and no , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 7]: `` One must give both answers .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 17]: One must give the answer , yes ; one must give the answer , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 7]: `` Oh , THANK you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 6]: said Miss Cosslit , blushing .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 13]: `` She 's one of my great enthusiasms , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 23]: `` And I have a question , too , '' urged Mrs. Lora Rewbush , after a moment 's hasty concentration . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 20]: ` I 've never been able to settle it for myself , but NOW -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 5]: said Mr. Kinosling encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 24]: `` Is -- ah -- is -- oh , yes : Is Sanskrit a more difficult language than Spanish , Mr. Kinosling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 13]: `` It depends upon the student , '' replied the oracle smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 9]: `` One must not look for linguists everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 33]: In my own especial case -- if one may cite one 's self as an example -- I found no great , no insurmountable difficulty in mastering , in conquering either . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 10]: `` And may _ I _ ask one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 4]: ventured Mrs. Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 12]: `` Do you think it is right to wear egrets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 31]: `` There are marks of quality , of caste , of social distinction , '' Mr. Kinosling began , `` which must be permitted , allowed , though perhaps regulated .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 14]: Social distinction , one observes , almost invariably implies spiritual distinction as well .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 9]: Distinction of circumstances is accompanied by mental distinction .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 51]: Distinction is hereditary ; it descends from father to son , and if there is one thing more true than ` Like father , like son , ' it is -- '' he bowed gallantly to Mrs. Bassett -- `` it is , ` Like mother , like son . '
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 18]: What these good ladies have said this afternoon of YOUR -- '' This was the fatal instant .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 23]: There smote upon all ears the voice of Georgie , painfully shrill and penetrating -- fraught with protest and protracted , strain .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 33]: His plain words consisted of the newly sanctioned and disinfected curse with a big H. With an ejaculation of horror , Mrs. Bassett sprang to the window and threw open the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 12]: Georgie 's back was disclosed to the view of the tea-party .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 15]: He was endeavouring to ascend a maple tree about twelve feet from the window .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 42]: Embracing the trunk with arms and legs , he had managed to squirm to a point above the heads of Penrod and Herman , who stood close by , watching him earnestly -- Penrod being obviously in charge of the performance .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 34]: Across the yard were Sam Williams and Maurice Levy , acting as a jury on the question of voice-power , and it was to a complaint of theirs that Georgie had just replied .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 12]: `` That 's right , Georgie , '' said Penrod encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 9]: `` They can , too , hear you .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 5]: Let her go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 6]: `` Going to heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 8]: shrieked Georgie , squirming up another inch .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 10]: `` Going to heaven , heaven , heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 12]: His mother 's frenzied attempts to attract his attention failed utterly .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 19]: Georgie was using the full power of his lungs , deafening his own ears to all other sounds .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 18]: Mrs. Bassett called in vain ; while the tea-party stood petrified in a cluster about the window .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: `` Going to heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 3]: Georgie bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 5]: `` Going to heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 7]: Going to heaven , my Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 9]: Going to heaven , heaven , heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 20]: He tried to climb higher , but began to slip downward , his exertions causing damage to his apparel .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 16]: A button flew into the air , and his knickerbockers and his waistband severed relations .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 9]: `` Devil 's got my coat-tails , sinners !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 8]: Old devil 's got my coat-tails ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 4]: he announced appropriately .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 6]: Then he began to slide .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 13]: He relaxed his clasp of the tree and slid to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 6]: `` Going to hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 14]: shrieked Georgie , reaching a high pitch of enthusiasm in this great climax .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 5]: `` Going to hell !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 4]: Going to hell !
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 11]: I 'm gone to hell , hell , hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 25]: With a loud scream , Mrs. Bassett threw herself out of the window , alighting by some miracle upon her feet with ankles unsprained .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 25]: Mr. Kinosling , feeling that his presence as spiritual adviser was demanded in the yard , followed with greater dignity through the front door .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 15]: At the corner of the house a small departing figure collided with him violently .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 18]: It was Penrod , tactfully withdrawing from what promised to be a family scene of unusual painfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 18]: Mr. Kinosling seized him by the shoulders and , giving way to emotion , shook him viciously .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: `` You horrible boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr. Kinosling .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 5]: `` You ruffianly creature !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 15]: Do you know what 's going to happen to you when you grow up ?
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 11]: Do you realize what you 're going to BE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 13]: With flashing eyes , the indignant boy made know his unshaken purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 10]: He shouted the reply : `` A minister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 108]: CHAPTER XXVIII TWELVE This busy globe which spawns us is as incapable of flattery and as intent upon its own affair , whatever that is , as a gyroscope ; it keeps steadily whirling along its lawful track , and , thus far seeming to hold a right of way , spins doggedly on , with no perceptible diminution of speed to mark the most gigantic human events -- it did not pause to pant and recuperate even when what seemed to Penrod its principal purpose was accomplished , and an enormous shadow , vanishing westward over its surface , marked the dawn of his twelfth birthday .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 10]: To be twelve is an attainment worth the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 16]: A boy , just twelve , is like a Frenchman just elected to the Academy .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 7]: Distinction and honour wait upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 29]: Younger boys show deference to a person of twelve : his experience is guaranteed , his judgment , therefore , mellow ; consequently , his influence is profound .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 12]: Eleven is not quite satisfactory : it is only an approach .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 17]: Eleven has the disadvantage of six , of nineteen , of forty-four , and of sixty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 20]: But , like twelve , seven is an honourable age , and the ambition to attain it is laudable .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 7]: People look forward to being seven .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 31]: Similarly , twenty is worthy , and so , arbitrarily , is twenty-one ; forty-five has great solidity ; seventy is most commendable and each year thereafter an increasing honour .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 17]: Thirteen is embarrassed by the beginnings of a new colthood ; the child becomes a youth .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 9]: But twelve is the very top of boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 18]: Dressing , that morning , Penrod felt that the world was changed from the world of yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 18]: For one thing , he seemed to own more of it ; this day was HIS day .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 67]: And it was a day worth owning ; the midsummer sunshine , pouring gold through his window , came from a cool sky , and a breeze moved pleasantly in his hair as he leaned from the sill to watch the tribe of clattering blackbirds take wing , following their leader from the trees in the yard to the day 's work in the open country .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 31]: The blackbirds were his , as the sunshine and the breeze were his , for they all belonged to the day which was his birthday and therefore most surely his .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 8]: Pride suffused him : he was twelve !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 17]: His father and his mother and Margaret seemed to understand the difference between to-day and yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 22]: They were at the table when he descended , and they gave him a greeting which of itself marked the milestone .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 45]: Habitually , his entrance into a room where his elders sat brought a cloud of apprehension : they were prone to look up in pathetic expectancy , as if their thought was , `` What new awfulness is he going to start NOW ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 29]: But this morning they laughed ; his mother rose and kissed him twelve times , so did Margaret ; and his father shouted , `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: How 's the MAN ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 40]: Then his mother gave him a Bible and `` The Vicar of Wakefield '' ; Margaret gave him a pair of silver-mounted hair brushes ; and his father gave him a `` Pocket Atlas '' and a small compass .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 36]: `` And now , Penrod , '' said his mother , after breakfast , `` I 'm going to take you out in the country to pay your birthday respects to Aunt Sarah Crim . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 14]: Aunt Sarah Crim , Penrod 's great-aunt , was his oldest living relative .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 28]: She was ninety , and when Mrs. Schofield and Penrod alighted from a carriage at her gate they found her digging with a spade in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 16]: `` I 'm glad you brought him , '' she said , desisting from labour .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 16]: `` Jinny 's baking a cake I 'm going to send for his birthday party .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 6]: Bring him in the house .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 8]: I 've got something for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 57]: She led the way to her `` sitting-room , '' which had a pleasant smell , unlike any other smell , and , opening the drawer of a shining old what-not , took therefrom a boy 's `` sling-shot , '' made of a forked stick , two strips of rubber and a bit of leather .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 19]: `` This is n't for you , '' she said , placing it in Penrod 's eager hand .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 22]: It would break all to pieces the first time you tried to shoot it , because it is thirty-five years old .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 10]: I want to send it back to your father .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 6]: I think it 's time .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 23]: You give it to him from me , and tell him I say I believe I can trust him with it now .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 38]: I took it away from him thirty-five years ago , one day after he 'd killed my best hen with it , accidentally , and broken a glass pitcher on the back porch with it -- accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 47]: He does n't look like a person who 's ever done things of that sort , and I suppose he 's forgotten it so well that he believes he never DID , but if you give it to him from me I think he 'll remember .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 7]: You look like him , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 9]: He was anything but a handsome boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 52]: After this final bit of reminiscence -- probably designed to be repeated to Mr. Schofield -- she disappeared in the direction of the kitchen , and returned with a pitcher of lemonade and a blue china dish sweetly freighted with flat ginger cookies of a composition that was her own secret .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 29]: Then , having set this collation before her guests , she presented Penrod with a superb , intricate , and very modern machine of destructive capacities almost limitless .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: She called it a pocket-knife .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 17]: `` I suppose you 'll do something horrible with it , '' she said , composedly .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 29]: `` I hear you do that with everything , anyhow , so you might as well do it with this , and have more fun out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 12]: They tell me you 're the Worst Boy in Town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 7]: `` Oh , Aunt Sarah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 7]: Mrs. Schofield lifted a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 4]: said Mrs. Crim .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 7]: `` But on his birthday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 9]: `` That 's the time to say it .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 12]: Penrod , are n't you the Worst Boy in Town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 27]: Penrod , gazing fondly upon his knife and eating cookies rapidly , answered as a matter of course , and absently , `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 4]: `` Certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 4]: said Mrs. Crim .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 18]: `` Once you accept a thing about yourself as established and settled , it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 3]: Nobody minds .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 8]: Boys are just people , really . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 6]: Mrs. Schofield cried , involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 11]: `` Yes , they are , '' returned Aunt Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 23]: `` Only they 're not quite so awful , because they have n't learned to cover themselves all over with little pretences .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 52]: When Penrod grows up he 'll be just the same as he is now , except that whenever he does what he wants to do he 'll tell himself and other people a little story about it to make his reason for doing it seem nice and pretty and noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 8]: `` No , I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 4]: said Penrod suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 12]: `` There 's one cookie left , '' observed Aunt Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 9]: `` Are you going to eat it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said her great-nephew , thoughtfully , `` I guess I better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 5]: asked the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 12]: `` Why do you guess you 'd ` better ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 32]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , with a full mouth , `` it might get all dried up if nobody took it , and get thrown out and wasted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 11]: `` You 're beginning finely , '' Mrs. Crim remarked .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 18]: `` A year ago you 'd have taken the cookie without the same sense of thrift . ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 13]: I see that you 're twelve years old , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 8]: There are more cookies , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 37]: She went away , returning with a fresh supply and the observation , `` Of course , you 'll be sick before the day 's over ; you might as well get a good start . ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 5]: Mrs. Schofield looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 22]: `` Aunt Sarah , '' she ventured , `` do n't you really think we improve as we get older ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 25]: `` Meaning , '' said the old lady , `` that Penrod has n't much chance to escape the penitentiary if he does n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 34]: Well , we do learn to restrain ourselves in some things ; and there are people who really want someone else to take the last cookie , though they are n't very common .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 15]: But it 's all right , the world seems to be getting on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 35]: She gazed whimsically upon her great-nephew and added , `` Of course , when you watch a boy and think about him , it does n't seem to be getting on very fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 36]: Penrod moved uneasily in his chair ; he was conscious that he was her topic but unable to make out whether or not her observations were complimentary ; he inclined to think they were not .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 8]: Mrs. Crim settled the question for him .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 12]: `` I suppose Penrod is regarded as the neighbourhood curse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , '' cried Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 20]: `` He -- '' `` I dare say the neighbours are right , '' continued the old lady placidly .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 23]: `` He 's had to repeat the history of the race and go through all the stages from the primordial to barbarism .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 13]: You do n't expect boys to be civilized , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 16]: `` Well , I -- '' `` You might as well expect eggs to crow .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 22]: No ; you 've got to take boys as they are , and learn to know them as they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 17]: `` Naturally , Aunt Sarah , '' said Mrs. Schofield , `` I KNOW Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 5]: Aunt Sarah laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 12]: `` Do you think his father knows him , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 15]: `` Of course , men are different , '' Mrs. Schofield returned , apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 25]: `` But a mother knows -- '' `` Penrod , '' said Aunt Sarah , solemnly , `` does your father understand you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: `` About as much as he 'd understand Sitting Bull ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 15]: `` And I 'll tell you what your mother thinks you are , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 14]: Her real belief is that you 're a novice in a convent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 5]: `` Aunt Sarah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 22]: `` I know she thinks that , because whenever you do n't behave like a novice she 's disappointed in you .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 39]: And your father really believes that you 're a decorous , well-trained young business man , and whenever you do n't live up to that standard you get on his nerves and he thinks you need a walloping .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 24]: I 'm sure a day very seldom passes without their both saying they do n't know what on earth to do with you .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 10]: Does whipping do you any good , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 14]: `` Go on and finish the lemonade ; there 's about glassful left .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 14]: Oh , take it , take it ; and do n't say why !
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 9]: Of COURSE you 're a little pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 17]: Penrod laughed gratefully , his eyes fixed upon her over the rim of his uptilted glass .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 12]: `` Fill yourself up uncomfortably , '' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 21]: `` You 're twelve years old , and you ought to be happy -- if you are n't anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 29]: It 's taken over nineteen hundred years of Christianity and some hundreds of thousands of years of other things to produce you , and there you sit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 28]: `` It 'll be your turn to struggle and muss things up , for the betterment of posterity , soon enough , '' said Aunt Sarah Crim .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 6]: `` Drink your lemonade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 24]: CHAPTER XXIX FANCHON `` Aunt Sarah 's a funny old lady , '' Penrod observed , on the way back to the town .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 14]: `` What 's she want me to give papa this old sling for ?
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 17]: Last thing she said was to be sure not to forget to give it to him .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 18]: HE do n't want it ; and she said , herself , it ai n't any good .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 13]: She 's older than you or papa , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 19]: `` About fifty years older , '' answered Mrs. Schofield , turning upon him a stare of perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 26]: `` Do n't cut into the leather with your new knife , dear ; the livery man might ask us to pay if -- No .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 17]: I would n't scrape the paint off , either -- nor whittle your shoe with it .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 12]: COULD N'T you put it up until we get home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 8]: `` We goin ' straight home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 25]: We 're going to stop at Mrs. Gelbraith 's and ask a strange little girl to come to your party , this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 6]: `` Her name is Fanchon .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 9]: She 's Mrs. Gelbraith 's little niece . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 8]: `` What makes her so queer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 10]: `` I did n't say she 's queer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 16]: `` You said -- '' `` No ; I mean that she is a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 13]: She lives in New York and has come to visit here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 11]: `` What 's she live in New York for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 7]: `` Because her parents live there .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 18]: You must be very nice to her , Penrod ; she has been very carefully brought up .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 25]: Besides , she does n't know the children here , and you must help to keep her from feeling lonely at your party . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 25]: When they reached Mrs. Gelbraith 's , Penrod sat patiently humped upon a gilt chair during the lengthy exchange of greetings between his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 4]: and Mrs. Gelbraith .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 70]: That is one of the things a boy must learn to bear : when his mother meets a compeer there is always a long and dreary wait for him , while the two appear to be using strange symbols of speech , talking for the greater part , it seems to him , simultaneously , and employing a wholly incomprehensible system of emphasis at other times not in vogue .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 11]: Penrod twisted his legs , his cap and his nose .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 6]: `` Here she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 23]: Mrs. Gelbraith cried , unexpectedly , and a dark-haired , demure person entered the room wearing a look of gracious social expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 19]: In years she was eleven , in manner about sixty-five , and evidently had lived much at court .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 51]: She performed a curtsey in acknowledgment of Mrs. Schofield 's greeting , and bestowed her hand upon Penrod , who had entertained no hope of such an honour , showed his surprise that it should come to him , and was plainly unable to decide what to do about it .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 25]: `` Fanchon , dear , '' said Mrs. Gelbraith , `` take Penrod out in the yard for a while , and play . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 24]: `` Let go the little girl 's hand , Penrod , '' Mrs. Schofield laughed , as the children turned toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 26]: Penrod hastily dropped the small hand , and exclaiming , with simple honesty , `` Why , _ I _ do n't want it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 19]: followed Fanchon out into the sunshiny yard , where they came to a halt and surveyed each other .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 44]: Penrod stared awkwardly at Fanchon , no other occupation suggesting itself to him , while Fanchon , with the utmost coolness , made a very thorough visual examination of Penrod , favouring him with an estimating scrutiny which lasted until he literally wiggled .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 5]: Finally , she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 9]: `` Where do you buy your ties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 8]: `` Where do you buy your neckties ?
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 7]: Papa gets his at Skoone 's .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: You ought to get yours there .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 15]: I 'm sure the one you 're wearing is n't from Skoone 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 5]: `` Skoone 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 3]: Penrod repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 5]: `` Skoone 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 9]: `` On Fifth Avenue , '' said Fanchon .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 13]: `` It 's a very smart shop , the men say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 4]: `` Men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 8]: echoed Penrod , in a hazy whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 4]: `` Men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 10]: `` Where do your people go in summer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 4]: inquired the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 22]: `` WE go to Long Shore , but so many middle-class people have begun coming there , mamma thinks of leaving .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 13]: The middle classes are simply awful , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 6]: `` They 're so boorjaw .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 8]: You speak French , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 9]: `` We ran over to Paris last year .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 9]: It 's lovely , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 11]: Do n't you LOVE the Rue de la Paix ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 6]: Penrod wandered in a labyrinth .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 33]: This girl seemed to be talking , but her words were dumfounding , and of course there was no way for him to know that he was really listening to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 37]: It was his first meeting with one of those grown-up little girls , wonderful product of the winter apartment and summer hotel ; and Fanchon , an only child , was a star of the brand .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 6]: He began to feel resentful .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 18]: `` I suppose , '' she went on , `` I 'll find everything here fearfully Western .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 8]: Some nice people called yesterday , though .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 7]: Do you know the Magsworth Bittses ?
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 6]: Auntie says they 're charming .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 8]: Will Roddy be at your party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 14]: `` I guess he will , '' returned Penrod , finding this intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 5]: `` The mutt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 4]: Fanchon exclaimed airily .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 10]: `` Are n't you great pals with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 8]: `` What 's ` pals ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 19]: Do n't you know what it means to say you 're ` great pals ' with any one ?
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 7]: You ARE an odd child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 5]: It was too much .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 6]: `` Oh , Bugs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 9]: This bit of ruffianism had a curious effect .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: Fanchon looked upon him with sudden favour .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 8]: `` I like you , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 26]: she said , in an odd way , and , whatever else there may have been in her manner , there certainly was no shyness .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 6]: `` Oh , Bugs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 17]: This repetition may have lacked gallantry , but it was uttered in no very decided tone .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 4]: Penrod was shaken .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 8]: She stepped closer to him , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 9]: `` Your hair is ever so pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 56]: Sailors ' parrots swear like mariners , they say ; and gay mothers ought to realize that all children are imitative , for , as the precocious Fanchon leaned toward Penrod , the manner in which she looked into his eyes might have made a thoughtful observer wonder where she had learned her pretty ways .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 32]: Penrod was even more confused than he had been by her previous mysteries : but his confusion was of a distinctly pleasant and alluring nature : he wanted more of it .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 26]: Looking intentionally into another person 's eyes is an act unknown to childhood ; and Penrod 's discovery that it could be done was sensational .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 13]: He had never thought of looking into the eyes of Marjorie Jones .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 40]: Despite all anguish , contumely , tar , and Maurice Levy , he still secretly thought of Marjorie , with pathetic constancy , as his `` beau '' -- though that is not how he would have spelled it .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 33]: Marjorie was beautiful ; her curls were long and the colour of amber ; her nose was straight and her freckles were honest ; she was much prettier than this accomplished visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 6]: But beauty is not all .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 5]: breathed Fanchon , softly .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 14]: She seemed to him a fairy creature from some rosier world than this .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 27]: So humble is the human heart , it glorifies and makes glamorous almost any poor thing that says to it : `` I like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 4]: Penrod was enslaved .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 29]: He swallowed , coughed , scratched the back of his neck , and said , disjointedly : `` Well -- I do n't care if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 6]: I just as soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 16]: `` We 'll dance together , '' said Fanchon , `` at your party . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 5]: `` I guess so .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 6]: I just as soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 10]: `` Do n't you want to , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'm willing to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 6]: Say you WANT to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 32]: `` Well -- '' He used his toe as a gimlet , boring into the ground , his wide open eyes staring with intense vacancy at a button on his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 24]: His mother appeared upon the porch in departure , calling farewells over her shoulder to Mrs. Gelbraith , who stood in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 5]: `` Say it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 3]: whispered Fanchon .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 9]: `` Well , I just as SOON . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 4]: She seemed satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 52]: CHAPTER XXX THE BIRTHDAY PARTY A dancing floor had been laid upon a platform in the yard , when Mrs. Schofield and her son arrived at their own abode ; and a white and scarlet striped canopy was in process of erection overhead , to shelter the dancers from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 21]: Workmen were busy everywhere under the direction of Margaret , and the smitten heart of Penrod began to beat rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 10]: All this was for him ; he was Twelve !
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 12]: After lunch , he underwent an elaborate toilette and murmured not .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 25]: For the first time in his life he knew the wish to be sand-papered , waxed , and polished to the highest possible degree .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 37]: And when the operation was over , he stood before the mirror in new bloom , feeling encouraged to hope that his resemblance to his father was not so strong as Aunt Sarah seemed to think .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 36]: The white gloves upon his hands had a pleasant smell , he found ; and , as he came down the stairs , he had great content in the twinkling of his new dancing slippers .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 27]: He stepped twice on each step , the better to enjoy their effect and at the same time he deeply inhaled the odour of the gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 11]: In spite of everything , Penrod had his social capacities .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 18]: Already it is to be perceived that there were in him the makings of a cotillon leader .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 35]: Then came from the yard a sound of tuning instruments , squeak of fiddle , croon of ` cello , a falling triangle ringing and tinkling to the floor ; and he turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 30]: Chosen guests began to arrive , while Penrod , suffering from stage-fright and perspiration , stood beside his mother , in the `` drawing-room , '' to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 42]: He greeted unfamiliar acquaintances and intimate fellow-criminals with the same frigidity , murmuring : '' 'M glad to see y ' , '' to all alike , largely increasing the embarrassment which always prevails at the beginning of children 's festivities .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 27]: His unnatural pomp and circumstance had so thoroughly upset him , in truth , that Marjorie Jones received a distinct shock , now to be related .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 45]: Doctor Thrope , the kind old clergyman who had baptized Penrod , came in for a moment to congratulate the boy , and had just moved away when it was Marjorie 's turn , in the line of children , to speak to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 25]: She gave him what she considered a forgiving look , and , because of the occasion , addressed him in a perfectly courteous manner .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 14]: `` I wish you many happy returns of the day , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 7]: `` Thank you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 20]: he returned , following Dr. Thrope with a glassy stare in which there was absolutely no recognition of Marjorie .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 21]: Then he greeted Maurice Levy , who was next to Marjorie : '' 'M glad to see y ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 15]: Dumfounded , Marjorie turned aside , and stood near , observing Penrod with gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 10]: It was the first great surprise of her life .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 39]: Customarily , she had seemed to place his character somewhere between that of the professional rioter and that of the orang-outang ; nevertheless , her manner at times just hinted a consciousness that this Caliban was her property .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 24]: Wherefore , she stared at him incredulously as his head bobbed up and down , in the dancing-school bow , greeting his guests .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 19]: Then she heard an adult voice , near her , exclaim : `` What an exquisite child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 25]: Mariorie galanced up -- a little consciously , though she was used to it -- naturally curious to ascertain who was speaking of her .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 22]: It was Sam Williams ' mother addressing Mrs. Bassett , both being present to help Mrs. Schofield make the festivities festive .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 4]: `` Exquisite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 16]: Here was a second heavy surprise for Marjorie : they were not looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 27]: They were looking with beaming approval at a girl she had never seen ; a dark and modish stranger of singularly composed and yet modest aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 33]: Her downcast eyes , becoming in one thus entering a crowded room , were all that produced the effect of modesty , counteracting something about her which might have seemed too assured .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 29]: She was very slender , very dainty , and her apparel was disheartening to the other girls ; it was of a knowing picturesqueness wholly unfamiliar to them .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 38]: There was a delicate trace of powder upon the lobe of Fanchon 's left ear , and the outlines of her eyelids , if very closely scrutinized , would have revealed successful experimentation with a burnt match .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 16]: Marjorie 's lovely eyes dilated : she learned the meaning of hatred at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 18]: Observing the stranger with instinctive suspicion , all at once she seemed , to herself , awkward .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 35]: Poor Marjorie underwent that experience which hearty , healthy , little girls and big girls undergo at one time or another -- from heels to head she felt herself , somehow , too THICK .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 18]: Fanchon leaned close to Penrod and whispered in his ear : `` Do n't you forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 3]: Penrod blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 5]: Marjorie saw the blush .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 17]: Her lovely eyes opened even wider , and in them there began to grow a light .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 23]: It was the light of indignation ; -- at least , people whose eyes glow with that light always call it indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 19]: Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , approached Fanchon , when she had made her courtesy to Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 8]: Fanchon whispered in Roderick 's ear also .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 8]: `` Your hair is pretty , Roddy !
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 9]: Do n't forget what you said yesterday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 4]: Roderick likewise blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 15]: Maurice Levy , captivated by the newcomer 's appearance , pressed close to Roderick .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 9]: `` Give us an intaduction , Roddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 63]: Roddy being either reluctant or unable to perform the rite , Fanchon took matters into her own hands , and was presently favourably impressed with Maurice , receiving the information that his tie had been brought to him by his papa from Skoone 's , whereupon she privately informed him that she liked wavy hair , and arranged to dance with him .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 58]: Fanchon also thought sandy hair attractive , Sam Williams discovered , a few minutes later , and so catholic was her taste that a ring of boys quite encircled her before the musicians in the yard struck up their thrilling march , and Mrs. Schofield brought Penrod to escort the lady from out-of-town to the dancing pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 25]: Headed by this pair , the children sought partners and paraded solemnly out of the front door and round a corner of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 33]: There they found the gay marquee ; the small orchestra seated on the lawn at one side of it , and a punch bowl of lemonade inviting attention , under a tree .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 18]: Decorously the small couples stepped upon the platform , one after another , and began to dance .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 23]: `` It 's not much like a children 's party in our day , '' Mrs. Williams said to Penrod 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 27]: `` We 'd have been playing ` Quaker-meeting , ' ` Clap-in , Clap-out , ' or ` Going to Jerusalem , ' I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 17]: `` Yes , or ` Post-office ' and ` Drop-the-handkerchief , ' '' said Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 6]: `` Things change so quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 12]: Imagine asking little Fanchon Gelbraith to play ` London Bridge ' !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 26]: Penrod seems to be having a difficult time with her , poor boy ; he was n't a shining light in the dancing class . ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 15]: However , Penrod 's difficulty was not precisely of the kind his mother supposed .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 23]: Fanchon was showing him a new step , which she taught her next partner in turn , continuing instructions during the dancing .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 38]: The children crowded the floor , and in the kaleidoscopic jumble of bobbing heads and intermingling figures her extremely different style of motion was unobserved by the older people , who looked on , nodding time benevolently .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 8]: Fanchon fascinated girls as well as boys .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 71]: Many of the former eagerly sought her acquaintance and thronged about her between the dances , when , accepting the deference due a cosmopolitan and an oracle of the mode , she gave demonstrations of the new step to succeeding groups , professing astonishment to find it unknown : it had been `` all the go , '' she explained , at the Long Shore Casino for fully two seasons .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 52]: She pronounced `` slow '' a `` Fancy Dance '' executed during an intermission by Baby Rennsdale and Georgie Bassett , giving it as her opinion that Miss Rennsdale and Mr. Bassett were `` dead ones '' ; and she expressed surprise that the punch bowl contained lemonade and not champagne .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 19]: The dancing continued , the new step gaining instantly in popularity , fresh couples adventuring with every number .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 23]: The word `` step '' is somewhat misleading , nothing done with the feet being vital to the evolutions introduced by Fanchon .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 113]: Fanchon 's dance came from the Orient by a roundabout way ; pausing in Spain , taking on a Gallic frankness in gallantry at the Bal Bullier in Paris , combining with a relative from the South Seas encountered in San Francisco , flavouring itself with a carefree negroid abandon in New Orleans , and , accumulating , too , something inexpressible from Mexico and South America , it kept , throughout its travels , to the underworld , or to circles where nature is extremely frank and rank , until at last it reached the dives of New York , when it immediately broke out in what is called civilized society .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 60]: Thereafter it spread , in variously modified forms -- some of them disinfected -- to watering-places , and thence , carried by hundreds of older male and female Fanchons , over the country , being eagerly adopted everywhere and made wholly pure and respectable by the supreme moral axiom that anything is all right if enough people do it .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 5]: Everybody was doing it .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 4]: Not quite everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 23]: It was perhaps some test of this dance that earth could furnish no more grotesque sight than that of children doing it .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 15]: Earth , assisted by Fanchon , was furnishing this sight at Penrod 's party .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 58]: By the time ice-cream and cake arrived , about half the guests had either been initiated into the mysteries by Fanchon or were learning by imitation , and the education of the other half was resumed with the dancing , when the attendant ladies , unconscious of what was happening , withdrew into the house for tea .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 14]: `` That orchestra 's a dead one , '' Fanchon remarked to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 11]: `` We ought to liven them up a little ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 5]: She approached the musicians .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 19]: `` Do n't you know , '' she asked the leader , `` the Slingo Sligo Slide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 46]: The leader giggled , nodded , rapped with his bow upon his violin ; and Penrod , following Fanchon back upon the dancing floor , blindly brushed with his elbow a solitary little figure standing aloof on the lawn at the edge of the platform .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 4]: It was Marjorie .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 51]: In no mood to approve of anything introduced by Fanchon , she had scornfully refused , from the first , to dance the new `` step , '' and , because of its bonfire popularity , found herself neglected in a society where she had reigned as beauty and belle .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 25]: Faithless Penrod , dazed by the sweeping Fanchon , had utterly forgotten the amber curls ; he had not once asked Marjorie to dance .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 31]: All afternoon the light of indignation had been growing brighter in her eyes , though Maurice Levy 's defection to the lady from New York had not fanned this flame .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 29]: From the moment Fanchon had whispered familiarly in Penrod 's ear , and Penrod had blushed , Marjorie had been occupied exclusively with resentment against that guilty pair .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 47]: It seemed to her that Penrod had no right to allow a strange girl to whisper in his ear ; that his blushing , when the strange girl did it , was atrocious ; and that the strange girl , herself , ought to be arrested .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 40]: Forgotten by the merrymakers , Marjorie stood alone upon the lawn , clenching her small fists , watching the new dance at its high tide , and hating it with a hatred that made every inch of her tremble .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 33]: And , perhaps because jealousy is a great awakener of the virtues , she had a perception of something in it worse than lack of dignity -- something vaguely but outrageously reprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 34]: Finally , when Penrod brushed by her , touched her with his elbow , and , did not even see her , Marjorie 's state of mind -LRB- not unmingled with emotion ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 3]: became dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 29]: In fact , a trained nurse , chancing to observe her at this juncture , would probably have advised that she be taken home and put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: Marjorie was on the verge of hysterics .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 46]: She saw Fanchon and Penrod assume the double embrace required by the dance ; the `` Slingo Sligo Slide '' burst from the orchestra like the lunatic shriek of a gin-maddened nigger ; and all the little couples began to bob and dip and sway .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 5]: Marjorie made a scene .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 10]: She sprang upon the platform and stamped her foot .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 3]: she shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 6]: `` You BEHAVE yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 9]: The remarkable girl took Penrod by the ear .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 16]: By his ear she swung him away from Fanchon and faced him toward the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 9]: `` You march straight out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 3]: she commanded .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 3]: Penrod marched .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 22]: He was stunned ; obeyed automatically , without question , and had very little realization of what was happening to him .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 21]: Altogether , and without reason , he was in precisely the condition of an elderly spouse detected in flagrant misbehaviour .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 17]: Marjorie , similarly , was in precisely the condition of the party who detects such misbehaviour .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 33]: It may be added that she had acted with a promptness , a decision and a disregard of social consequences all to be commended to the attention of ladies in like predicament .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 10]: `` You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 9]: she raged , when they reached the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 9]: `` Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 5]: he inquired , helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 6]: `` You be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 11]: `` But what 'd _ I _ do , Marjorie ?
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 14]: _ I _ have n't done anything to you , '' he pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 18]: `` I have n't even seen you , all aftern -- '' `` You be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 8]: she cried , tears filling her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 4]: `` Keep still !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 4]: You ugly boy !
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 4]: Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 4]: She slapped him .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: He should have understood from this how much she cared for him .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 19]: But he rubbed his cheek and declared ruefully : `` I 'll never speak to you again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 7]: `` You will , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 5]: she sobbed , passionately .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 6]: `` I will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 9]: He turned to leave her , but paused .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 22]: His mother , his sister Margaret , and their grownup friends had finished their tea and were approaching from the house .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 24]: Other parents and guardians were with them , coming for their children ; and there were carriages and automobiles waiting in the street .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 11]: But the `` Slingo Slide '' went on , regardless .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 17]: The group of grown-up people hesitated and came to a halt , gazing at the pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 7]: `` What are they doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 7]: gasped Mrs. Williams , blushing deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 5]: What IS it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 6]: `` WHAT IS IT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 8]: Mrs. Gelbraith echoed in a frightened whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 10]: `` WHAT -- '' `` They 're Tangoing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 4]: cried Margaret Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 23]: `` Or Bunny Hugging or Grizzly Bearing , or -- '' `` They 're only Turkey Trotting , '' said Robert Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 15]: With fearful outcries the mothers , aunts , and sisters rushed upon the pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 39]: `` Of course it was dreadful , '' said Mrs. Schofield , an hour later , rendering her lord an account of the day , `` but it was every bit the fault of that one extraordinary child .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 21]: And of all the quiet , demur little things -- that is , I mean , when she first came .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 16]: We all spoke of how exquisite she seemed -- so well trained , so finished !
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 4]: Eleven years old !
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 11]: I never saw anything like her in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 14]: `` I suppose it 's the New Child , '' her husband grunted .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 18]: `` And to think of her saying there ought to have been champagne in the lemonade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 16]: `` Probably she 'd forgotten to bring her pocket flask , '' he suggested musingly .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 10]: `` But are n't you proud of Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 5]: cried Penrod 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 27]: `` It was just as I told you : he was standing clear outside the pavilion -- '' `` I never thought to see the day !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 16]: And Penrod was the only boy not doing it , the only one to refuse ?
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 11]: ALL the others were -- '' `` Every one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 4]: she returned triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 6]: `` Even Georgie Bassett ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 14]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Schofield , patting her on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 13]: `` I guess we can hold up our heads at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 18]: CHAPTER XXXI OVER THE FENCE Penrod was out in the yard , staring at the empty marquee .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 36]: The sun was on the horizon line , so far behind the back fence , and a western window of the house blazed in gold unbearable to the eye : his day was nearly over .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 26]: He sighed , and took from the inside pocket of his new jacket the `` sling-shot '' aunt Sarah Crim had given him that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 6]: He snapped the rubbers absently .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 12]: They held fast ; and his next impulse was entirely irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 22]: He found a shapely stone , fitted it to the leather , and drew back the ancient catapult for a shot .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 36]: A sparrow hopped upon a branch between him and the house , and he aimed at the sparrow , but the reflection from the dazzling window struck in his eyes as he loosed the leather .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 10]: He missed the sparrow , but not the window .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 34]: There was a loud crash , and to his horror he caught a glimpse of his father , stricken in mid-shaving , ducking a shower of broken glass , glittering razor flourishing wildly .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 13]: Words crashed with the glass , stentorian words , fragmentary but collossal .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: Penrod stood petrified , a broken sling in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 40]: He could hear his parent 's booming descent of the back stairs , instant and furious ; and then , red-hot above white lather , Mr. Schofield burst out of the kitchen door and hurtled forth upon his son .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 9]: he demanded , shaking Penrod by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 47]: `` Ten minutes ago , for the very first time in our lives , your mother and I were saying we were proud of you , and here you go and throw a rock at me through the window when I 'm shaving for dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: `` I did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 3]: Penrod quavered .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 27]: `` I was shooting at a sparrow , and the sun got in his eyes , and the sling broke -- '' `` What sling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 14]: `` This ` n. '' `` Where 'd you get that devilish thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 23]: Do n't you know I 've forbidden you a thousand times -- '' `` It ai n't mine , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 6]: `` It 's yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , '' said the boy meekly .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 20]: `` Aunt Sarah Crim gave it to me this morning and told me to give it back to you .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 12]: She said she took it away from you thirty-five years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 8]: You killed her hen , she said .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 15]: She told me some more to tell you , but I 've forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 4]: said Mr. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 29]: He took the broken sling in his hand , looked at it long and thoughtfully -- and he looked longer , and quite as thoughtfully , at Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 11]: Then he turned away , and walked toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: `` I 'm sorry , papa , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 21]: Mr. Schofield coughed , and , as he reached the door , called back , but without turning his head .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 7]: `` Never mind , little boy .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 9]: A broken window is n't much harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 26]: When he had gone in , Penrod wandered down the yard to the back fence , climbed upon it , and sat in reverie there .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 15]: A slight figure appeared , likewise upon a fence , beyond two neighbouring yards .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 5]: called comrade Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 4]: `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 5]: returned Penrod , mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 8]: `` I caught Billy Blue Hill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 14]: shouted Sam , describing retribution in a manner perfectly clear to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 12]: `` You were mighty lucky to get out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 6]: `` I know that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 15]: `` You would n't of , if it had n't been for Marjorie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 10]: `` Well , do n't I know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 6]: Penrod shouted , with heat .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 7]: `` Well , so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 29]: called Sam , dropping from his fence ; and the friendly voice came then , more faintly , `` Many happy returns of the day , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 42]: And now , a plaintive little whine sounded from below Penrod 's feet , and , looking down , he saw that Duke , his wistful , old , scraggly dog sat in the grass , gazing seekingly up at him .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 22]: The last shaft of sunshine of that day fell graciously and like a blessing upon the boy sitting on the fence .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 52]: Years afterward , a quiet sunset would recall to him sometimes the gentle evening of his twelfth birthday , and bring him the picture of his boy self , sitting in rosy light upon the fence , gazing pensively down upon his wistful , scraggly , little old dog , Duke .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 89]: But something else , surpassing , he would remember of that hour , for , in the side street , close by , a pink skirt flickered from behind a shade tree to the shelter of the fence , there was a gleam of amber curls , and Penrod started , as something like a tiny white wing fluttered by his head , and there came to his ears the sound of a light laugh and of light footsteps departing , the laughter tremulous , the footsteps fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 46]: In the grass , between Duke 's forepaws , there lay a white note , folded in the shape of a cocked hat , and the sun sent forth a final amazing glory as Penrod opened it and read : `` Your my bow . ''
