Parsing [sent. 1 len. 71]: THE AMERICAN CLAIMANT by Mark Twain 1892 EXPLANATORY The Colonel Mulberry Sellers here re-introduced to the public is the same person who appeared as Eschol Sellers in the first edition of the tale entitled `` The Gilded Age , '' years ago , and as Beriah Sellers in the subsequent editions of the same book , and finally as Mulberry Sellers in the drama played afterward by John T. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 48]: The name was changed from Eschol to Beriah to accommodate an Eschol Sellers who rose up out of the vasty deeps of uncharted space and preferred his request -- backed by threat of a libel suit -- then went his way appeased , and came no more .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 38]: In the play Beriah had to be dropped to satisfy another member of the race , and Mulberry was substituted in the hope that the objectors would be tired by that time and let it pass unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 31]: So far it has occupied the field in peace ; therefore we chance it again , feeling reasonably safe , this time , under shelter of the statute of limitations .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 3]: MARK TWAIN .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 4]: Hartford , 1891 .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 6]: THE WEATHER IN THIS BOOK .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 9]: No weather will be found in this book .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 12]: This is an attempt to pull a book through without weather .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 41]: It being the first attempt of the kind in fictitious literature , it may prove a failure , but it seemed worth the while of some dare-devil person to try it , and the author was in just the mood .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 25]: Many a reader who wanted to read a tale through was not able to do it because of delays on account of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 19]: Nothing breaks up an author 's progress like having to stop every few pages to fuss-up the weather .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 17]: Thus it is plain that persistent intrusions of weather are bad for both reader and author .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 12]: Of course weather is necessary to a narrative of human experience .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 4]: That is conceded .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 26]: But it ought to be put where it will not be in the way ; where it will not interrupt the flow of the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 21]: And it ought to be the ablest weather that can be had , not ignorant , poor-quality , amateur weather .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 19]: Weather is a literary specialty , and no untrained hand can turn out a good article of it .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 23]: The present author can do only a few trifling ordinary kinds of weather , and he can not do those very good .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 27]: So it has seemed wisest to borrow such weather as is necessary for the book from qualified and recognized experts -- giving credit , of course .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 19]: This weather will be found over in the back part of the book , out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 3]: See Appendix .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 19]: The reader is requested to turn over and help himself from time to time as he goes along .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 3]: CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: It is a matchless morning in rural England .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 32]: On a fair hill we see a majestic pile , the ivied walls and towers of Cholmondeley Castle , huge relic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 69]: This is one of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore , K. G. G. C. B. K. C. M. G. , etc. , etc. , etc. , etc. , etc. , who possesses twenty-two thousand acres of English land , owns a parish in London with two thousand houses on its lease-roll , and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred thousand pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 46]: The father and founder of this proud old line was William the Conqueror his very self ; the mother of it was not inventoried in history by name , she being merely a random episode and inconsequential , like the tanner 's daughter of Falaise .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 25]: In a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 46]: One of these persons is the old lord , tall , erect , square-shouldered , white-haired , stern-browed , a man who shows character in every feature , attitude , and movement , and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry fifty .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 24]: The other person is his only son and heir , a dreamy-eyed young fellow , who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 71]: Candor , kindliness , honesty , sincerity , simplicity , modesty -- it is easy to see that these are cardinal traits of his character ; and so when you have clothed him in the formidable components of his name , you somehow seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor : his name and style being the Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjorihanks Sellers Viscount-Berkeley , of Cholmondeley Castle , Warwickshire .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 16]: -LRB- Pronounced K'koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly , of Chumly Castle , Warrikshr . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 32]: He is standing by a great window , in an attitude suggestive of respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally respectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 23]: The father walks the floor as he talks , and his talk shows that his temper is away up toward summer heat .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 66]: `` Soft-spirited as you are , Berkeley , I am quite aware that when you have once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and justice require you to do , argument and reason are -LRB- for the time being , -RRB- wasted upon you -- yes , and ridicule ; persuasion , supplication , and command as well .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 47]: To my mind -- '' `` Father , if you will look at it without prejudice , without passion , you must concede that I am not doing a rash thing , a thoughtless , wilful thing , with nothing substantial behind it to justify it .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 33]: I did not create the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore ; I did not hunt for him , did not find him , did not obtrude him upon your notice .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 52]: He found himself , he injected himself into our lives -- '' `` And has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters , his wordy reasonings , his acres of tedious evidence , -- '' `` Which you would never read , would never consent to read .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 11]: Yet in common fairness he was entitled to a hearing .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 39]: That hearing would either prove he was the rightful earl -- in which case our course would be plain -- or it would prove that he was n't -- in which case our course would be equally plain .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 9]: I have read his evidences , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 12]: I have conned them well , studied them patiently and thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 12]: The chain seems to be complete , no important link wanting .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 9]: I believe he is the rightful earl . ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 14]: `` And I a usurper -- a -- nameless pauper , a tramp !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 9]: Consider what you are saying , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 41]: `` Father , if he is the rightful earl , would you , could you -- that fact being established -- consent to keep his titles and his properties from him a day , an hour , a minute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 11]: `` You are talking nonsense -- nonsense -- lurid idiotcy !
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 6]: Now , listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 16]: I will make a confession -- if you wish to call it by that name .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 36]: I did not read those evidences because I had no occasion to -- I was made familiar with them in the time of this claimant 's father and of my own father forty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 22]: This fellow 's predecessors have kept mine more or less familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 104]: The truth is , the rightful heir did go to America , with the Fairfax heir or about the same time -- but disappeared -- somewhere in the wilds of Virginia , got married , end began to breed savages for the Claimant market ; wrote no letters home ; was supposed to be dead ; his younger brother softly took possession ; presently the American did die , and straightway his eldest product put in his claim -- by letter -- letter still in existence -- and died before the uncle in-possession found time -- or maybe inclination -- to -- answer .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 26]: The infant son of that eldest product grew up -- long interval , you see -- and he took to writing letters and furnishing evidences .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 16]: Well , successor after successor has done the same , down to the present idiot .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 24]: It was a succession of paupers ; not one of them was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute suit .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 33]: The Fairfaxes kept their lordship alive , and so they have never lost it to this day , although they live in Maryland ; their friend lost his by his own neglect .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 37]: You perceive now , that the facts in this case bring us to precisely this result : morally the American tramp is rightful earl of Rossmore ; legally he has no more right than his dog .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 8]: There now -- are you satisfied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 56]: There was a pause , then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great oaken mantel and said , with a regretful note in his voice : `` Since the introduction of heraldic symbols , -- the motto of this house has been ` Suum cuique ' -- to every man his own .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 29]: By your own intrepidly frank confession , my lord , it is become a sarcasm : If Simon Lathers -- '' `` Keep that exasperating name to yourself !
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 30]: For ten years it has pestered my eye -- and tortured my ear ; till at last my very footfalls time themselves to the brain-racking rhythm of Simon Lathers !
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 4]: -- Simon Lathers !
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 4]: -- Simon Lathers !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 33]: And now , to make its presence in my soul eternal , immortal , imperishable , you have resolved to -- to -- what is it you have resolved to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 17]: `` To go to Simon Lathers , in America , and change places with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 11]: Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 7]: `` That is my purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 16]: `` Make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case in the Lords ? ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 12]: `` Ye -- s -- '' with hesitation and some embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 16]: `` By all that is amazing , I believe you are insane , my son .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 34]: See here -- have you been training with that ass again -- that radical , if you prefer the term , though the words are synonymous -- Lord Tanzy , of Tollmache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 18]: The son did not reply , and the old lord continued : `` Yes , you confess .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 66]: That puppy , that shame to his birth and caste , who holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation , all nobility a tinsel sham , all aristocratic institutions a fraud , all inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy , and no bread honest bread that a man does n't earn by his own work -- work , pah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 13]: -- and the old patrician brushed imaginary labor-dirt from his white hands .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 21]: `` You have come to hold just those opinions yourself , suppose , '' -- he added with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 28]: A faint flush in the younger man 's cheek told that the shot had hit and hurt ; but he answered with dignity : `` I have .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 10]: I say it without shame -- I feel none .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 15]: And now my reason for resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 55]: I wish to retire from what to me is a false existence , a false position , and begin my life over again -- begin it right -- begin it on the level of mere manhood , unassisted by factitious aids , and succeed or fail by pure merit or the want of it .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 52]: I will go to America , where all men are equal and all have an equal chance ; I will live or die , sink or swim , win or lose as just a man -- that alone , and not a single helping gaud or fiction back of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: `` Hear , hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 28]: The two men looked each other steadily in the eye a moment or two , then the elder one added , musingly , `` Ab-so-lutely cra-zy-ab-solutely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 51]: After another silence , he said , as one who , long troubled by clouds , detects a ray of sunshine , `` Well , there will be one satisfaction -- Simon Lathets will come here to enter into his own , and I will drown him in the horsepond .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 96]: That poor devil -- always so humble in his letters , so pitiful , so deferential ; so steeped in reverence for our great line and lofty-station ; so anxious to placate us , so prayerful for recognition as a relative , a bearer in his veins of our sacred blood -- and withal so poor , so needy , so threadbare and pauper-shod as to raiment , so despised , so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the lewd American scum around him -- ah , the vulgar , crawling , insufferable tramp !
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 13]: To read one of his cringing , nauseating letters -- well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 61]: This to a splendid flunkey , all in inflamed plush and buttons and knee-breeches as to his trunk , and a glinting white frost-work of ground-glass paste as to his head , who stood with his heels together and the upper half of him bent forward , a salver in his hands : `` The letters , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 10]: My lord took them , and the servant disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 9]: `` Among the rest , an American letter .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 7]: From the tramp , of course .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 8]: Jove , but here 's a change !
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 22]: No brown paper envelope this time , filched from a shop , and carrying the shop 's advertisement in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 55]: Oh , no , a proper enough envelope -- with a most ostentatiously broad mourning border -- for his cat , perhaps , since he was a bachelor -- and fastened with red wax -- a batch of it as big as a half-crown -- and -- and -- our crest for a seal !
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 5]: -- motto and all .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 29]: And the ignorant , sprawling hand is gone ; he sports a secretary , evidently -- a secretary with a most confident swing and flourish to his pen .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 19]: Oh indeed , our fortunes are improving over there -- our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 10]: `` Read it , my lord , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 8]: `` Yes , this time I will .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 11]: For the sake of the cat : '' 14,042 SIXTEENTH .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 7]: STREET , WASHINGTON , May 2 .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 132]: It is my painful duty to announce to you that the head of our illustrious house is no more -- The Right Honourable , The Most Noble , The Most Puissant Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore having departed this life -LRB- `` Gone at last -- this is unspeakably precious news , my son , '' -RRB- at his seat in the environs of the hamlet of Duffy 's Corners in the grand old State of Arkansas , -- and his twin brother with him , both being crushed by a log at a smoke-house-raising , owing to carelessness on the part of all present , referable to over-confidence and gaiety induced by overplus of sour-mash -- -LRB- `` Extolled be sour-mash , whatever that may be , eh Berkeley ? '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 52]: five days ago , with no scion of our ancient race present to close his eyes and inter him with the honors due his historic name and lofty rank -- in fact , he is on the ice yet , him and his brother -- friends took a collection for it .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 21]: But I shall take immediate occasion to have their noble remains shipped to you -LRB- `` Great heavens ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 19]: for interment , with due ceremonies and solemnities , in the family vault or mausoleum of our house .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 26]: Meantime I shall put up a pair of hatchments on my house-front , and you will of course do the same at your several seats .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 70]: I have also to remind you that by this sad disaster I as sole heir , inherit and become seized of all the titles , honors , lands , and goods of our lamented relative , and must of necessity , painful as the duty is , shortly require at the bar of the Lords restitution of these dignities and properties , now illegally enjoyed by your titular lordship .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 26]: With assurance of my distinguished consideration and warm cousinly regard , I remain Your titular lordship 's Most obedient servant , Mulberry Sellers Earl Rossmore .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: `` Im-mense !
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 7]: Come , this one 's interesting .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 22]: Why , Berkeley , his breezy impudence is -- is -- why , it 's colossal , it 's sublime . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 13]: `` No , this one does n't seem to cringe much . ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 15]: `` Cringe -- why , he does n't know the meaning of the word .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 2]: Hatchments !
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 11]: To commemorate that sniveling tramp and his , fraternal duplicate .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 10]: And he is going to send me the remains .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 16]: The late Claimant was a fool , but plainly this new one 's a maniac .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 4]: What a name !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 21]: Mulberry Sellers -- there 's music for you , Simon Lathers -- Mulberry Sellers -- Mulberry Sellers -- Simon Lathers .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: Sounds like machinery working and churning .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 11]: Simon Lathers , Mulberry Sel -- Are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 10]: `` If I have your leave , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 14]: The old gentleman stood musing some time , after his son was gone .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 15]: This was his thought : `` He is a good boy , and lovable .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 23]: Let him take his own course -- as it would profit nothing to oppose him -- make things worse , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 20]: My arguments and his aunt 's persuasions have failed ; let us see what America can do for us .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 20]: Let us see what equality and hard-times can effect for the mental health of a brain-sick young British lord .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 10]: Going to renounce his lordship and be a man !
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 3]: Yas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 47]: COLONEL MULBERRY SELLERS -- this was some days before he wrote his letter to Lord Rossmore -- was seated in his `` library , '' which was also his `` drawing-room '' and was also his `` picture gallery '' and likewise his `` work-shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 20]: Sometimes he called it by one of these names , sometimes by another , according to occasion and circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 25]: He was constructing what seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy ; and was apparently very much interested in his work .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 25]: He was a white-headed man , now , but otherwise he was as young , alert , buoyant , visionary and enterprising as ever .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 21]: His loving old wife sat near by , contentedly knitting and thinking , with a cat asleep in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 49]: The room was large , light , and had a comfortable look , in fact a home-like look , though the furniture was of a humble sort and not over abundant , and the knickknacks and things that go to adorn a living-room not plenty and not costly .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 35]: But there were natural flowers , and there was an abstract and unclassifiable something about the place which betrayed the presence in the house of somebody with a happy taste and an effective touch .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 60]: Even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence ; in fact they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room -- a fascination , anyway ; for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to gaze and suffer till he died -- you have seen that kind of pictures .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 21]: Some of these terrors were landscapes , some libeled the sea , some were ostensible portraits , all were crimes .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 36]: All the portraits were recognizable as dead Americans of distinction , and yet , through labeling added , by a daring hand , they were all doing duty here as `` Earls of Rossmore . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 29]: The newest one had left the works as Andrew Jackson , but was doing its best now , as `` Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore , Present Earl . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 12]: On one wall was a cheap old railroad map of Warwickshire .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 11]: This had been newly labeled `` The Rossmore Estates . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 34]: On the opposite wall was another map , and this was the most imposing decoration of the establishment and the first to catch a stranger 's attention , because of its great size .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 25]: It had once borne simply the title SIBERIA ; but now the word `` FUTURE '' had been written in front of that word .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 32]: There were other additions , in red ink -- many cities , with great populations set down , scattered over the vast-country at points where neither cities nor populations exist to-day .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 43]: One of these cities , with population placed at 1,500,000 , bore the name `` Libertyorloffskoizalinski , '' and there was a still more populous one , centrally located and marked `` Capital , '' which bore the name `` Freedomolovnaivanovich . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 40]: The `` mansion '' -- the Colonel 's usual name for the house -- was a rickety old two-story frame of considerable size , which had been painted , some time or other , but had nearly forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 19]: It was away out in the ragged edge of Washington and had once been somebody 's country place .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 28]: It had a neglected yard around it , with a paling fence that needed straightening up , in places , and a gate that would stay shut .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 9]: By the door-post were several modest tin signs .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 18]: `` Col. Mulberry Sellers , Attorney at Law and Claim Agent , '' was the principal one .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 23]: One learned from the others that the Colonel was a Materializer , a Hypnotizer , a Mind-Cure dabbler ; and so on .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 13]: For he was a man who could always find things to do .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 32]: A white-headed negro man , with spectacles and damaged white cotton gloves appeared in the presence , made a stately obeisance and announced : `` Marse Washington Hawkins , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 4]: `` Great Scott !
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 13]: Show him in , Dan ` l , show him in . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 47]: The Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment , and the next moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish , discouraged-looking man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty years old , but whose hair swore to a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 21]: `` Well , well , well , Washington , my boy , it is good to look at you again .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 12]: Sit down , sit down , and make yourself at home .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 34]: There , now -- why , you look perfectly natural ; aging a little , just a little , but you 'd have known him anywhere , would n't you , Polly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 21]: `` Oh , yes , Berry , he 's just like his pa would have looked if he 'd lived .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 10]: Dear , dear , where have you dropped from ?
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 26]: Let me see , how long is it since -- '' `` I should say it 's all of fifteen years , Mrs. Sellers . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 13]: `` Well , well , how time does get away with us .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 60]: Yes , and oh , the changes that -- '' There was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip , the men waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on ; but after a little struggle she turned away , with her apron to her eyes , and softly disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 25]: `` Seeing you made her think of the children , poor thing -- dear , dear , they 're all dead but the youngest .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 72]: `` But banish care , it 's no time for it now -- on with the dance , let joy be unconfined is my motto , whether there 's any dance to dance ; or any joy to unconfine -- you 'll be the healthier for it every time , -- every time , Washington -- it 's my experience , and I 've seen a good deal of this world .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 26]: Come -- where have you disappeared to all these years , and are you from there , now , or where are you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 13]: `` I do n't quite think you would ever guess , Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: Cherokee Strip . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 5]: `` My land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 7]: `` Sure as you live . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 7]: `` You ca n't mean it .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 6]: Actually living out there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 50]: `` Well , yes , if a body may call it that ; though it 's a pretty strong term for ` dobies and jackass rabbits , boiled beans and slap-jacks , depression , withered hopes , poverty in all its varieties -- '' `` Louise out there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 8]: `` Yes , and the children . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 6]: `` Out there now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 14]: `` Yes , I could n't afford to bring them with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 17]: `` Oh , I see , -- you had to come -- claim against the government .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 13]: Make yourself perfectly easy -- I 'll take care of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 12]: `` But it is n't a claim against the government . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 5]: Want to be postmaster ?
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 5]: Leave it to me .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 6]: I 'll fix it . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 14]: `` But it is n't postmaster -- you 're all astray yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 21]: `` Well , good gracious , Washington , why do n't you come out and tell me what it is ?
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 20]: What , do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an old friend like me , for ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 76]: Do n't you reckon I can keep a se -- '' `` There 's no secret about it -- you merely do n't give me a chance to -- '' `` Now look here , old friend , I know the human race ; and I know that when a man comes to Washington , I do n't care if it 's from heaven , let alone Cherokee-Strip , it 's because he wants something .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 84]: And I know that as a rule he 's not going to get it ; that he 'll stay and try -- for another thing and wo n't get that ; the same luck with the next and the next and the next ; and keeps on till he strikes bottom , and is too poor and ashamed to go back , even to Cherokee Strip ; and at last his heart breaks -- and they take up a collection and bury him .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 15]: There -- do n't interrupt me , I know what I 'm talking about .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 11]: Happy and prosperous in the Far West was n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 4]: You know that .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 25]: Principal citizen of Hawkeye , looked up to by everybody , kind of an autocrat , actually a kind of an autocrat , Washington .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 46]: Well , nothing would do but I must go Minister to St. James , the Governor and everybody insisting , you know , and so at last I consented -- no getting out of it , had to do it , so here I came .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 7]: A day too late , Washington .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 23]: Think of that -- what little things change the world 's history -- yes , sir , the place had been filled .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 9]: Well , there I was , you see .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 9]: I offered to compromise and go to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 29]: The President was very sorry and all that , but that place , you see , did n't belong to the West , so there I was again .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 67]: There was no help for it , so I had to stoop a little -- we all reach the day some time or other when we 've got to do that , Washington , and it 's not a bad thing for us , either , take it by and large and all around -- I had to stoop a little and offer to take Constantinople .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 68]: Washington , consider this -- for it 's perfectly true -- within a month I asked for China ; within another month I begged for Japan ; one year later I was away down , down , down , supplicating with tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift of the government of the United States -- Flint-Picker in the cellars of the War Department .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 10]: And by George I did n't get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 4]: `` Flint-Picker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 12]: Office established in the time of the Revolution , last century .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 12]: The musket-flints for the military posts were supplied from the capitol .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 61]: They do it yet ; for although the flint-arm has gone out and the forts have tumbled down , the decree has n't been repealed -- been overlooked and forgotten , you see -- and so the vacancies where old Ticonderoga and others used to stand , still get their six quarts of gun-flints a year just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 37]: Washington said musingly after a pause : `` How strange it seems -- to start for Minister to England at twenty thousand a year and fail for flintpicker at -- '' `` Three dollars a week .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 34]: It 's human life , Washington -- just an epitome of human ambition , and struggle , and the outcome : you aim for the palace and get drowned in the sewer . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 6]: There was another meditative silence .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 45]: Then Washington said , with earnest compassion in his voice -- `` And so , after coming here , against your inclination , to satisfy your sense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor , you get absolutely nothing for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 4]: `` Nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 18]: The Colonel had to get up and stand , to get room for his amazement to expand .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 5]: `` Nothing , Washington ?
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 33]: I ask you this : to be a perpetual Member and the only Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic Body accredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 9]: It was Washington 's turn to be amazed .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 27]: He was stricken dumb ; but the wide-eyed wonder , the reverent admiration expressed in his face were more eloquent than any words could have been .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 16]: The Colonel 's wounded spirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 31]: He leaned forward and said impressively : `` What was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an experience without precedent in the history of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 88]: -- a man made permanently and diplomatically sacred , so to speak , by having been connected , temporarily , through solicitation , with every single diplomatic post in the roster of this government , from Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James all the way down to Consul to a guano rock in the Straits of Sunda -- salary payable in guano -- which disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day before they got down to my name in the list of applicants .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 25]: Certainly something august enough to be answerable to the size of this unique and memorable experience was my due , and I got it .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 62]: By the common voice of this community , by acclamation of the people , that mighty utterance which brushes aside laws and legislation , and from whose decrees there is no appeal , I was named Perpetual Member of the Diplomatic Body representing the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the globe near the republican court of the United States of America .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: And they brought me home with a torchlight procession . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 11]: `` It is wonderful , Colonel , simply wonderful . ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 13]: `` It 's the loftiest official position in the whole earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 12]: `` I should think so -- and the most commanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 7]: `` You have named the word .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 4]: Think of it .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 20]: I frown , and there is war ; I smile , and contending nations lay down their arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 5]: `` It is awful .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 7]: The responsibility , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 5]: `` It is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 21]: Responsibility is no burden to me ; I am used to it ; have always been used to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 8]: `` And the work -- the work !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: Do you have to attend all the sittings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 5]: `` Who , I ?
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 15]: Does the Emperor of Russia attend the conclaves of the governors of the provinces ?
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: He sits at home , and indicates his pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 13]: Washington was silent a moment , then a deep sigh escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: `` How proud I was an hour ago ; how paltry seems my little promotion now !
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 20]: Colonel , the reason I came to Washington is , -- I am Congressional Delegate from Cherokee Strip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 27]: The Colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious enthusiasm : `` Give me your hand , my boy -- this is immense news !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 8]: I congratulate you with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 5]: My prophecies stand confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 8]: I always said it was in you .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 14]: I always said you were born for high distinction and would achieve it .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 9]: You ask Polly if I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 9]: Washington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 11]: `` Why , Colonel , there 's nothing to it .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 40]: That little narrow , desolate , unpeopled , oblong streak of grass and gravel , lost in the remote wastes of the vast continent -- why , it 's like representing a billiard table -- a discarded one . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 22]: `` Tut-tut , it 's a great , it 's a staving preferment , and just opulent with influence here . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 13]: `` Shucks , Colonel , I have n't even a vote . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 11]: `` That 's nothing ; you can make speeches . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 7]: `` No , I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 56]: The population 's only two hundred -- '' `` That 's all right , that 's all right -- '' `` And they had n't any right to elect me ; we 're not even a territory , there 's no Organic Act , the government has n't any official knowledge of us whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 11]: `` Never mind about that ; I 'll fix that .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 17]: I 'll rush the thing through , I 'll get you organized in no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 6]: `` Will you , Colonel ?
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 35]: -- it 's too good of you ; but it 's just your old sterling self , the same old ever-faithful friend , '' and the grateful tears welled up in Washington 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 18]: `` It 's just as good as done , my boy , just as good as done .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 3]: Shake hands .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 18]: We 'll hitch teams together , you and I , and we 'll make things hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 68]: Mrs. Sellers returned , now , with her composure restored , and began to ask after Hawkins 's wife , and about his children , and the number of them , and so on , and her examination of the witness resulted in a circumstantial history of the family 's ups and downs and driftings to and fro in the far West during the previous fifteen years .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 22]: There was a message , now , from out back , and Colonel Sellers went out there in answer to it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 19]: Hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the world had been using the Colonel during the past half-generation .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 34]: `` Oh , it 's been using him just the same ; it could n't change its way of using him if it wanted to , for he would n't let it . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 11]: `` I can easily believe that , Mrs. Sellers . ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 29]: `` Yes , you see , he does n't change , himself -- not the least little bit in the world -- he 's always Mulberry Sellers . ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 9]: `` I can see that plain enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 38]: `` Just the same old scheming , generous , good-hearted , moonshiny , hopeful , no-account failure he always was , and still everybody likes him just as well as if he was the shiningest success . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 71]: `` They always did : and it was natural , because he was so obliging and accommodating , and had something about him that made it kind of easy to ask help of him , or favors -- you did n't feel shy , you know , or have that wish -- you -- did n't -- have -- to -- try feeling that you have with other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 55]: `` It 's just so , yet ; and a body wonders at it , too , because he 's been shamefully treated , many times , by people that had used him for a ladder to climb up by , and then kicked him down when they did n't need him any more .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 53]: For a time you can see he 's hurt , his pride 's wounded , because he shrinks away from that thing and do n't want to talk about it -- and so I used to think now he 's learned something and he 'll be more careful hereafter -- but laws !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 41]: in a couple of weeks he 's forgotten all about it , and any selfish tramp out of nobody knows where can come and put up a poor mouth and walk right into his heart with his boots on . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 11]: `` It must try your patience pretty sharply sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 23]: `` Oh , no , I 'm used to it ; and I 'd rather have him so than the other way .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 23]: When I call him a failure , I mean to the world he 's a failure ; he is n't to me .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 14]: I do n't know as I want him different much different , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 38]: I have to scold him some , snarl at him , you might even call it , but I reckon I 'd do that just the same , if he was different -- it 's my make .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 25]: But I 'm a good deal less snarly and more contented when he 's a failure than I am when he is n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 15]: `` Then he is n't always a failure , '' said Hawking , brightening .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 3]: `` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 7]: Oh , bless you , no .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 15]: He makes a strike , as he calls it , from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 9]: Then 's my time to fret and fuss .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: For the money just flies -- first come first served .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 68]: Straight off , he loads up the house with cripples and idiots and stray cats and all the different kinds of poor wrecks that other people do n't want and he does , and then when the poverty comes again I 've got to clear the most of them out or we 'd starve ; and that distresses him , and me the same , of course .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 115]: `` Here 's old Dan ' l and old Jinny , that the sheriff sold south one of the times that we got bankrupted before the war -- they came wandering back after the peace , worn out and used up on the cotton plantations , helpless , and not another lick of work left in their old hides for the rest of this earthly pilgrimage -- and we so pinched , oh so pinched for the very crumbs to keep life in us , and he just flung the door wide , and the way he received them you 'd have thought they had come straight down from heaven in answer to prayer .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 29]: I took him one side and said , ` Mulberry we ca n't have them -- we 've nothing for ourselves -- we ca n't feed them . '
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 16]: He looked at me kind of hurt , and said , ` Turn them out ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 66]: -- and they 've come to me just as confident and trusting as -- as -- why Polly , I must have bought that confidence sometime or other a long time ago , and given my note , so to speak -- you do n't get such things as a gift -- and how am I going to go back on a debt like that ?
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 59]: And you see , they 're so poor , and old , and friendless , and -- ' But I was ashamed by that time , and shut him off , and somehow felt a new courage in me , and so I said , softly , ` We 'll keep them -- the Lord will provide . '
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 34]: He was glad , and started to blurt out one of those over-confident speeches of his , but checked himself in time , and said humbly , ' I will , anyway . '
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 9]: It was years and years and years ago .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 12]: Well , you see those old wrecks are here yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 10]: `` But do n't they do your housework ? ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 3]: `` Laws !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: The idea .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 21]: They would if they could , poor old things , and perhaps they think they do do some of it .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 6]: But it 's a superstition .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 52]: Dan ' l waits on the front door , and sometimes goes on an errand ; and sometimes you 'll see one or both of them letting on to dust around in here -- but that 's because there 's something they want to hear about and mix their gabble into .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 13]: And they 're always around at meals , for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 36]: But the fact is , we have to keep a young negro girl just to take care of them , and a negro woman to do the housework and help take care of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 15]: `` Well , they ought to be tolerably happy , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 8]: `` It 's no name for it .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 115]: They quarrel together pretty much all the time -- most always about religion , because Dan ` l 's a Dunker Baptist and Jinny 's a shouting Methodist , and Jinny believes in special Providences and Dan ' l do n't , because he thinks he 's a kind of a free-thinker -- and they play and sing plantation hymns together , and talk and chatter just eternally and forever , and are sincerely fond of each other and think the world of Mulberry , and he puts up patiently with all their spoiled ways and foolishness , and so -- ah , well , they 're happy enough if it comes to that .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 13]: And I do n't mind -- I 've got used to it .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 35]: I can get used to anything , with Mulberry to help ; and the fact is , I do n't much care what happens , so long as he 's spared to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 18]: `` Well , here 's to him , and hoping he 'll make another strike soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 22]: `` And rake in the lame , the halt and the blind , and turn the house into a hospital again ?
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 7]: It 's what he would do .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: I 've seen aplenty of that and more .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 23]: No , Washington , I want his strikes to be mighty moderate ones the rest of the way down the vale . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 53]: `` Well , then , big strike or little strike , or no strike at all , here 's hoping he 'll never lack for friends -- and I do n't reckon he ever will while there 's people around who know enough to -- '' `` Him lack for friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 32]: and she tilted her head up with a frank pride -- `` why , Washington , you ca n't name a man that 's anybody that is n't fond of him .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 26]: I 'll tell you privately , that I 've had Satan 's own time to keep them from appointing him to some office or other .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 33]: They knew he 'd no business with an office , just as well as I did , but he 's the hardest man to refuse anything to , a body ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 6]: Mulberry Sellers with an office !
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 11]: laws goodness , you know what that would be like .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 18]: Why , they 'd come from the ends of the earth to see a circus like that .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 17]: I 'd just as lieves be married to Niagara Falls , and done with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 27]: After a reflective pause she added -- having wandered back , in the interval , to the remark that had been her text : `` Friends ?
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 75]: -- oh , indeed , no man ever had more ; and such friends : Grant , Sherman , Sheridan , Johnston , Longstreet , Lee -- many 's the time they 've sat in that chair you 're sitting in -- '' Hawkins was out of it instantly , and contemplating it with a reverential surprise , and with the awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground -- `` They ! ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 16]: `` Oh , indeed , yes , a many and a many a time . ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 52]: He continued to gaze at the chair fascinated , magnetized ; and for once in his life that continental stretch of dry prairie which stood for his imagination was afire , and across it was marching a slanting flamefront that joined its wide horizons together and smothered the skies with smoke .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 44]: He was experiencing what one or another drowsing , geographically ignorant alien experiences every day in the year when he turns a dull and indifferent eye out of the car window and it falls upon a certain station-sign which reads `` Stratford-on-Avon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 35]: Mrs. Sellers went gossiping comfortably along : `` Oh , they like to hear him talk , especially if their load is getting rather heavy on one shoulder and they want to shift it .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 32]: He 's all air , you know , -- breeze , you may say -- and he freshens them up ; it 's a trip to the country , they say .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 45]: Many a time he 's made General Grant laugh -- and that 's a tidy job , I can tell you , and as for Sheridan , his eye lights up and he listens to Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 23]: You see , the charm about Mulberry is , he is so catholic and unprejudiced that he fits in anywhere and everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 13]: It makes him powerful good company , and as popular as scandal .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 21]: You go to the White House when the President 's holding a general reception -- sometime when Mulberry 's there .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 21]: Why , dear me , you ca n't tell which of them it is that 's holding that reception . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 15]: `` Well , he certainly is a remarkable man -- and he always was .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 5]: Is he religious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 37]: `` Clear to his marrow -- does more thinking and reading on that subject than any other except Russia and Siberia : thrashes around over the whole field , too ; nothing bigoted about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 7]: `` What is his religion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 38]: `` He -- '' She stopped , and was lost for a moment or two in thinking , then she said , with simplicity , `` I think he was a Mohammedan or something last week . ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 32]: Washington started down town , now , to bring his trunk , for the hospitable Sellerses would listen to no excuses ; their house must be his home during the session .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 11]: The Colonel returned presently and resumed work upon his plaything .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 8]: It was finished when Washington got back .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 15]: `` There it is , '' said the Colonel , `` all finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 9]: `` What is it for , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 9]: `` Oh , it 's just a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 7]: Toy to amuse the children . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 4]: Washington examined it .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: `` It seems to be a puzzle . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 9]: `` Yes , that 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 8]: I call it Pigs in the Clover .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 15]: Put them in -- see if you can put them in the pen . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 14]: After many failures Washington succeeded , and was as pleased as a child .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 26]: `` It 's wonderfully ingenious , Colonel , it 's ever so clever and interesting -- why , I could play with it all day .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 10]: What are you going to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 5]: `` Oh , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: Patent it and throw it aside . ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 10]: `` Do n't you do anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 8]: There 's money in that thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 30]: A compassionate look traveled over the Colonel 's countenance , and he said : `` Money -- yes ; pin money : a couple of hundred thousand , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 4]: Not more . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 5]: Washington 's eyes blazed .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: `` A couple of hundred thousand dollars !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 8]: do you call that pin money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 42]: The colonel rose and tip-toed his way across the room , closed a door that was slightly ajar , tip-toed his way to his seat again , and said , under his breath : `` You can keep a secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 12]: Washington nodded his affirmative , he was too awed to speak .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 13]: `` You have heard of materialization -- materialization of departed spirits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 6]: Washington had heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 15]: `` And probably did n't believe in it ; and quite right , too .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 102]: The thing as practised by ignorant charlatans is unworthy of attention or respect -- where there 's a dim light and a dark cabinet , and a parcel of sentimental gulls gathered together , with their faith and their shudders and their tears all ready , and one and the same fatty degeneration of protoplasm and humbug comes out and materializes himself into anybody you want , grandmother , grandchild , brother-in-law , Witch of Endor , John Milton , Siamese twins , Peter the Great , and all such frantic nonsense -- no , that is all foolish and pitiful .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 30]: But when a man that is competent brings the vast powers of science to bear , it 's a different matter , a totally different matter , you see .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 11]: The spectre that answers that call has come to stay .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 11]: Do you note the commercial value of that detail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 21]: `` Well , I -- the -- the truth is , that I do n't quite know that I do .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 34]: Do you mean that such , being permanent , not transitory , would give more general satisfaction , and so enhance the price -- of tickets to the show -- '' `` Show ?
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 23]: Folly -- listen to me ; and get a good grip on your breath , for you are going to need it .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 25]: Within three days I shall have completed my method , and then -- let the world stand aghast , for it shall see marvels .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 29]: Washington , within three days -- ten at the outside -- you shall see me call the dead of any century , and they will arise and walk .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 2]: Walk ?
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: -- they shall walk forever , and never die again .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 13]: Walk with all the muscle and spring of their pristine vigor . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 3]: `` Colonel !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 10]: Indeed it does take one 's breath away . ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 13]: `` Now do you see the money that 's in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 17]: `` I 'm -- well , I 'm -- not really sure that I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 6]: Great Scott , look here .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 17]: I shall have a monopoly ; they 'll all belong to me , wo n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 10]: Two thousand policemen in the city of New York .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 7]: Wages , four dollars a day .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: I 'll replace them with dead ones at half the money .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 5]: `` Oh , prodigious !
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 6]: I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 6]: F-o-u-r thousand dollars a day .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 7]: Now I do begin to see !
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 7]: But will dead policemen answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: `` Have n't they -- up to this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 20]: `` Well , if you put it that way -- '' `` Put it any way you want to .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 14]: Modify it to suit yourself , and my lads shall still be superior .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 78]: They wo n't eat , they wo n't drink -- do n't need those things ; they wo n't wink for cash at gambling dens and unlicensed rum-holes , they wo n't spark the scullery maids ; and moreover the bands of toughs that ambuscade them on lonely beats , and cowardly shoot and knife them will only damage the uniforms and not live long enough to get more than a momentary satisfaction out of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 30]: `` Why , Colonel , if you can furnish policemen , then of course -- '' `` Certainly -- I can furnish any line of goods that 's wanted .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 19]: Take the army , for instance -- now twenty-five thousand men ; expense , twenty-two millions a year .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 62]: I will dig up the Romans , I will resurrect the Greeks , I will furnish the government , for ten millions a year , ten thousand veterans drawn from the victorious legions of all the ages -- soldiers that will chase Indians year in and year out on materialized horses , and cost never a cent for rations or repairs .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 20]: The armies of Europe cost two billions a year now -- I will replace them all for a billion .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 62]: I will dig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes , and furnish this country with a Congress that knows enough to come in out of the rain -- a thing that 's never happened yet , since the Declaration of Independence , and never will happen till these practically dead people are replaced with the genuine article .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 76]: I will restock the thrones of Europe with the best brains and the best morals that all the royal sepulchres of all the centuries can furnish -- which is n't promising very much -- and I 'll divide the wages and the civil list , fair and square , merely taking my half and -- '' `` Colonel , if the half of this is true , there 's millions in it -- millions . ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 13]: `` Billions in it -- billions ; that 's what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 58]: Why , look here ; the thing is so close at hand , so imminent , so absolutely immediate , that if a man were to come to me now and say , Colonel , I am a little short , and if you could lend me a couple of billion dollars for -- come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 7]: This in answer to a knock .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 55]: An energetic looking man bustled in with a big pocket-book in his hand , took a paper from it and presented it , with the curt remark : `` Seventeenth and last call -- you want to out with that three dollars and forty cents this time without fail , Colonel Mulberry Sellers . ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 30]: The Colonel began to slap this pocket and that one , and feel here and there and everywhere , muttering : `` What have I done with that wallet ?
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 45]: -- let me see -- um -- not here , not there -- Oh , I must have left it in the kitchen ; I 'll just run and -- '' `` No you wo n't -- you 'll stay right where you are .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 13]: And you 're going to disgorge , too -- this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 8]: Washington innocently offered to go and look .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 53]: When he was gone the Colonel said : `` The fact is , I 've got to throw myself on your indulgence just this once more , Suggs ; you see the remittances I was expecting -- '' `` Hang the remittances -- it 's too stale -- it wo n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 8]: The Colonel glanced about him in despair .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 23]: Then his face lighted ; he ran to the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 31]: Then he brought it reverently , offered it to the collector , averted his face and said : `` Take it , but do n't let me see it go .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 20]: It 's the sole remaining Rembrandt that -- '' `` Rembrandt be damned , it 's a chromo . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 14]: `` Oh , do n't speak of it so , I beg you .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 24]: It 's the only really great original , the only supreme example of that mighty school of art which -- '' `` Art !
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 21]: It 's the sickest looking thing I -- '' The colonel was already bringing another horror and tenderly dusting it .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 30]: `` Take this one too -- the gem of my collection -- the only genuine Fra Angelico that -- '' `` Illuminated liver-pad , that 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 19]: Give it here -- good day -- people will think I 've robbed a ' nigger barber-shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 31]: As he slammed the door behind him the Colonel shouted with an anguished accent -- `` Do please cover them up -- do n't let the damp get at them .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 14]: The delicate tints in the Angelico -- '' But the man was gone .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 51]: Washington re-appeared and said he had looked everywhere , and so had Mrs. Sellers and the servants , but in vain ; and went on to say he wished he could get his eye on a certain man about this time -- no need to hunt up that pocket-book then .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 9]: The Colonel 's interest was awake at once .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 5]: `` What man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 17]: `` One-armed Pete they call him out there -- out in the Cherokee country I mean .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 7]: Robbed the bank in Tahlequah . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 9]: `` Do they have banks in Tahlequah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 8]: `` Yes -- a bank , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: He was suspected of robbing it .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 12]: Whoever did it got away with more than twenty thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 8]: They offered a reward of five thousand .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 14]: I believe I saw that very man , on my way east . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 7]: `` No -- is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 36]: `` I certainly saw a man on the train , the first day I struck the railroad , that answered the description pretty exactly -- at least as to clothes and a lacking arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you get him arrested and claim the reward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 5]: `` I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 10]: I had to get a requisition , of course .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 14]: But I meant to stay by him till I got my chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 14]: `` Well , he left the train during the night some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 12]: `` Oh , hang it , that 's too bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 9]: `` Not so very bad , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 24]: `` Because he came down to Baltimore in the very train I was in , though I did n't know it in time .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 23]: As we moved out of the station I saw him going toward the iron gate with a satchel in his hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 8]: `` Good ; we 'll catch him .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: Let 's lay a plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 9]: `` Send description to the Baltimore police ? ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 9]: `` Why , what are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 10]: Do you want them to get the reward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: `` What shall we do , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 4]: The Colonel reflected .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: `` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 8]: Put a personal in the Baltimore Sun .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 15]: Word it like this : `` A. DROP ME A LINE , PETE . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 4]: `` Hold on .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 7]: Which arm has he lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 5]: `` The right . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 23]: Now then -- `` A. DROP ME A LINE , PETE , EVEN IF YOU HAVE to write with your left hand .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: Address X. Y. Z. , General Postoffice , Washington .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 6]: From YOU KNOW WHO . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 9]: `` There -- that 'll fetch him . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 12]: `` But he wo n't know who -- will he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 15]: `` No , but he 'll want to know , wo n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 12]: `` Why , certainly -- I did n't think of that .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 8]: What made you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 6]: `` Knowledge of human curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 8]: Strong trait , very strong trait . ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 29]: `` Now I 'll go to my room and write it out and enclose a dollar and tell them to print it to the worth of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 6]: The day wore itself out .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 64]: After dinner the two friends put in a long and harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand dollars reward which they were going to get when they should find One-Armed Pete , and catch him , and prove him to be the right person , and extradite him , and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 26]: But there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 29]: Finally , Mrs. Sellers grew very weary of it all , and said : `` What is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it 's caught ? ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 17]: Then the matter was dropped , for the time being , and all went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 50]: Next morning , being persuaded by Hawkins , the colonel made drawings and specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy puzzle , and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what chance there might be to do something with it commercially .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 8]: He did not have to go far .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 34]: In a small old wooden shanty which had once been occupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keen-eyed Yankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other second-hand furniture .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 47]: This man examined the toy indifferently ; attempted to do the puzzle ; found it not so easy as he had expected ; grew more interested , and finally emphatically so ; achieved a success at last , and asked : `` Is it patented ? ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 6]: `` Patent applied for . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 5]: `` That will answer .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 8]: What do you want for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 8]: `` What will it retail for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 11]: `` Well , twenty-five cents , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: `` What will you give for the exclusive right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 26]: `` I could n't give twenty dollars , if I had to pay cash down ; but I 'll tell you what I 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 19]: I 'll make it and market it , and pay you five cents royalty on each one . ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 3]: Washington sighed .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 10]: Another dream disappeared ; no money in the thing .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 13]: So he said : `` All right , take it at that .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 6]: Draw me a paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 55]: He went his way with the paper , and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make room for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest his half of the reward , in case a partnership investment satisfactory to both beneficiaries could not be hit upon .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 32]: He had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with grief and booming with glad excitement -- working both these emotions successfully , sometimes separately , sometimes together .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 43]: He fell on Hawkins 's neck sobbing , and said : `` Oh , mourn with me my friend , mourn for my desolate house : death has smitten my last kinsman and I am Earl of Rossmore -- congratulate me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 46]: He turned to his wife , who had entered while this was going on , put his arms about her and said -- `` You will bear up , for my sake , my lady -- it had to happen , it was decreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 16]: She bore up very well , and said : `` It 's no great loss .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 21]: Simon Lathers was a poor well-meaning useless thing and no account , and his brother never was worth shucks . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 58]: The rightful earl continued : `` I am too much prostrated by these conflicting griefs and joys to be able to concentrate my mind upon affairs ; I will ask our good friend here to break the news by wire or post to the Lady Gwendolen and instruct her to -- '' `` What Lady Gwendolen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 9]: `` Our poor daughter , who , alas !
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 6]: -- '' `` Sally Sellers ?
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 10]: Mulberry Sellers , are you losing your mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 27]: `` There -- please do not forget who you are , and who I am ; remember your own dignity , be considerate also of mine .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 17]: It were best to cease from using my family name , now , Lady Rossmore . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 9]: `` Goodness gracious , well , I never !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 9]: What am I to call you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 63]: `` In private , the ordinary terms of endearment will still be admissible , to some degree ; but in public it will be more becoming if your ladyship will speak to me as my lord , or your lordship , and of me as Rossmore , or the Earl , or his Lordship , and -- '' `` Oh , scat !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 10]: I ca n't ever do it , Berry . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 29]: `` But indeed you must , my love -- we must live up to our altered position and submit with what grace we may to its requirements . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 50]: `` Well , all right , have it your own way ; I 've never set my wishes against your commands yet , Mul -- my lord , and it 's late to begin now , though to my mind it 's the rottenest foolishness that ever was . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 8]: `` Spoken like my own true wife !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 9]: There , kiss and be friends again . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 5]: `` But -- Gwendolen !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 14]: I do n't know how I am ever going to stand that name .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 12]: Why , a body would n't know Sally Sellers in it .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 34]: It 's too large for her ; kind of like a cherub in an ulster , and it 's a most outlandish sort of a name , anyway , to my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 15]: `` You 'll not hear her find fault with it , my lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 7]: `` That 's a true word .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 15]: She takes to any kind of romantic rubbish like she was born to it .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 11]: She never got it from me , that 's sure .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 20]: And sending her to that silly college has n't helped the matter any -- just the other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 7]: `` Now hear her , Hawkins !
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 18]: Rowena-Ivanhoe College is the selectest and most aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies in our country .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 30]: Under no circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either very rich and fashionable or can prove four generations of what may be called American nobility .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 104]: Castellated college-buildings -- towers and turrets and an imitation moat -- and everything about the place named out of Sir Walter Scott 's books and redolent of royalty and state and style ; and all the richest girls keep phaetons , and coachmen in livery , and riding-horses , with English grooms in plug hats and tight-buttoned coats , and top-boots , and a whip-handle without any whip to it , to ride sixty-three feet behind them -- '' `` And they do n't learn a blessed thing , Washington Hawkins , not a single blessed thing but showy rubbish and un-american pretentiousness .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 39]: But send for the Lady Gwendolen -- do ; for I reckon the peerage regulations require that she must come home and let on to go into seclusion and mourn for those Arkansas blatherskites she 's lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 4]: `` My darling !
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 2]: Blatherskites ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 6]: Remember -- noblesse oblige . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 31]: `` There , there -- talk to me in your own tongue , Ross -- you do n't know any other , and you only botch it when you try .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 27]: Oh , do n't stare -- it was a slip , and no crime ; customs of a life-time ca n't be dropped in a second .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 19]: Rossmore -- there , now , be appeased , and go along with you and attend to Gwendolen .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 8]: Are you going to write , Washington ?
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 5]: -- or telegraph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 8]: `` He will telegraph , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 17]: `` I thought as much , '' my lady muttered , as she left the room .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 14]: `` Wants it so the address will have to appear on the envelop .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 10]: It will just make a fool of that child .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 25]: She 'll get it , of course , for if there are any other Sellerses there they 'll not be able to claim it .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 16]: And just leave her alone to show it around and make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 9]: Well , maybe she 's forgivable for that .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 38]: She 's so poor and they 're so rich , of course she 's had her share of snubs from the livery-flunkey sort , and I reckon it 's only human to want to get even . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 40]: Uncle Dan ' l was sent with the telegram ; for although a conspicuous object in a corner of the drawing-room was a telephone hanging on a transmitter , Washington found all attempts to raise the central office vain .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 53]: The Colonel grumbled something about its being `` always out of order when you 've got particular and especial use for it , '' but he did n't explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a dummy and had n't any wire attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 21]: And yet the Colonel often used it -- when visitors were present -- and seemed to get messages through it .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: Mourning paper and a seal were ordered , then the friends took a rest .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 40]: Next afternoon , while Hawkins , by request , draped Andrew Jackson 's portrait with crape , the rightful earl , wrote off the family bereavement to the usurper in England -- a letter which we have already read .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 43]: He also , by letter to the village authorities at Duffy 's Corners , Arkansas , gave order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by some St. Louis expert and shipped at once to the usurper -- with bill .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 106]: Then he drafted out the Rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of brown paper , and he and Hawkins took it to Hawkins 's Yankee furniture-mender and at the end of an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatchments , which they nailed up on the front of the house -- attractions calculated to draw , and they did ; for it was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood , with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to spare for a point of interest like that , and keep on sparing them for it , days and days together .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 97]: The new earl found -- without surprise -- this society item in the evening paper , and cut it out and scrapbooked it : By a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen , Colonel Mulberry Sellers , Perpetual Member-at-large of the Diplomatic Body , succeeds , as rightful lord , to the great earldom of Rossmore , third by order of precedence in the earldoms of Great Britain , and will take early measures , by suit in the House of Lords , to wrest the title and estates from the present usurping holder of them .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 20]: Until the season of mourning is past , the usual Thursday evening receptions at Rossmore Towers will be discontinued .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 9]: Lady Rossmore 's comment-to herself : `` Receptions !
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 29]: People who do n't rightly know him may think he is commonplace , but to my mind he is one of the most unusual men I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 18]: As for suddenness and capacity in imagining things , his beat do n't exist , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 29]: As like as not it would n't have occurred to anybody else to name this poor old rat-trap Rossmore Towers , but it just comes natural to him .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 27]: Well , no doubt it 's a blessed thing to have an imagination that can always make you satisfied , no matter how you are fixed .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 40]: Uncle Dave Hopkins used to always say , ` Turn me into John Calvin , and I want to know which place I 'm going to ; turn me into Mulberry Sellers and I do n't care . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 16]: The rightful earl 's comment-to himself : `` It 's a beautiful name , beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 13]: Pity I did n't think of it before I wrote the usurper .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: But I 'll be ready for him when he answers . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 12]: CHAPTER V. No answer to that telegram ; no arriving daughter .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 16]: Yet nobody showed any uneasiness or seemed surprised ; that is , nobody but Washington .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 17]: After three days of waiting , he asked Lady Rossmore what she supposed the trouble was .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 20]: She answered , tranquilly : `` Oh , it 's some notion of hers , you never can tell .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 43]: She 's a Sellers , all through -- at least in some of her ways ; and a Sellers ca n't tell you beforehand what he 's going to do , because he do n't know himself till he 's done it .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 12]: She 's all right ; no occasion to worry about her .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 25]: When she 's ready she 'll come or she 'll write , and you ca n't tell which , till it 's happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 8]: It turned out to be a letter .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 39]: It was handed in at that moment , and was received by the mother without trembling hands or feverish eagerness , or any other of the manifestations common in the case of long delayed answers to imperative telegrams .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 37]: She polished her glasses with tranquility and thoroughness , pleasantly gossiping along , the while , then opened the letter and began to read aloud : KENILWORTH KEEP , REDGAUNTLET HALL , ROWENA-IVANHOE COLLEGE , THURSDAY .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 12]: DEAR PRECIOUS MAMMA ROSSMORE : Oh , the joy of it !
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 6]: -- you ca n't think .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 31]: They had always turned up their noses at our pretentions , you know ; and I had fought back as well as I could by turning up mine at theirs .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 38]: They always said it might be something great and fine to be rightful Shadow of an earldom , but to merely be shadow of a shadow , and two or three times removed at that -- pooh-pooh !
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 33]: And I always retorted that not to be able to show four generations of American-Colonial-Dutch Peddler - and-Salt-Cod-McAllister-Nobility might be endurable , but to have to confess such an origin -- pfew-few !
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 11]: Well , the telegram , it was just a cyclone !
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 31]: The messenger came right into the great Rob Roy Hall of Audience , as excited as he could be , singing out , `` Dispatch for Lady Gwendolen Sellers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 18]: and you ought to have seen that simpering chattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats , turn to stone !
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 19]: I was off in the corner , of course , by myself -- it 's where Cinderella belongs .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 68]: I took the telegram and read it , and tried to faint -- and I could have done it if I had had any preparation , but it was all so sudden , you know -- but no matter , I did the next best thing : I put my handkerchief to my eyes and fled sobbing to my room , dropping the telegram as I started .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 34]: I released one corner of my eye a moment -- just enough to see the herd swarm for the telegram -- and then continued my broken-hearted flight just as happy as a bird .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 39]: Then the visits of condolence began , and I had to accept the loan of Miss Augusta-Templeton-Ashmore Hamilton 's quarters because the press was so great and there is n't room for three and a cat in mine .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 22]: And I 've been holding a Lodge of Sorrow ever since and defending myself against people 's attempts to claim kin .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 54]: And do you know , the very first girl to fetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that foolish Skimperton girl who has always snubbed me so shamefully and claimed lordship and precedence of the whole college because some ancestor of hers , some time or other , was a McAllister .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 21]: Why it was like the bottom bird in the menagerie putting on airs because its head ancestor was a pterodactyl .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 10]: But the ger-reatest triumph of all was -- guess .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 5]: But you 'll never .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 4]: This is it .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 25]: That little fool and two others have always been fussing and fretting over which was entitled to precedence -- by rank , you know .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 51]: They 've nearly starved themselves at it ; for each claimed the right to take precedence of all the college in leaving the table , and so neither of them ever finished her dinner , but broke off in the middle and tried to get out ahead of the others .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 37]: Well , after my first day 's grief and seclusion -- I was fixing up a mourning dress you see -- I appeared at the public table again , and then -- what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 52]: Those three fluffy goslings sat there contentedly , and squared up the long famine -- lapped and lapped , munched and munched , ate and ate , till the gravy appeared in their eyes -- humbly waiting for the Lady Gwendolen to take precedence and move out first , you see !
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 13]: Oh , yes , I 've been having a darling good time .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 25]: And do you know , not one of these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how I came by my new name .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 17]: With some , this is due to charity , but with the others it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 12]: They refrain , not from native kindness but from educated discretion .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 4]: I educated them .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 38]: Well , as soon as I shall have settled up what 's left of the old scores and snuffed up a few more of those pleasantly intoxicating clouds of incense , I shall pack and depart homeward .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: Tell papa I am as fond of him as I am of my new name .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 9]: I could n't put it stronger than that .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 6]: What an inspiration it was !
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 7]: But inspirations come easy to him .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 9]: These , from your loving daughter , GWENDOLEN .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 10]: Hawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 22]: `` Good hand , '' he said , `` and full of confidence and animation , and goes racing right along .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 9]: She 's bright -- that 's plain . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: `` Oh , they 're all bright -- the Sellerses .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 11]: Anyway , they would be , if there were any .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 19]: Even those poor Latherses would have been bright if they had been Sellerses ; I mean full blood .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 34]: Of course they had a Sellers strain in them -- a big strain of it , too -- but being a Bland dollar do n't make it a dollar just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 27]: The seventh day after the date of the telegram Washington came dreaming down to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 15]: Here was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his life .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 14]: It was Sally Sellers Lady Gwendolen ; she had come in the night .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 44]: And it seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest he had ever looked upon , and the most exquisitely contrived and fashioned and combined , as to decorative trimmings , and fixings , and melting harmonies of color .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 32]: It was only a morning dress , and inexpensive , but he confessed to himself , in the English common to Cherokee Strip , that it was a `` corker . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 66]: And now , as he perceived , the reason why the Sellers household poverties and sterilities had been made to blossom like the rose , and charm the eye and satisfy the spirit , stood explained ; here was the magician ; here in the midst of her works , and furnishing in her own person the proper accent and climaxing finish of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 32]: `` My daughter , Major Hawkins -- come home to mourn ; flown home at the call of affliction to help the authors of her being bear the burden of bereavement .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 30]: She was very fond of the late earl -- idolized him , sir , idolized him -- '' `` Why , father , I 've never seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 27]: `` True -- she 's right , I was thinking of another -- er -- of her mother -- '' `` I idolized that smoked haddock ?
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 14]: -- that sentimental , spiritless -- '' `` I was thinking of myself !
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 15]: Poor noble fellow , we were inseparable com -- '' `` Hear the man !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 107]: Mulberry Sel -- Mul -- Rossmore -- hang the troublesome name I can never -- if I 've heard you say once , I 've heard you say a thousand times that if that poor sheep -- '' `` I was thinking of -- of -- I do n't know who I was thinking of , and it does n't make any difference anyway ; somebody idolized him , I recollect it as if it were yesterday ; and -- '' `` Father , I am going to shake hands with Major Hawkins , and let the introduction work along and catch up at its leisure .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 67]: I remember you very well in deed , Major Hawkins , although I was a little child when I saw you last ; and I am very , very glad indeed to see you again and have you in our house as one of us ; '' and beaming in his face she finished her cordial shake with the hope that he had not forgotten her .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 107]: He was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken heartiness , and wanted to repay her by assuring her that he remembered her , and not only that but better even than he remembered his own children , but the facts would not quite warrant this ; still , he stumbled through a tangled sentence which answered just as well , since the purport of it was an awkward and unintentional confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupefied him that he had n't got back to his bearings , yet , and therefore could n't be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 14]: The speech made him her friend ; it could n't well help it .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 28]: In truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type , and may well excuse a moment of our time spent in its consideration .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 28]: It did not consist in the fact that she had eyes , nose , mouth , chin , hair , ears , it consisted in their arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 20]: In true beauty , more depends upon right location and judicious distribution of feature than upon multiplicity of them .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 6]: So also as regards color .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 23]: The very combination of colors which in a volcanic irruption would add beauty to a landscape might detach it from a girl .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 5]: Such was Gwendolen Sellers .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 43]: The family circle being completed by Gwendolen 's arrival , it was decreed that the official mourning should now begin ; that it should begin at six o'clock every evening , -LRB- the dinner hour , -RRB- and end with the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 32]: `` It 's a grand old line , major , a sublime old line , and deserves to be mourned for , almost royally ; almost imperially , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 46]: Er -- Lady Gwendolen -- but she 's gone ; never mind ; I wanted my Peerage ; I 'll fetch it myself , presently , and show you a thing or two that will give you a realizing idea of what our house is .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 31]: I 've been glancing through Burke , and I find that of William the Conqueror 's sixty-four natural ah -- my dear , would you mind getting me that book ?
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 9]: It 's on the escritoire in our boudoir .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 36]: Yes , as I was saying , there 's only St. Albans , Buccleugh and Grafton ahead of us on the list -- all the rest of the British nobility are in procession behind us .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 7]: Ah , thanks , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 16]: Now then , we turn to William , and we find -- letter for XYZ ?
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: Oh , splendid -- when 'd you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 67]: `` Last night ; but I was asleep before you came , you were out so late ; and when I came to breakfast Miss Gwendolen -- well , she knocked everything out of me , you know -- '' `` Wonderful girl , wonderful ; her great origin is detectable in her step , her carriage , her features -- but what does he say ?
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: Come , this is exciting . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 20]: `` I have n't read it -- er -- Rossm -- Mr. Rossm -- er -- '' `` M'lord !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 7]: Just cut it short like that .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 6]: It 's the English way .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: I 'll open it .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 8]: Ah , now let 's see . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 6]: A. TO YOU KNOW WHO .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 5]: Think I know you .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 4]: Wait ten days .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 4]: Coming to Washington .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 10]: The excitement died out of both men 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 32]: There was a brooding silence for a while , then the younger one said with a sigh : `` Why , we ca n't wait ten days for the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 20]: `` No -- the man 's unreasonable ; we are down to the bed rock , financially speaking . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 100]: `` If we could explain to him in some way , that we are so situated that time is of the utmost importance to us -- '' `` Yes -- yes , that 's it -- and so if it would be as convenient for him to come at once it would be a great accommodation to us , and one which we -- which we -- which we -- wh -- well , which we should sincerely appreciate -- '' `` That 's it -- and most gladly reciprocate -- '' `` Certainly -- that 'll fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 32]: Worded right , if he 's a man -- got any of the feelings of a man , sympathies and all that , he 'll be here inside of twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 14]: Pen and paper -- come , we 'll get right at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 13]: Between them they framed twenty-two different advertisements , but none was satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 10]: A main fault in all of them was urgency .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 30]: That feature was very troublesome : if made prominent , it was calculated to excite Pete 's suspicion ; if modified below the suspicion-point it was flat and meaningless .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 44]: Finally the Colonel resigned , and said : `` I have noticed , in such literary experiences as I have had , that one of the most taking things to do is to conceal your meaning when you are trying to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 34]: Whereas , if you go at literature with a free conscience and nothing to conceal , you can turn out a book , every time , that the very elect ca n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 5]: They all do . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 23]: Then Hawkins resigned also , and the two agreed that they must manage to wait the ten days some how or other .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 64]: Next , they caught a ray of cheer : since they had something definite to go upon , now , they could probably borrow money on the reward -- enough , at any rate , to tide them over till they got it ; and meantime the materializing recipe would be perfected , and then good bye to trouble for good and all .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: The next day , May the tenth , a couple of things happened -- among others .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 67]: The remains of the noble Arkansas twins left our shores for England , consigned to Lord Rossmore , and Lord Rossmore 's son , Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley , sailed from Liverpool for America to place the reversion of the earldom in the hands of the rightful peer , Mulberry Sellers , of Rossmore Towers in the District of Columbia , U. S. A .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 20]: These two impressive shipments would meet and part in mid-Atlantic , five days later , and give no sign .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 16]: In the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their great kinsman .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 25]: To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit nothing , the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 53]: However when he had worn himself out and got quiet again , he looked the matter over and decided that the twins had some moral rights , although they had no legal ones ; they were of his blood , and it could not be decorous to treat them as common clay .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 31]: So he laid them with their majestic kin in the Cholmondeley church , with imposing state and ceremony , and added the supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 8]: But he drew the line at hatchments .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 28]: Our friends in Washington watched the weary days go by , while they waited for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his calamitous procrastinations .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 42]: Meantime , Sally Sellers , who was as practical and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and aristocratic , was leading a life of intense interest and activity and getting the most she could out of her double personality .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 31]: All day long in the privacy of her work-room , Sally Sellers earned bread for the Sellers family ; and all the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported the Rossmore dignity .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 42]: All day she was American , practically , and proud of the work of her head and hands and its commercial result ; all the evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadow-land peopled with titled and coroneted fictions .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 31]: By day , to her , the place was a plain , unaffected , ramshackle old trap just that , and nothing more ; by night it was Rossmore Towers .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 11]: At college she had learned a trade without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 15]: The girls had found out that she was the designer of her own gowns .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 45]: She had no idle moments after that , and wanted none ; for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life , and it was manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter of costume-designing .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 55]: Within three days after reaching home she had hunted up some work ; before Pete was yet due in Washington , and before the twins were fairly asleep in English soil , she was already nearly swamped with work , and the sacrificing of the family chromos for debt had got an effective check .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 83]: `` She 's a brick , '' said Rossmore to the Major ; `` just her father all over : prompt to labor with head or hands , and not ashamed of it ; capable , always capable , let the enterprise be what it may ; successful by nature -- do n't know what defeat is ; thus , intensely and practically American by inhaled nationalism , and at the same time intensely and aristocratically European by inherited nobility of blood .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 23]: Just me , exactly : Mulberry Sellers in matter of finance and invention ; after office hours , what do you find ?
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 12]: The same clothes , yes , but what 's in them ?
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 6]: Rossmore of the peerage . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: The two friends had haunted the general post-office daily .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 7]: At last they had their reward .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 14]: Toward evening the 20th of May , they got a letter for XYZ .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 13]: It bore the Washington postmark ; the note itself was not dated .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 14]: It said : `` Ash barrel back of lamp post Black horse Alley .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 24]: If you are playing square go and set on it to-morrow morning 21st 10.22 not sooner not later wait till I come . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 8]: The friends cogitated over the note profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 22]: Presently the earl said : `` Do n't you reckon he 's afraid we are a sheriff with a requisition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 8]: `` Why , m ` lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: `` Because that 's no place for a seance .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 8]: Nothing friendly , nothing sociable about it .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 58]: And at the same time , a body that wanted to know who was roosting on that ash-barrel without exposing himself by going near it , or seeming to be interested in it , could just stand on the street corner and take a glance down the alley and satisfy himself , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 10]: `` Yes , his idea is plain , now .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 14]: He seems to be a man that ca n't be candid and straightforward .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 34]: He acts as if he thought we -- shucks , I wish he had come out like a man and told us what hotel he -- '' `` Now you 've struck it !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 14]: you 've struck it sure , Washington ; he has told us . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 5]: `` Has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 13]: `` Yes , he has ; but he did n't mean to .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 17]: That alley is a lonesome little pocket that runs along one side of the New Gadsby .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 6]: That 's his hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 9]: `` What makes ' you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 8]: `` Why , I just know it .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 14]: He 's got a room that 's just across from that lamp post .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 64]: He 's going to sit there perfectly comfortable behind his shutters at 10.22 to-morrow , and when he sees us sitting on the ash-barrel , he 'll say to himself , ' I saw one of those fellows on the train ' -- and then he 'll pack his satchel in half a minute and ship for the ends of the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 27]: Hawkins turned sick with disappointment : `` Oh , dear , it 's all up , Colonel -- it 's exactly what he 'll do . ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 7]: `` Indeed he wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 5]: `` Wo n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 17]: `` Because you wo n't be holding the ash barrel down , it 'll be me .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 36]: You 'll be coming in with an officer and a requisition in plain clothes -- the officer , I mean -- the minute you see him arrive and open up a talk with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 13]: `` Well , what a head you have got , Colonel Sellers !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 12]: I never should have thought of that in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 36]: `` Neither would any earl of Rossmore , betwixt William 's contribution and Mulberry -- as earl ; but it 's office hours , now , you see , and the earl in me sleeps .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 11]: Come -- I 'll show you his very room . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 24]: They reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby about nine in the evening , and passed down the alley to the lamp post .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 28]: `` There you are , '' said the colonel , triumphantly , with a wave of his hand which took in the whole side of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 12]: `` There it is -- what did I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 15]: `` Well , but -- why , Colonel , it 's six stories high .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 20]: I do n't quite make out which window you -- '' `` All the windows , all of them .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 17]: Let him have his choice -- I 'm indifferent , now that I have located him .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 17]: You go and stand on the corner and wait ; I 'll prospect the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 24]: The earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby , and finally took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 55]: During an hour crowds went up and crowds came down ; and all complete as to limbs ; but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was satisfactory -- got a glimpse of the back of it , though he had missed his chance at the face through waning alertness .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 28]: The glimpse revealed a cowboy hat , and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern , and an empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 21]: Then the elevator snatched the vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement , and rejoined the fellow-conspirator .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 12]: `` We 've got him , Major -- got him sure !
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 30]: I 've seen him -- seen him good ; and I do n't care where or when that man approaches me backwards , I 'll recognize him every time .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 5]: We 're all right .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 6]: Now for the requisition . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 12]: They got it , after the delays usual in such cases .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 25]: By half past eleven they were at home and happy , and went to bed full of dreams of the morrow 's great promise .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 31]: Among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow-passenger was a young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers , but Mulberry was not aware of it and did n't see him .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 5]: It was Viscount Berkeley .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 35]: Arrived in his room Lord Berkeley made preparations for that first and last and all-the-time duty of the visiting Englishman -- the jotting down in his diary of his `` impressions '' to date .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 13]: His preparations consisted in ransacking his `` box '' for a pen .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 20]: There was a plenty of steel pens on his table with the ink bottle , but he was English .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 19]: The English people manufacture steel pens for nineteen-twentieths of the globe , but they never use any themselves .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 7]: They use exclusively the pre-historic quill .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 60]: My lord not only found a quill pen , but the best one he had seen in several years -- and after writing diligently for some time , closed with the following entry : BUT IN ONE THING I HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE , I OUGHT TO HAVE SHUCKED MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 56]: He sat admiring that pen a while , and then went on : `` All attempts to mingle with the common people and became permanently one of them are going to fail , unless I can get rid of it , disappear from it , and re-appear with the solid protection of a new name .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 33]: I am astonished and pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are to get acquainted with a lord , and how diligent they are in pushing attentions upon him .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 18]: They lack English servility , it is true -- but they could acquire it , with practice .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 12]: My quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious way .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 40]: I write my family name without additions , on the register of this hotel , and imagine that I am going to pass for an obscure and unknown wanderer , but the clerk promptly calls out , ` Front !
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 7]: show his lordship to four-eighty-two ! '
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 21]: and before I can get to the lift there is a reporter trying to interview me as they call it .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 9]: This sort of thing shall cease at once .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 32]: I will hunt up the American Claimant the first thing in the morning , accomplish my mission , then change my lodging and vanish from scrutiny under a fictitious name . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 38]: He left his diary on the table , where it would be handy in case any new `` impressions '' should wake him up in the night , then he went to bed and presently fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 58]: An hour or two passed , and then he came slowly to consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds hammering at the gates of his brain for admission ; the next moment he was sharply awake , and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and boom of an undammed freshet into his ears .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 54]: Banging and slamming of shutters ; smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass ; clatter of flying feet along the halls ; shrieks , supplications , dumb moanings of despair , within , hoarse shouts of command outside ; cracklings and mappings , and the windy roar of victorious flames !
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 6]: Bang , bang , bang !
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 19]: on the door , and a cry : `` Turn out -- the house is on fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 9]: The cry passed on , and the banging .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 33]: Lord Berkeley sprang out of bed and moved with all possible speed toward the clothes-press in the darkness and the gathering smoke , but fell over a chair and lost his bearings .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 37]: He groped desperately about on his hands , and presently struck his head against the table and was deeply grateful , for it gave him his bearings again , since it stood close by the door .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 19]: He seized his most precious possession ; his journaled Impressions of America , and darted from the room .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 20]: He ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew indicated the place of a fire-escape .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 10]: The door of the room beside it was open .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 19]: In the room the gas was burning full head ; on a chair was a pile of clothing .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 51]: He ran to the window , could not get it up , but smashed it with a chair , and stepped out on the landing of the fire-escape ; below him was a crowd of men , with a sprinkling of women and youth , massed in a ruddy light .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 10]: Must he go down in his spectral night dress ?
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 25]: No -- this side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end ; he would snatch on those clothes .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 4]: Which he did .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 21]: They fitted well enough , though a trifle loosely , and they were just a shade loud as to pattern .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 23]: Also as to hat -- which was of a new breed to him , Buffalo Bill not having been to England yet .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 27]: One side of the coat went on , but the other side refused ; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 26]: He started down without waiting to get it loose , made the trip successfully , and was promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the police .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 44]: The cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre of attraction for comfort , although nothing could be more profoundly respectful , not to say deferential , than was the manner of the crowd toward him .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 45]: In his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry in his diary : `` It is of no use ; they know a lord through any disguise , and show awe of him -- even something very like fear , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 15]: Presently one of the gaping and adoring half-circle of boys ventured a timid question .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 5]: My lord answered it .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 18]: The boys glanced wonderingly at each other and from somewhere fell the comment : `` English cowboy !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: Well , if that ai n't curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 13]: Another mental note to be preserved for the diary : `` Cowboy .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 7]: Now what might a cowboy be ?
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 46]: Perhaps -- '' But the viscount perceived that some more questions were about to be asked ; so he worked his way out of the crowd , released the sleeve , put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble and obscure lodging .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 12]: He found it and went to bed and was soon asleep .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: In the morning , he examined his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 21]: They were rather assertive , it seemed to him , but they were new and clean , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: There was considerable property in the pockets .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 7]: Item , five one-hundred dollar bills .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 11]: Item , near fifty dollars in small bills and silver .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 4]: Plug of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: Hymn-book , which refuses to open ; found to contain whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 6]: Memorandum book bearing no name .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 41]: Scattering entries in it , recording in a sprawling , ignorant hand , appointments , bets , horse-trades , and so on , with people of strange , hyphenated name -- Six-Fingered Jake , Young-Man-afraid-of his-Shadow , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 6]: No letters , no documents .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 10]: The young man muses -- maps out his course .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 41]: His letter of credit is burned ; he will borrow the small bills and the silver in these pockets , apply part of it to advertising for the owner , and use the rest for sustenance while he seeks work .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 18]: He sends out for the morning paper , next , and proceeds to read about the fire .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 11]: The biggest line in the display-head announces his own death !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 108]: The body of the account furnishes all the particulars ; and tells how , with the inherited heroism of his caste , he went on saving women and children until escape for himself was impossible ; then with the eyes of weeping multitudes upon him , he stood with folded arms and sternly awaited the approach of the devouring fiend ; `` and so standing , amid a tossing sea of flame and on-rushing billows of smoke , the noble young heir of the great house of Rossmore was caught up in a whirlwind of fiery glory , and disappeared forever from the vision of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 18]: The thing was so fine and generous and knightly that it brought the moisture to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 18]: Presently he said to himself : `` What to do is as plain as day , now .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 11]: My Lord Berkeley is dead -- let him stay so .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 16]: Died creditably , too ; that will make the calamity the easier for my father .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 14]: And I do n't have to report to the American Claimant , now .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 14]: Yes , nothing could be better than the way matters have turned out .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 21]: I have only to furnish myself with a new name , and take my new start in life totally untrammeled .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 20]: Now I breathe my first breath of real freedom ; and how fresh and breezy and inspiring it is !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 7]: At last I am a man !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 39]: a man on equal terms with my neighbor ; and by my manhood ; and by it alone , I shall rise and be seen of the world , or I shall sink from sight and deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 21]: This is the gladdest day , and the proudest , that ever poured it 's sun upon my head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 9]: `` GOD bless my soul , Hawkins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: The morning paper dropped from the Colonel 's nerveless-grasp .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 5]: `` He 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 19]: -- the bright , the young , the gifted , the noblest of his illustrious race -- gone !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 9]: gone up in flames and unimaginable glory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 23]: `` My precious , precious young kinsman -- Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley , son and heir of usurping Rossmore . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 9]: `` It 's true -- too true . ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 5]: `` Last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 19]: `` Right here in Washington ; where he arrived from England last night , the papers say . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: `` You do n't say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 6]: `` Hotel burned down . ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 5]: `` What hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 6]: `` The New Gadsby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 6]: `` Oh , my goodness !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 9]: And have we lost both of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 5]: `` Both who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 5]: `` One-Arm Pete . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 12]: `` Oh , great guns , I forgot all about him .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 7]: Oh , I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 3]: `` Hope !
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 6]: Well , I should say !
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 8]: Oh , we ca n't spare him !
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 17]: We can better afford to lose a million viscounts than our only support and stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 72]: They searched the paper diligently , and were appalled to find that a one-armed man had been seen flying along one of the halls of the hotel in his underclothing and apparently out of his head with fright , and as he would listen to no one and persisted in making for a stairway which would carry him to certain death , his case was given over as a hopeless one .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 16]: `` Poor fellow , '' sighed Hawkins ; `` and he had friends so near .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 18]: I wish we had n't come away from there -- maybe we could have saved him . ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 16]: The earl looked up and said calmly : `` His being dead does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 5]: He was uncertain before .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 10]: We 've got him sure , this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 4]: `` Got him ?
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 3]: How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 7]: `` I will materialize him . ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 12]: `` Rossmore , do n't -- do n't trifle with me .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 5]: Do you mean that ?
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: Can you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 15]: `` I can do it , just as sure as you are sitting there .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 5]: And I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 16]: `` Give me your hand , and let me have the comfort of shaking it .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 13]: I was perishing , and you have put new life into me .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 13]: Get at it , oh , get at it right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 25]: `` It will take a little time , Hawkins , but there 's no hurry , none in the world -- in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 18]: And of course certain duties have devolved upon me now , which necessarily claim my first attention .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 27]: This poor young nobleman -- '' `` Why , yes , I am sorry for my heartlessness , and you smitten with this new family affliction .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 14]: Of course you must materialize him first -- I quite understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 25]: `` I -- I -- well , I was n't meaning just that , but , -- why , what am I thinking of !
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: Of course I must materialize him .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 30]: Oh , Hawkins , selfishness is the bottom trait in human nature ; I was only thinking that now , with the usurper 's heir out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 12]: But you 'll forgive that momentary weakness , and forget it .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 23]: Do n't ever remember it against me that Mulberry Sellers was once mean enough to think the thought that I was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 50]: I 'll materialise him -- I will , on my honor -- and I 'd do it were he a thousand heirs jammed into one and stretching in a solid rank from here to the stolen estates of Rossmore , and barring the road forever to the rightful earl !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 18]: `` There spoke the real Sellers -- the other had a false ring , old friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 33]: `` Hawkins , my boy , it just occurs to me -- a thing I keep forgetting to mention -- a matter that we 've got to be mighty careful about . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 10]: `` We must keep absolutely still about these materializations .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 14]: Mind , not a hint of them must escape -- not a hint .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 32]: To say nothing of how my wife and daughter -- high-strung , sensitive organizations -- might feel about them , the negroes would n't stay on the place a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: `` That 's true , they would n't .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 22]: It 's well you spoke , for I 'm not naturally discreet with my tongue when I 'm not warned . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 176]: Sellers reached out and touched a bell-button in the wall ; set his eye upon the rear door and waited ; touched it again and waited ; and just as Hawkins was remarking admiringly that the Colonel was the most progressive and most alert man he had ever seen , in the matter of impressing into his service every modern convenience the moment it was invented , and always keeping breast to breast with the drum major in the great work of material civilization , he forsook the button -LRB- which had n't any wire attached to it , -RRB- rang a vast dinner bell which stood on the table , and remarked that he had tried that new-fangled dry battery , now , to his entire satisfaction , and had got enough of it ; and added : `` Nothing would do Graham Bell but I must try it ; said the mere fact of my trying it would secure public confidence , and get it a chance to show what it could do .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 27]: I told him that in theory a dry battery was just a curled darling and no mistake , but when it come to practice , sho !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 7]: -- and here 's the result .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 4]: Was I right ?
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 8]: What should you say , Washington Hawkins ?
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 9]: You 've seen me try that button twice .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 4]: Was I right ?
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 6]: -- that 's the idea .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 15]: Did I know what I was talking about , or did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 19]: `` Well , you know how I feel about you , Colonel Sellers , and always have felt .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 12]: It seems to me that you always know everything about everything .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 30]: If that man had known you as I know you he would have taken your judgment at the start , and dropped his dry battery where it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: `` Did you ring , Marse Sellers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 9]: `` No , Marse Sellers did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 9]: `` Den it was you , Marse Washington .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: I 's heah , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 12]: `` No , it was n't Marse Washington , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 6]: `` De good lan ' !
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 8]: who did ring her , den ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: `` Lord Rossmore rang it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 25]: The old negro flung up his hands and exclaimed : `` Blame my skin if I hai n't gone en forgit dat name agin !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 11]: Come heah , Jinny -- run heah , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 3]: Jinny arrived .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 26]: `` You take dish-yer order de lord gwine to give you I 's gwine down suller and study dat name tell I git it . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 6]: `` I take de order !
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 9]: Who 's yo ' nigger las ' year ?
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: De bell rung for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 8]: `` Dat do n't make no diffunce .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 27]: When a bell ring for anybody , en old marster tell me to -- '' `` Clear out , and settle it in the kitchen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 42]: The noise of the quarreling presently sank to a murmur in the distance , and the earl added : `` That 's a trouble with old house servants that were your slaves once and have been your personal friends always . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 10]: `` Yes , and members of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 20]: `` Members of the family is just what they become -- THE members of the family , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 9]: And sometimes master and mistress of the household .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 47]: These two are mighty good and loving and faithful and honest , but hang it , they do just about as they please , they chip into a conversation whenever they want to , and the plain fact is , they ought to be killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 22]: It was a random remark , but it gave him an idea -- however , nothing could happen without that result .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 21]: `` What I wanted , Hawkins , was to send for the family and break the news to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 12]: `` O , never mind bothering with the servants , then .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 9]: I will go and bring them down . ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 11]: While he was gone , the earl worked his idea .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 39]: `` Yes , '' he said to himself , `` when I 've got the materializing down to a certainty , I will get Hawkins to kill them , and after that they will be under better control .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 15]: Without doubt a materialized negro could easily be hypnotized into a state resembling silence .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 38]: And this could be made permanent -- yes , and also modifiable , at will -- sometimes very silent , sometimes turn on more talk , more action , more emotion , according to what you want .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 7]: It 's a prime good idea .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 11]: Make it adjustable -- with a screw or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 49]: The two ladies entered , now , with Hawkins , and the two negroes followed , uninvited , and fell to brushing and dusting around , for they perceived that there was matter of interest to the fore , and were willing to find out what it was .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 70]: Sellers broke the news with stateliness and ceremony , first warning the ladies , with gentle art , that a pang of peculiar sharpness was about to be inflicted upon their hearts -- hearts still sore from a like hurt , still lamenting a like loss -- then he took the paper , and with trembling lips and with tears in his voice he gave them that heroic death-picture .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 16]: The result was a very genuine outbreak of sorrow and sympathy from all the hearers .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 57]: The elder lady cried , thinking how proud that great-hearted young hero 's mother would be , if she were living , and how unappeasable her grief ; and the two old servants cried with her , and spoke out their applauses and their pitying lamentations with the eloquent sincerity and simplicity native to their race .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 16]: Gwendolen was touched , and the romantic side of her nature was strongly wrought upon .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 33]: She said that such a nature as that young man 's was rarely and truly noble , and nearly perfect ; and that with nobility of birth added it was entirely perfect .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 22]: For such a man she could endure all things , suffer all things , even to the sacrificing of her life .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 39]: She wished she could have seen him ; the slightest , the most momentary , contact with such a spirit would have ennobled her own character and made ignoble thoughts and ignoble acts thereafter impossible to her forever .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 10]: `` Have they found the body , Rossmore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 4]: asked the wife .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 11]: `` Yes , that is , they 've found several .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 15]: It must be one of them , but none of them are recognizable . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 9]: `` What are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 21]: `` I am going down there and identify one of them and send it home to the stricken father . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 13]: `` But papa , did you ever see the young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 6]: `` No , Gwendolen-why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 8]: `` How will you identify it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 15]: `` I -- well , you know it says none of them are recognizable .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 16]: I 'll send his father one of them -- there 's probably no choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 43]: Gwendolen knew it was not worth while to argue the matter further , since her father 's mind was made up and there was a chance for him to appear upon that sad scene down yonder in an authentic and official way .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 13]: So she said no more -- till he asked for a basket .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 6]: `` A basket , papa ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 4]: What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 7]: `` It might be ashes . ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 15]: The earl and Washington started on the sorrowful errand , talking as they walked .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 6]: `` And as usual ! ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 6]: `` What , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 8]: `` Seven of them in that hotel .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 2]: Actresses .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 9]: And all burnt out , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 8]: `` Any of them burnt up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 31]: `` Oh , no they escaped ; they always do ; but there 's never a one of them that knows enough to fetch out her jewelry with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: `` That 's strange . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 13]: `` Strange -- it 's the most unaccountable thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 18]: Experience teaches them nothing ; they ca n't seem to learn anything except out of a book .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 11]: In some uses there 's manifestly a fatality about it .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 18]: For instance , take What 's - her-name , that plays those sensational thunder and lightning parts .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 25]: She 's got a perfectly immense reputation -- draws like a dog-fight -- and it all came from getting burnt out in hotels . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 15]: `` Why , how could that give her a reputation as an actress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 12]: `` It did n't -- it only made her name familiar .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 28]: People want to see her play because her name is familiar , but they do n't know what made it familiar , because they do n't remember .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 26]: First , she was at the bottom of the ladder , and absolutely obscure wages thirteen dollars a week and find her own pads . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 4]: `` Pads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 18]: `` Yes -- things to fat up her spindles with so as to be plump and attractive .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 18]: Well , she got burnt out in a hotel and lost $ 30,000 worth of diamonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 3]: `` She ?
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 7]: Where 'd she get them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 24]: `` Goodness knows -- given to her , no doubt , by spoony young flats and sappy old bald-heads in the front row .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 8]: All the papers were full of it .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 9]: She struck for higher pay and got it .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 26]: Well , she got burnt out again and lost all her diamonds , and it gave her such a lift that she went starring . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 34]: `` Well , if hotel fires are all she 's got to depend on to keep up her name , it 's a pretty precarious kind of a reputation I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 5]: `` Not with her .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: No , anything but that .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 12]: Because she 's so lucky ; born lucky , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 12]: Every time there 's a hotel fire she 's in it .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 18]: She 's always there -- and if she ca n't be there herself , her diamonds are .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 15]: Now you ca n't make anything out of that but just sheer luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 9]: `` I never heard of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: She must have lost quarts of diamonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 10]: `` Quarts , she 's lost bushels of them .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 12]: It 's got so that the hotels are superstitious about her .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 7]: They wo n't let her in .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 20]: They think there will be a fire ; and besides , if she 's there it cancels the insurance .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: She 's been waning a little lately , but this fire will set her up .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 9]: She lost $ 60,000 worth last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 8]: `` I think she 's a fool .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 18]: If I had $ 60,000 worth of diamonds I would n't trust them in a hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 15]: `` I would n't either ; but you ca n't teach an actress that .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: This one 's been burnt out thirty-five times .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 24]: And yet if there 's a hotel fire in San Francisco to-night she 's got to bleed again , you mark my words .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 17]: Perfect ass ; they say she 's got diamonds in every hotel in the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 30]: When they arrived at the scene of the fire the poor old earl took one glimpse at the melancholy morgue and turned away his face overcome by the spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 28]: He said : `` It is too true , Hawkins -- recognition is impossible , not one of the five could be identified by its nearest friend .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 12]: You make the selection , I ca n't bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 16]: `` Which one had I better -- '' `` Oh , take any of them .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 7]: Pick out the best one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 45]: However , the officers assured the earl -- for they knew him , everybody in Washington knew him -- that the position in which these bodies were found made it impossible that any one of them could be that of his noble young kinsman .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 84]: They pointed out the spot where , if the newspaper account was correct , he must have sunk down to destruction ; and at a wide distance from this spot they showed him where the young man must have gone down in case he was suffocated in his room ; and they showed him still a third place , quite remote , where he might possibly have found his death if perchance he tried to escape by the side exit toward the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 25]: The old Colonel brushed away a tear and said to Hawkins : `` As it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 9]: Yes , it 's a matter of ashes .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 15]: Will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple more baskets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 65]: Reverently they got a basket of ashes from each of those now hallowed spots , and carried them home to consult as to the best manner of forwarding them to England , and also to give them an opportunity to `` lie in state , '' -- a mark of respect which the colonel deemed obligatory , considering the high rank of the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 56]: They set the baskets on the table in what was formerly the library , drawing-room and workshop -- now the Hall of Audience -- and went up stairs to the lumber room to see if they could find a British flag to use as a part of the outfit proper to the lying in state .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 27]: A moment later , Lady Rossmore came in from the street and caught sight of the baskets just as old Jinny crossed her field of vision .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 17]: She quite lost her patience and said : `` Well , what will you do next ?
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 19]: What in the world possessed you to clutter up the parlor table with these baskets of ashes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 4]: `` Ashes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 6]: And she came to look .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 9]: She put up her hands in pathetic astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 10]: `` Well , I never see de like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 8]: `` Did n't you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 5]: `` Who , me ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 18]: Clah to goodness it 's de fust time I 've sot eyes on 'em , Miss Polly .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 15]: Dat 's Dan ` l. Dat ole moke is losin ' his mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 17]: But it was n't Dan ` l , for he was called , and denied it .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: `` Dey ai n't no way to ` splain dat .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 23]: Wen hit 's one er dese-yer common ` currences , a body kin reckon maybe de cat -- '' `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 10]: and a shudder shook Lady Rossmore to her foundations .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 6]: `` I see it all .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 10]: Keep away from them -- they 're his . ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 8]: `` His , m ' lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 15]: `` Yes -- your young Marse Sellers from England that 's burnt up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 16]: She was alone with the ashes -- alone before she could take half a breath .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 58]: Then she went after Mulberry Sellers , purposing to make short work with his program , whatever it might be ; `` for , '' said she , `` when his sentimentals are up , he 's a numskull , and there 's no knowing what extravagance he 'll contrive , if you let him alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 4]: She found him .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 10]: He had found the flag and was bringing it .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 30]: When she heard that his idea was to have the remains `` lie in state , and invite the government and the public , '' she broke it up .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 61]: She said : `` Your intentions are all right -- they always are -- you want to do honour to the remains , and surely nobody can find any fault with that , for he was your kin ; but you are going the wrong way about it , and you will see it yourself if you stop and think .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 41]: You ca n't file around a basket of ashes trying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really solemn , because the solemner it is , the more it is n't -- anybody can see that .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 17]: It would be so with one basket ; it would be three times so with three .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 34]: Well , it stands to reason that if it would n't be solemn with one mourner , it would n't be with a procession -- and there would be five thousand people here .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 17]: I do n't know but it would be pretty near ridiculous ; I think it would .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 17]: No , Mulberry , they ca n't lie in state -- it would be a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 10]: Give that up and think of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 24]: So he gave it up ; and not reluctantly , when he had thought it over and realized how right her instinct was .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 14]: He concluded to merely sit up with the remains just himself and Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 57]: Even this seemed a doubtful attention , to his wife , but she offered no objection , for it was plain that he had a quite honest and simple-hearted desire to do the friendly and honourable thing by these forlorn poor relics which could command no hospitality in this far off land of strangers but his .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 39]: He draped the flag about the baskets , put some crape on the door-knob , and said with satisfaction : `` There -- he is as comfortable , now , as we can make him in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 29]: Except -- yes , we must strain a point there -- one must do as one would wish to be done by -- he must have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 7]: `` Have what , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 4]: `` Hatchment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 42]: The wife felt that the house-front was standing about all it could well stand , in that way ; the prospect of another stunning decoration of that nature distressed her , and she wished the thing had not occurred to him .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 54]: She said , hesitatingly : `` But I thought such an honour as that was n't allowed to any but very very near relations , who -- '' `` Right , you are quite right , my lady , perfectly right ; but there are n't any nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 17]: We can not avoid it ; we are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 64]: The hatchments were unnecessarily generous , each being as large as a blanket , and they were unnecessarily volcanic , too , as to variety and violence of color , but they pleased the earl 's barbaric eye , and they satisfied his taste for symmetry and completeness , too , for they left no waste room to speak of on the house-front .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 29]: Lady Rossmore and her daughter assisted at the sitting-up till near midnight , and helped the gentlemen to consider what ought to be done next with the remains .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 18]: Rossmore thought they ought to be sent home with a committee and resolutions , -- at once .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 6]: But the wife was doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 13]: She said : `` Would you send all of the baskets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: `` All at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 5]: `` To his father ?
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 8]: Oh , no -- by no means .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 5]: Think of the shock .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 15]: No -- one at a time ; break it to him by degrees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 10]: `` Would that have that effect , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 6]: `` Yes , my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 13]: Remember , you are young and elastic , but he is old .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 16]: To send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 29]: But mitigated -- one basket at a time , with restful intervals between , he would be used to it by the time he got all of him .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 10]: And sending him in three ships is safer anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 8]: On account of wrecks and storms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 10]: `` I do n't like the idea , father .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 40]: If I were his father it would be dreadful to have him coming in that -- in that -- '' `` On the installment plan , '' suggested Hawkins , gravely , and proud of being able to help .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 13]: `` Yes -- dreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 13]: There would be the strain of suspense upon me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 54]: To have so depressing a thing as a funeral impending , delayed , waiting , unaccomplished -- '' `` Oh , no , my child , '' said the earl reassuringly , `` there would be nothing of that kind ; so old a gentleman could not endure a long-drawn suspense like that .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 7]: There will be three funerals . ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 21]: Lady Rossmore looked up surprised , and said : `` How is that going to make it easier for him ?
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 10]: It 's a total mistake , to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 16]: He ought to be buried all at once ; I 'm sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: `` I should think so , too , '' said Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 11]: `` And certainly I should , '' said the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: `` You are all wrong , '' said the earl .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 11]: `` You will see it yourselves , if you think .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 12]: Only one of these baskets has got him in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 23]: `` Very well , then , '' said Lady Rossmore , `` the thing is perfectly simple -- bury that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 8]: `` Certainly , '' said Lady Gwendolen .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 24]: `` But it is not simple , '' said the earl , `` because we do not know which basket he is in .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 17]: We know he is in one of them , but that is all we do know .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: You see now , I reckon , that I was right ; it takes three funerals , there is no other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 12]: `` And three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 4]: asked the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 10]: `` Well -- yes -- to do it right .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 8]: That is what I should do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: `` It could not be done so , father .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 34]: Each of the inscriptions would give the same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of these monuments , and that would not answer at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 8]: The earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 13]: `` No , '' he said , `` that is an objection .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 6]: That is a serious objection .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 7]: I see no way out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: There was a general silence for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 31]: Then Hawkins said : `` It seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together -- '' The earl grasped him by the hand and shook it gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 11]: `` It solves the whole problem , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 18]: `` One ship , one funeral , one grave , one monument -- it is admirably conceived .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 32]: It does you honor , Major Hawkins , it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and distress , and it will save that poor stricken old father much suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 11]: Yes , he shall go over in one basket . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: asked the wife .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 7]: `` To-morrow-immediately , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 8]: `` I would wait , Mulberry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 3]: `` Wait ?
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 15]: `` You do n't want to break that childless old man 's heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 8]: `` God knows I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 12]: `` Then wait till he sends for his son 's remains .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 33]: If you do that , you will never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can know -- I mean , the certainty that his son is dead .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 7]: For he will never send . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 7]: `` Why wo n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 48]: `` Because to send -- and find out the truth -- would rob him of the one precious thing left him , the uncertainty , the dim hope that maybe , after all , his boy escaped , and he will see him again some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 17]: `` Why Polly , he 'll know by the papers that he was burnt up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 43]: `` He wo n't let himself believe the papers ; he 'll argue against anything and everything that proves his son is dead ; and he will keep that up and live on it , and on nothing else till he dies .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 29]: But if the remains should actually come , and be put before that poor old dim-hoping soul -- '' `` Oh , my God , they never shall !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 19]: Polly , you 've saved me from a crime , and I 'll bless you for it always .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: Now we know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 14]: We 'll place them reverently away , and he shall never know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 62]: The young Lord Berkeley , with the fresh air of freedom in his nostrils , was feeling invincibly strong for his new career ; and yet -- and yet -- if the fight should prove a very hard one at first , very discouraging , very taxing on untoughened moral sinews , he might in some weak moment want to retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 12]: Not likely , of course , but possibly that might happen .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 17]: And so on the whole it might be pardonable caution to burn his bridges behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 5]: Oh , without doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 33]: He must not stop with advertising for the owner of that money , but must put it where he could not borrow from it himself , meantime , under stress of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 26]: So he went down town , and put in his advertisement , then went to a bank and handed in the $ 500 for deposit .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 5]: `` What name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 15]: He hesitated and colored a little ; he had forgotten to make a selection .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 16]: He now brought out the first one that suggested itself : `` Howard Tracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 17]: When he was gone the clerks , marveling , said : `` The cowboy blushed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: The first step was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 22]: The money was still under his command and at his disposal , but the next step would dispose of that difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 17]: He went to another bank and drew upon the first bank for the 500 by check .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: The money was collected and deposited a second time to the credit of Howard Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 16]: He was asked to leave a few samples of his signature , which he did .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 40]: Then he went away , once more proud and of perfect courage , saying : `` No help for me now , for henceforth I could n't draw that money without identification , and that is become legally impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 7]: No resources to fall back on .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 11]: It is work or starve from now to the end .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 9]: I am ready -- and not afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 16]: Then he sent this cablegram to his father : `` Escaped unhurt from burning hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 5]: Have taken fictitious name .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 3]: Goodbye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 44]: During the evening while he was wandering about in one of the outlying districts of the city , he came across a small brick church , with a bill posted there with these words printed on it : `` MECHANICS ' CLUB DEBATE .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: ALL INVITED . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 23]: He saw people , apparently mainly of the working class , entering the place , and he followed and took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 13]: It was a humble little church , quite bare as to ornamentation .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 20]: It had painted pews without cushions , and no pulpit , properly speaking , but it had a platform .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 37]: On the platform sat the chairman , and by his side sat a man who held a manuscript in his hand and had the waiting look of one who is going to perform the principal part .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 18]: The church was soon filled with a quiet and orderly congregation of decently dressed and modest people .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 35]: This is what the chairman said : `` The essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you all know , Mr. Parker , assistant editor of the Daily Democrat .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 30]: The subject of his essay is the American Press , and he will use as his text a couple of paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold 's new book .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: He asks me to read these texts for him .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 34]: The first is as follows : '' ` Goethe says somewhere that `` the thrill of awe , '' that is to say , REVERENCE , is the best thing humanity has . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 49]: `` Mr. Arnold 's other paragraph is as follows : '' ' I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface and kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect , one could not do better than take the American newspapers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 13]: Mr. Parker rose and bowed , and was received with warm applause .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 24]: He then began to read in a good round resonant voice , with clear enunciation and careful attention to his pauses and emphases .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: His points were received with approval as he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 56]: The essayist took the position that the most important function of a public journal in any country was the propagating of national feeling and pride in the national name -- the keeping the people `` in love with their country and its institutions , and shielded from the allurements of alien and inimical systems . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 36]: He sketched the manner in which the reverent Turkish or Russian journalist fulfilled this function -- the one assisted by the prevalent `` discipline of respect '' for the bastinado , the other for Siberia .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 43]: Continuing , he said : The chief function of an English journal is that of all other journals the world over : it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon certain things , and keep it diligently diverted from certain others .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 97]: For instance , it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon the glories of England , a processional splendor stretching its receding line down the hazy vistas of time , with the mellowed lights of a thousand years glinting from its banners ; and it must keep it diligently diverted from the fact that all these glories were for the enrichment and aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few , at cost of the blood and sweat and poverty of the unconsidered masses who achieved them but might not enter in and partake of them .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 99]: It must keep the public eye fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a sacred thing , and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was ever set up by the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation ; and that hence no throne exists that has a right to exist , and no symbol of it , flying from any flagstaff , is righteously entitled to wear any device but the skull and crossbones of that kindred industry which differs from royalty only business-wise -- merely as retail differs from wholesale .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 86]: It must keep the citizen 's eye fixed in reverent docility upon that curious invention of machine politics , an Established Church , and upon that bald contradiction of common justice , a hereditary nobility ; and diligently divert it from the fact that the one damns him if he does n't wear its collar , and robs him under the gentle name of taxation whether he wears it or not , and the other gets all the honors while he does all the work .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 94]: The essayist thought that Mr. Arnold , with his trained eye and intelligent observation , ought to have perceived that the very quality which he so regretfully missed from our press -- respectfulness , reverence -- was exactly the thing which would make our press useless to us if it had it -- rob it of the very thing which differentiates it from all other journalism in the world and makes it distinctively and preciously American , its frank and cheerful irreverence being by all odds the most valuable of all its qualities .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 27]: `` For its mission -- overlooked by Mr. Arnold -- is to stand guard over a nation 's liberties , not its humbugs and shams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 40]: He thought that if during fifty years the institutions of the old world could be exposed to the fire of a flouting and scoffing press like ours , `` monarchy and its attendant crimes would disappear from Christendom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 21]: Monarchists might doubt this ; then `` why not persuade the Czar to give it a trial in Russia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 25]: Concluding , he said : Well , the charge is , that our press has but little of that old world quality , reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 10]: Let us be candidly grateful that it is so .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 39]: With its limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation reveres , as a rule , and that is sufficient : what other people revere is fairly and properly matter of light importance to us .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 114]: Our press does not reverence kings , it does not reverence so called nobilities , it does not reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries , it does not reverence laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one , it does not reverence any fraud or sham or infamy , howsoever old or rotten or holy , which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth : it does not reverence any law or custom , howsoever old or decayed or sacred , which shuts against the best man in the land the best place in the land and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy it .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 42]: In the sense of the poet Goethe -- that meek idolater of provincial three carat royalty and nobility -- our press is certainly bankrupt in the `` thrill of awe '' -- otherwise reverence ; reverence for nickel plate and brummagem .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 54]: Let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact forever : for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and protector of human liberty -- even as the other thing is the creator , nurse , and steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery , bodily and mental .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 20]: Tracy said to himself , almost shouted to himself , `` I 'm glad I came to this country .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 4]: I was right .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 22]: I was right to seek out a land where such healthy principles and theories are in men 's hearty and minds .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 10]: Think of the innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 13]: How well he brought that out , and how true it is .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 8]: There 's manifestly prodigious force in reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 16]: If you can get a man to reverence your ideals , he 's your slave .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 55]: Oh , yes , in all the ages the peoples of Europe have been diligently taught to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and nobility , been taught to avoid examining them , been taught to reverence them ; and now , as a natural result , to reverence them is second nature .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 21]: In order to shock them it is sufficient to inject a thought of the opposite kind into their dull minds .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 17]: For ages , any expression of so-called irreverence from their lips has been sin and crime .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 33]: The sham and swindle of all this is apparent the moment one reflects that he is himself the only legitimately qualified judge of what is entitled to reverence and what is not .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 18]: Come , I had n't thought of that before , but it is true , absolutely true .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 24]: What right has Goethe , what right has Arnold , what right has any dictionary , to define the word Irreverence for me ?
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 9]: What their ideals are is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 25]: So long as I reverence my own ideals my whole duty is done , and I commit no profanation if I laugh at theirs .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 15]: I may scoff at other people 's ideals as much as I want to .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 8]: It is my right and my privilege .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 10]: No man has any right to deny it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 15]: Tracy was expecting to hear the essay debated , but this did not happen .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 45]: The chairman said , by way of explanation : `` I would say , for the information of the strangers present here , that in accordance with our custom the subject of this meeting will be debated at the next meeting of the club .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 34]: This is in order to enable our members to prepare what they may wish to say upon the subject with pen and paper , for we are mainly mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 13]: We are obliged to write down what we desire to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 52]: Many brief papers were now read , and several offhand speeches made in discussion of the essay read at the last meeting of the club , which had been a laudation , by some visiting professor , of college culture , and the grand results flowing from it to the nation .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 57]: One of the papers was read by a man approaching middle age , who said he had n't had a college education , that he had got his education in a printing office , and had graduated from there into the patent office , where he had been a clerk now for a great many years .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 33]: Then he continued to this effect : The essayist contrasted the America of to-day with the America of bygone times , and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty progress .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 17]: But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share in the production of that result .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 42]: It can no doubt be easily shown that the colleges have contributed the intellectual part of this progress , and that that part is vast ; but that the material progress has been immeasurably vaster , I think you will concede .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 29]: Now I have been looking over a list of inventors -- the creators of this amazing material development -- and I find that they were not college-bred men .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 28]: Of course there are exceptions -- like Professor Henry of Princeton , the inventor of Mr. Morse 's system of telegraphy -- but these exceptions are few .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 35]: It is not overstatement to say that the imagination-stunning material development of this century , the only century worth living in since time itself was invented , is the creation of men not college-bred .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 40]: We think we see what these inventors have done : no , we see only the visible vast frontage of their work ; behind it is their far vaster work , and it is invisible to the careless glance .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 30]: They have reconstructed this nation -- made it over , that is -- and metaphorically speaking , have multiplied its numbers almost beyond the power of figures to express .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: I will explain what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 8]: What constitutes the population of a land ?
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 17]: Merely the numberable packages of meat and bones in it called by courtesy men and women ?
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 21]: Shall a million ounces of brass and a million ounces of gold be held to be of the same value ?
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 53]: Take a truer standard : the measure of a man 's contributing capacity to his time and his people -- the work he can do -- and then number the population of this country to-day , as multiplied by what a man can now do , more than his grandfather could do .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 33]: By this standard of measurement , this nation , two or three generations ago , consisted of mere cripples , paralytics , dead men , as compared with the men of to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 7]: In 1840 our population was 17,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 52]: By way of rude but striking illustration , let us consider , for argument 's sake , that four of these millions consisted of aged people , little children , and other incapables , and that the remaining 13,000,000 were divided and employed as follows : 2,000,000 as ginners of cotton .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: 6,000,000 -LRB- women -RRB- as stocking-knitters .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 7]: 2,000,000 -LRB- women -RRB- as thread-spinners .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 5]: 500,000 as screw makers .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 8]: 400,000 as reapers , binders , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 5]: 1,000,000 as corn shellers .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 4]: 40,000 as weavers .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: 1,000 as stitchers of shoe soles .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 21]: Now the deductions which I am going to append to these figures may sound extravagant , but they are not .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 21]: I take them from Miscellaneous Documents No. 50 , second session 45th Congress , and they are official and trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 102]: To-day , the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners is done by 2,000 men ; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters is done by 3,000 boys ; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners is done by 1,000 girls ; that of the 500,000 screw makers is done by 500 girls ; that of the 400,000 reapers , binders , etc. , is done by 4,000 boys ; that of the 1,000,000 corn shelters is done by 7,500 men ; that of the 40,000 weavers is done by 1,200 men ; and that of the 1,000 stitchers of shoe soles is done by 6 men .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 28]: To bunch the figures , 17,900 persons to-day do the above-work , whereas fifty years ago it would have taken thirteen millions of persons to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 29]: Now then , how many of that ignorant race -- our fathers and grandfathers -- with their ignorant methods , would it take to do our work to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 25]: It would take forty thousand millions -- a hundred times the swarming population of China -- twenty times the present population of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 43]: You look around you and you see a nation of sixty millions -- apparently ; but secreted in their hands and brains , and invisible to your eyes , is the true population of this Republic , and it numbers forty billions !
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 19]: It is the stupendous creation of those humble unlettered , un-college-bred inventors -- all honor to their name .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 7]: `` How grand that is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 8]: said Tracy , as he wended homeward .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 14]: `` What a civilization it is , and what prodigious results these are !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 35]: and brought about almost wholly by common men ; not by Oxford-trained aristocrats , but men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the humble ranks of life and earn the bread that they eat .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 8]: Again , I 'm glad I came .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 54]: I have found a country at last where one may start fair , and breast to breast with his fellow man , rise by his own efforts , and be something in the world and be proud of that something ; not be something created by an ancestor three hundred years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 30]: During the first few days he kept the fact diligently before his mind that he was in a land where there was `` work and bread for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 49]: In fact , for convenience ' sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed it to himself ; but as time wore on the fact itself began to take on a doubtful look , and next the tune got fatigued and presently ran down and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 28]: His first effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of the departments , where his Oxford education could come into play and do him service .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 7]: But he stood no chance whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 19]: There , competency was no recommendation ; political backing , without competency , was worth six of it .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 36]: He was glaringly English , and that was necessarily against him in the political centre of a nation where both parties prayed for the Irish cause on the house-top and blasphemed it in the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 30]: By his dress he was a cowboy ; that won him respect -- when his back was not turned -- but it could n't get a clerkship for him .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 47]: But he had said , in a rash moment , that he would wear those clothes till the owner or the owner 's friends caught sight of them and asked for that money , and his conscience would not let him retire from that engagement now .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 16]: At the end of a week things were beginning to wear rather a startling look .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 60]: He had hunted everywhere for work , descending gradually the scale of quality , until apparently he had sued for all the various kinds of work a man without a special calling might hope to be able to do , except ditching and the other coarse manual sorts -- and had got neither work nor the promise of it .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 83]: He was mechanically turning over the leaves of his diary , meanwhile , and now his eye fell upon the first record made after he was burnt out : `` I myself did not doubt my stamina before , nobody could doubt it now , if they could see how I am housed , and realise that I feel absolutely no disgust with these quarters , but am as serenely content with them as any dog would be in a similar kennel .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 7]: Terms , twenty-five dollars a week .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 9]: I said I would start at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 7]: I have kept my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 19]: A shudder went quaking through him , and he exclaimed : `` What have I been thinking of !
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 4]: This the bottom !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: Mooning along a whole week , and these terrific expenses climbing and climbing all the time !
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 8]: I must end this folly straightway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 14]: He settled up at once and went forth to find less sumptuous lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 14]: He had to wander far and seek with diligence , but he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 23]: They made him pay in advance -- four dollars and a half ; this secured both bed and food for a week .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 22]: The good-natured , hardworked landlady took him up three flights of narrow , uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his room .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: There were two double-bedsteads in it , and one single one .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 28]: He would be allowed to sleep alone in one of the double beds until some new boarder should come , but he would n't be charged extra .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 12]: So he would presently be required to sleep with some stranger !
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 8]: The thought of it made him sick .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 25]: Mrs. Marsh , the landlady , was very friendly and hoped he would like her house -- they all liked it , she said .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: `` And they 're a very nice set of boys .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 13]: They carry on a good deal , but that 's their fun .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 40]: You see , this room opens right into this back one , and sometimes they 're all in one and sometimes in the other ; and hot nights they all sleep on the roof when it do n't rain .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 11]: They get out there the minute it 's hot enough .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 17]: The season 's so early that they 've already had a night or two up there .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 16]: If you 'd like to go up and pick out a place , you can .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 17]: You 'll find chalk in the side of the chimney where there 's a brick wanting .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 17]: You just take the chalk and -- but of course you 've done it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , I have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 15]: `` Why , of course you have n't -- what am I thinking of ?
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 14]: Plenty of room on the Plains without chalking , I 'll be bound .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 33]: Well , you just chalk out a place the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that ai n't already marked off , you know , and that 's your property .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 41]: You and your bed-mate take turnabout carrying up the blanket and pillows and fetching them down again ; or one carries them up and the other fetches them down , you fix it the way you like , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 15]: You 'll like the boys , they 're everlasting sociable -- except the printer .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 39]: He 's the one that sleeps in that single bed -- the strangest creature ; why , I do n't believe you could get that man to sleep with another man , not if the house was afire .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 12]: Mind you , I 'm not just talking , I know .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 8]: The boys tried him , to see .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 71]: They took his bed out one night , and so when he got home about three in the morning -- he was on a morning paper then , but he 's on an evening one now -- there was n't any place for him but with the iron-moulder ; and if you 'll believe me , he just set up the rest of the night -- he did , honest .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 21]: They say he 's cracked , but it ai n't so , he 's English -- they 're awful particular .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 8]: You wo n't mind my saying that .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 7]: You -- you 're English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 38]: I could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words that 's got a 's in them , you know ; such as saying loff when you mean laff -- but you 'll get over that .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 38]: He 's a right down good fellow , and a little sociable with the photographer 's boy and the caulker and the blacksmith that work in the navy yard , but not so much with the others .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 63]: The fact is , though it 's private , and the others do n't know it , he 's a kind of an aristocrat , his father being a doctor , and you know what style that is -- in England , I mean , because in this country a doctor ai n't so very much , even if he 's that .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 9]: But over there of course it 's different .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 38]: So this chap had a falling out with his father , and was pretty high strung , and just cut for this country , and the first he knew he had to get to work or starve .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 26]: Well , he 'd been to college , you see , and so he judged he was all right -- did you say anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 8]: `` No -- I only sighed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 9]: `` And there 's where he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 7]: Why , he mighty near starved .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 31]: And I reckon he would have starved sure enough , if some jour ' printer or other had n't took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 20]: So he learnt the trade , and then he was all right -- but it was a close call .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 25]: Once he thought he had got to haul in his pride and holler for his father and -- why , you 're sighing again .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 7]: Is anything the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 13]: -- does my clatter -- '' `` Oh , dear -- no .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 9]: Pray go on -- I like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 87]: `` Yes , you see , he 's been over here ten years ; he 's twenty-eight , now , and he ai n't pretty well satisfied in his mind , because he ca n't get reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics , he being , as he says to me , a gentleman , which is a pretty plain letting-on that the boys ai n't , but of course I know enough not to let that cat out of the bag . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 12]: `` Why -- would there be any harm in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 5]: `` Harm in it ?
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 9]: They 'd lick him , would n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 4]: Would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 5]: Of course you would .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 17]: Do n't you ever let a man say you ai n't a gentleman in this country .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 9]: But laws , what am I thinking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 18]: I reckon a body would think twice before he said a cowboy was n't a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 27]: A trim , active , slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked into the room now , in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 46]: She was cheaply but smartly and gracefully dressed , and the mother 's quick glance at the stranger 's face as he rose , was of the kind which inquires what effect has been produced , and expects to find indications of surprise and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 12]: `` This is my daughter Hattie -- we call her Puss .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: It 's the new boarder , Puss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 4]: This without rising .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 75]: The young Englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and time of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty , and these were of that sort ; for , being taken by surprise , his natural , lifelong self sprang to the front , and that self of course would not know just how to act when introduced to a chambermaid , or to the heiress of a mechanics ' boarding house .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 35]: His other self -- the self which recognized the equality of all men -- would have managed the thing better , if it had n't been caught off guard and robbed of its chance .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 33]: The young girl paid no attention to the bow , but put out her hand frankly and gave the stranger a friendly shake and said : `` How do you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 62]: Then she marched to the one washstand in the room , tilted her head this way and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it , dampened her fingers with her tongue , perfected the circle of a little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead , then began to busy herself with the slops .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 15]: `` Well , I must be going -- it 's getting towards supper time .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 19]: Make yourself at home , Mr. Tracy , you 'll hear the bell when it 's ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 19]: The landlady took her tranquil departure , without commanding either of the young people to vacate the room .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 47]: The young man wondered a little that a mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so thoughtless , and was reaching for his hat , intending to disembarrass the girl of his presence ; but she said : `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 29]: `` Well -- nowhere in particular , but as I am only in the way here -- '' `` Why , who said you were in the way ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 15]: Sit down -- I 'll move you when you are in the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 8]: She was making the beds , now .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 11]: He sat down and watched her deft and diligent performance .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 7]: `` What gave you that notion ?
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 19]: Do you reckon I need a whole room just to make up a bed or two in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 11]: `` Well no , it was n't that , exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 35]: We are away up here in an empty house , and your mother being gone -- '' The girl interrupted him with an amused laugh , and said : `` Nobody to protect me ?
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 9]: Bless you , I do n't need it .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: I 'm not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 21]: I might be if I was alone , because I do hate ghosts , and I do n't deny it .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 12]: Not that I believe in them , for I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 9]: I 'm only just afraid of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 17]: `` How can you be afraid of them if you do n't believe in them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 26]: `` Oh , I do n't know the how of it -- that 's too many for me ; I only know it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 9]: It 's the same with Maggie Lee . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 6]: `` Who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 15]: `` One of the boarders ; young lady that works in the factry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: `` She works in a factory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 4]: Shoe factory . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 15]: `` In a shoe factory ; and you call her a young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 15]: `` Why , she 's only twenty-two ; what should you call her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 16]: `` I was n't thinking of her age , I was thinking of the title .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 32]: The fact is , I came away from England to get away from artificial forms -- for artificial forms suit artificial people only -- and here you 've got them too .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 4]: I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 18]: I hoped you had only men and women ; everybody equal ; no differences in rank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 29]: The girl stopped with a pillow in her teeth and the case spread open below it , contemplating him from under her brows with a slightly puzzled expression .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 15]: She released the pillow and said : `` Why , they are all equal .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 8]: Where 's any difference in rank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 21]: `` If you call a factory girl a young lady , what do you call the President 's wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 8]: `` Call her an old one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 11]: `` Oh , you make age the only distinction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 16]: `` There ai n't any other to make as far as I can see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 8]: `` Then all women are ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 5]: `` Certainly they are .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 6]: All the respectable ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 11]: `` Well , that puts a better face on it .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 15]: Certainly there is no harm in a title when it is given to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 17]: It is only an offense and a wrong when it is restricted to a favored few .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 10]: But Miss -- er -- '' `` Hattie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 19]: `` Miss Hattie , be frank ; confess that that title is n't accorded by everybody to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 17]: The rich American does n't call her cook a lady -- is n't that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 7]: `` Yes , it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 5]: What of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 20]: He was surprised and a little disappointed , to see that his admirable shot had produced no perceptible effect .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 6]: `` What of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 24]: `` Why this : equality is not conceded here , after all , and the Americans are no better off than the English .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 8]: In fact there 's no difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: `` Now what an idea .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 19]: There 's nothing in a title except what is put into it -- you 've said that yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 14]: Suppose the title is ` clean , ' instead of ` lady . '
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 5]: You get that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 5]: `` I believe so .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 22]: Instead of speaking of a woman as a lady , you substitute clean and say she 's a clean person . ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 18]: In England the swell folks do n't speak of the working people as gentlemen and ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 6]: `` Oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 14]: `` And the working people do n't call themselves gentlemen and ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 5]: `` Certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 15]: `` So if you used the other word there would n't be any change .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 34]: The swell people would n't call anybody but themselves ` clean , ' and those others would drop sort of meekly into their way of talking and they would n't call themselves clean .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: We do n't do that way here .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 34]: Everybody calls himself a lady or gentleman , and thinks he is , and do n't care what anybody else thinks him , so long as he do n't say it out loud .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 7]: You think there 's no difference .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 8]: You knuckle down and we do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 7]: Ai n't that a difference ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 15]: `` It is a difference I had n't thought of ; I admit that .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 26]: Still -- calling one 's self a lady does n't -- er -- '' `` I would n't go on if I were you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 17]: Howard Tracy turned his head to see who it might be that had introduced this remark .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 40]: It was a short man about forty years old , with sandy hair , no beard , and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelligent , and he wore slop-shop clothing which was neat but showed wear .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 31]: He had come from the front room beyond the hall , where he had left his hat , and he had a chipped and cracked white wash-bowl in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 8]: The girl came and took the bowl .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: `` I 'll get it for you .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 13]: You go right ahead and give it to him , Mr. Barrow .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 25]: He 's the new boarder -- Mr. Tracy -- and I 'd just got to where it was getting too deep for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 9]: `` Much obliged if you will , Hattie .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 10]: I was coming to borrow of the boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 40]: He sat down at his ease on an old trunk , and said , `` I 've been listening and got interested ; and as I was saying , I would n't go on , if I were you .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 12]: You see where you are coming to , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 54]: Calling yourself a lady does n't elect you ; that is what you were going to say ; and you saw that if you said it you were going to run right up against another difference that you had n't thought of : to-wit , Whose right is it to do the electing ?
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 35]: Over there , twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves gentlemen and ladies , and the nine hundred and eighty thousand accept that decree and swallow the affront which it puts upon them .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 29]: Why , if they did n't accept it , it would n't be an election , it would be a dead letter and have no force at all .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 21]: Over here the twenty thousand would-be exclusives come up to the polls and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 8]: But the thing does n't stop there .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 24]: The nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen too , and that elects the whole nation .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 18]: Since the whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen , there is no question about that election .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 49]: It does make absolute equality , and there is no fiction about it ; while over yonder the inequality , -LRB- by decree of the infinitely feeble , and consent of the infinitely strong , -RRB- is also absolute -- as real and absolute as our equality . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 92]: Tracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell when this speech began , notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks for contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herd 's terms ; but he lost no time in pulling himself out again , and so by the time the speech was finished his valves were open once more , and he was forcing himself to accept without resentment the common herd 's frank fashion of dropping sociably into other people 's conversations unembarrassed and uninvited .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 23]: The process was not very difficult this time , for the man 's smile and voice and manner were persuasive and winning .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 55]: Tracy would even have liked him on the spot , but for the fact -- fact which he was not really aware of -- that the equality of men was not yet a reality to him , it was only a theory ; the mind perceived , but the man failed to feel it .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 12]: It was Hattie 's ghost over again , merely turned around .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 17]: Theoretically Barrow was his equal , but it was distinctly distasteful to see him exhibit it .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 33]: He presently said : `` I hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true , as regards the Americans , for doubts have crept into my mind several times .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 47]: It seemed that the equality must be ungenuine where the sign-names of castes were still in vogue ; but those sign-names have certainly lost their offence and are wholly neutralized , nullified and harmless if they are the undisputed property of every individual in the nation .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 25]: I think I realize that caste does not exist and can not exist except by common consent of the masses outside of its limits .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 46]: I thought caste created itself and perpetuated itself ; but it seems quite true that it only creates itself , and is perpetuated by the people whom it despises , and who can dissolve it at any time by assuming its mere sign-names themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 7]: `` It 's what I think .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 26]: There is n't any power on earth that can prevent England 's thirty millions from electing themselves dukes and duchesses to-morrow and calling themselves so .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 17]: And within six months all the former dukes and duchesses would have retired from the business .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: I wish they 'd try that .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 9]: Royalty itself could n't survive such a process .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 14]: A handful of frowners against thirty million laughers in a state of irruption .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 22]: Why , it 's Herculaneum against Vesuvius ; it would take another eighteen centuries to find that Herculaneum after the cataclysm .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 8]: What 's a Colonel in our South ?
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 13]: He 's a nobody ; because they 're all colonels down there .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 64]: No , Tracy '' -LRB- shudder from Tracy -RRB- `` nobody in England would call you a gentleman and you would n't call yourself one ; and I tell you it 's a state of things that makes a man put himself into most unbecoming attitudes sometimes -- the broad and general recognition and acceptance of caste as caste does , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 22]: Makes him do it unconsciously -- being bred in him , you see , and never thought over and reasoned out .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 25]: You could n't conceive of the Matterhorn being flattered by the notice of one of your comely little English hills , could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 6]: `` Why , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 26]: `` Well , then , let a man in his right mind try to conceive of Darwin feeling flattered by the notice of a princess .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 14]: It 's so grotesque that it -- well , it paralyzes the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 20]: Yet that Memnon was flattered by the notice of that statuette ; he says so -- says so himself .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 38]: The system that can make a god disown his godship and profane it -- oh , well , it 's all wrong , it 's all wrong and ought to be abolished , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 72]: The mention of Darwin brought on a literary discussion , and this topic roused such enthusiasm in Barrow that he took off his coat and made himself the more free and comfortable for it , and detained him so long that he was still at it when the noisy proprietors of the room came shouting and skylarking in and began to romp , scuffle , wash , and otherwise entertain themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 35]: He lingered yet a little longer to offer the hospitalities of his room and his book shelf to Tracy and ask him a personal question or two : `` What is your trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 17]: `` They -- well , they call me a cowboy , but that is a fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 5]: I 'm not that .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 7]: I have n't any trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 11]: `` What do you work at for your living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 33]: `` Oh , anything -- I mean I would work at , anything I could get to do , but thus far I have n't been able to find an occupation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 14]: `` Maybe I can help you ; I 'd like to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 7]: `` I shall be very glad .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 10]: I 've tried , myself , to weariness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 22]: `` Well , of course where a man has n't a regular trade he 's pretty bad off in this world .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 16]: What you needed , I reckon , was less book learning and more bread-and-butter learning .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 13]: I do n't know what your father could have been thinking of .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 20]: You ought to have had a trade , you ought to have had a trade , by all means .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 17]: But never mind about that ; we 'll stir up something to do , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 13]: And do n't you get homesick ; that 's a bad business .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: We 'll talk the thing over and look around a little .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 7]: You 'll come out all right .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 14]: Wait for me -- I 'll go down to supper with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 37]: By this time Tracy had achieved a very friendly feeling for Barrow and would have called him a friend , maybe , if not taken too suddenly on a straight-out requirement to realize on his theories .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 17]: He was glad of his society , anyway , and was feeling lighter hearted than before .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 31]: Also he was pretty curious to know what vocation it might be which had furnished Barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him so much time to read .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 33]: Presently the supper bell began to ring in the depths of the house , and the sound proceeded steadily upward , growing in intensity all the way up towards the upper floors .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 41]: The higher it came the more maddening was the noise , until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening , was made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders down the uncarpeted stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 27]: The peerage did not go to meals in this fashion ; Tracy 's training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious zoological clamor and enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 29]: He had to confess that there was something about this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he would have to get inured to before he could accept it .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 33]: No doubt in time he would prefer it ; but he wished the process might be modified and made just a little more gradual , and not quite so pronounced and violent .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 64]: Barrow and Tracy followed the avalanche down through an ever increasing and ever more and more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage and kindred smells ; smells which are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private boarding house ; smells which once encountered can never be forgotten ; smells which encountered generations later are instantly recognizable , but never recognizable with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 21]: To Tracy these odors were suffocating , horrible , almost unendurable ; but he held his peace and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 21]: Arrived in the basement , they entered a large dining-room where thirty-five or forty people sat at a long table .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: They took their places .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 25]: The feast had already begun and the conversation was going on in the liveliest way from one end of the table to the other .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 18]: The table cloth was of very coarse material and was liberally spotted with coffee stains and grease .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 26]: The knives and forks were iron , with bone handles , the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron or something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 17]: The tea and coffee cups were of the commonest and heaviest and most durable stone ware .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 14]: All the furniture of the table was of the commonest and cheapest sort .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 34]: There was a single large thick slice of bread by each boarder 's plate , and it was observable that he economized it as if he were not expecting it to be duplicated .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 29]: Dishes of butter were distributed along the table within reach of people 's arms , if they had long ones , but there were no private butter plates .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 38]: The butter was perhaps good enough , and was quiet and well behaved ; but it had more bouquet than was necessary , though nobody commented upon that fact or seemed in any way disturbed by it .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 27]: The main feature of the feast was a piping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a procession of previous meals .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 8]: Everybody was liberally supplied with this dish .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 32]: On the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham , and there were some other eatables of minor importance -- preserves and New Orleans molasses and such things .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 59]: There was also plenty of tea and coffee of an infernal sort , with brown sugar and condensed milk , but the milk and sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the boarders , but was rationed out at headquarters -- one spoonful of sugar and one of condensed milk to each cup and no more .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 28]: The table was waited upon by two stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the bases of supplies with splendid dash and clatter and energy .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 13]: Their labors were supplemented after a fashion by the young girl Puss .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 29]: She carried coffee and tea back and forth among the boarders , but she made pleasure excursions rather than business ones in this way , to speak strictly .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 7]: She made jokes with various people .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 35]: She chaffed the young men pleasantly and wittily , as she supposed , and as the rest also supposed , apparently , judging by the applause and laughter which she got by her efforts .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 19]: Manifestly she was a favorite with most of the young fellows and sweetheart of the rest of them .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 46]: Where she conferred notice she conferred happiness , as was seen by the face of the recipient ; and ; at the same time she conferred unhappiness -- one could see it fall and dim the faces of the other young fellows like a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 37]: She never `` Mistered '' these friends of hers , but called them `` Billy , '' `` Tom , '' `` John , '' and they called her `` Puss '' or `` Hattie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 17]: Mr. Marsh sat at the head of the table , his wife sat at the foot .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 28]: Marsh was a man of sixty , and was an American ; but if he had been born a month earlier he would have been a Spaniard .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 51]: He was plenty good enough Spaniard as it was ; his face was very dark , his hair very black , and his eyes were not only exceedingly black but were very intense , and there was something about them that indicated that they could burn with passion upon occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 24]: He was stoop-shouldered and lean-faced , and the general aspect of him was disagreeable ; he was evidently not a very companionable person .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 28]: If looks went for anything , he was the very opposite of his wife , who was all motherliness and charity , good will and good nature .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 17]: All the young men and the women called her Aunt Rachael , which was another sign .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 22]: Tracy 's wandering and interested eye presently fell upon one boarder who had been overlooked in the distribution of the stew .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 36]: He was very pale and looked as if he had but lately come out of a sick bed , and also as if he ought to get back into it again as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 6]: His face was very melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 33]: The waves of laughter and conversation broke upon it without affecting it any more than if it had been a rock in the sea and the words and the laughter veritable waters .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 9]: He held his head down and looked ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 54]: Some of the women cast glances of pity toward him from time to time in a furtive and half afraid way , and some of the youngest of the men plainly had compassion on the young fellow -- a compassion exhibited in their faces but not in any more active or compromising way .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 18]: But the great majority of the people present showed entire indifference to the youth and his sorrows .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 22]: Marsh sat with his head down , but one could catch the malicious gleam of his eyes through his shaggy brows .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 10]: He was watching that young fellow with evident relish .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 16]: He had not neglected him through carelessness , and apparently the table understood that fact .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 9]: The spectacle was making Mrs. Marsh very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 16]: She had the look of one who hopes against hope that the impossible may happen .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 30]: But as the impossible did not happen , she finally ventured to speak up and remind her husband that Nat Brady had n't been helped to the Irish stew .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 22]: Marsh lifted his head and gasped out with mock courtliness , `` Oh , he has n't , has n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 6]: What a pity that is .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 11]: I do n't know how I came to overlook him .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 7]: Ah , he must pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 16]: You must indeed Mr -- er -- Baxter -- Barker , you must pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: I -- er -- my attention was directed to some other matter , I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 15]: The thing that grieves me mainly is , that it happens every meal now .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 20]: But you must try to overlook these little things , Mr. Bunker , these little neglects on my part .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 44]: They 're always likely to happen with me in any case , and they are especially likely to happen where a person has -- er -- well , where a person is , say , about three weeks in arrears for his board .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 5]: You get my meaning ?
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 6]: -- you get my idea ?
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 40]: Here is your Irish stew , and -- er -- it gives me the greatest pleasure to send it to you , and I hope that you will enjoy the charity as much as I enjoy conferring it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 49]: A blush rose in Brady 's white cheeks and flowed slowly backward to his ears and upward toward his forehead , but he said nothing and began to eat his food under the embarrassment of a general silence and the sense that all eyes were fastened upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 15]: Barrow whispered to Tracy : `` The old man 's been waiting for that .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 11]: He would n't have missed that chance for anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: `` It 's a brutal business , '' said Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 78]: Then he said to himself , purposing to set the thought down in his diary later : `` Well , here in this very house is a republic where all are free and equal , if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth , therefore I have arrived at the place I started to find , and I am a man among men , and on the strictest equality possible to men , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 10]: Yet here on the threshold I find an inequality .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 55]: There are people at this table who are looked up to for some reason or another , and here is a poor devil of a boy who is looked down upon , treated with indifference , and shamed by humiliations , when he has committed no crime but that common one of being poor .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 7]: Equality ought to make men noble-minded .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 11]: In fact I had supposed it did do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 12]: After supper , Barrow proposed a walk , and they started .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 5]: Barrow had a purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 11]: He wanted Tracy to get rid of that cowboy hat .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 20]: He did n't see his way to finding mechanical or manual employment for a person rigged in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 17]: Barrow presently said : `` As I understand it , you 're not a cowboy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 8]: `` No , I 'm not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 22]: `` Well , now if you will not think me too curious , how did you come to mount that hat ?
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 7]: Where 'd you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 45]: Tracy did n't know quite how to reply to this , but presently said , `` Well , without going into particulars ; I exchanged clothes with a stranger under stress of weather , and I would like to find him and re-exchange . ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 10]: `` Well , why do n't you find him ?
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 5]: Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 35]: I supposed the best way to find him would be to continue to wear his clothes , which are conspicuous enough to attract his attention if I should meet him on the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 41]: `` Oh , very well , '' said Barrow , `` the rest of the outfit , is well enough , and while it 's not too conspicuous , it is n't quite like the clothes that anybody else wears .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 4]: Suppress the hat .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 14]: When you meet your man he 'll recognize the rest of his suit .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 18]: That 's a mighty embarrassing hat , you know , in a centre of civilization like this .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 18]: I do n't believe an angel could get employment in Washington in a halo like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 29]: Tracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a modester form , and they stepped aboard a crowded car and stood with others on the rear platform .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 38]: Presently , as the car moved swiftly along the rails , two men crossing the street caught sight of the backs of Barrow and Tracy , and both exclaimed at once , `` There he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 6]: It was Sellers and Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 38]: Both were so paralyzed with joy that before they could pull themselves together and make an effort to stop the car , it was gone too far , and they decided to wait for the next one .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 32]: They waited a while ; then it occurred to Washington that there could be no use in chasing one horse-car with another , and he wanted to hunt up a hack .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 23]: But the Colonel said : `` When you come to think of it , there 's no occasion for that at all .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 14]: Now that I 've got him materialized , I can command his motions .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 15]: I 'll have him at the house by the time we get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 14]: Then they hurried off home in a state of great and joyful excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 19]: The hat exchange accomplished , the two new friends started to walk back leisurely to the boarding house .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 12]: Barrow 's mind was full of curiosity about this young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 14]: He said , `` You 've never been to the Rocky Mountains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 11]: `` You 've never been out on the plains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 11]: `` How long have you been in this country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 7]: `` Only a few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 10]: `` You 've never been in America before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 6]: Then Barrow communed with himself .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 12]: `` Now what odd shapes the notions of romantic people take .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 19]: Here 's a young , fellow who 's read in England about cowboys and adventures on the plains .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 10]: He comes here and buys a cowboy 's suit .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: Thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy , all inexperienced as he is .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 24]: Now the minute he 's caught in this poor little game , he 's ashamed of it and ready to retire from it .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: It is that exchange that he has put up as an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 9]: It 's rather thin , too thin altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 21]: Well , he 's young , never been anywhere , knows nothing about the world , sentimental , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 25]: Perhaps it was the natural thing for him to do , but it was a most singular choice , curious freak , altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 33]: Both men were busy with their thoughts for a time , then Tracy heaved a sigh and said , `` Mr. Barrow , the case of that young fellow troubles me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 7]: `` You mean Nat Brady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 13]: `` Yes , Brady , or Baxter , or whatever it was .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 11]: The old landlord called him by several different names . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 24]: `` Oh , yes , he has been very liberal with names for Brady , since Brady fell into arrears for his board .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 20]: Well , that 's one of his sarcasms -- the old man thinks he 's great on sarcasm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 9]: `` Well , what is Brady 's difficulty ?
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 9]: What is Brady -- who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 6]: `` Brady is a tinner .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 21]: He 's a young journeyman tinner who was getting along all right till he fell sick and lost his job .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 17]: He was very popular before he lost his job ; everybody in the house liked Brady .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 54]: The old man was rather especially fond of him , but you know that when a man loses his job and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as he goes , it makes a great difference in the way people look at him and feel about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: `` Is that so !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: Is it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 9]: Barrow looked at Tracy in a puzzled way .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 8]: `` Why of course it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 8]: Would n't you know that , naturally .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 20]: Do n't you know that the wounded deer is always attacked and killed by its companions and friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 47]: Tracy said to himself , while a chilly and boding discomfort spread itself through his system , `` In a republic of deer and men where all are free and equal , misfortune is a crime , and the prosperous gore the unfortunate to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 36]: Then he said aloud , `` Here in the boarding house , if one would have friends and be popular instead of having the cold shoulder turned upon him , he must be prosperous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' Barrow said , `` that is so .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 6]: It 's their human nature .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 69]: They do turn against Brady , now that he 's unfortunate , and they do n't like him as well as they did before ; but it is n't because of any lack in Brady -- he 's just as he was before , has the same nature and the same impulses , but they -- well , Brady is a thorn in their consciences , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 51]: They know they ought to help him and they 're too stingy to do it , and they 're ashamed of themselves for that , and they ought also to hate themselves on that account , but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes them ashamed of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 33]: I say that 's human nature ; that occurs everywhere ; this boarding house is merely the world in little , it 's the case all over -- they 're all alike .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 30]: In prosperity we are popular ; popularity comes easy in that case , but when the other thing comes our friends are pretty likely to turn against us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 16]: Tracy 's noble theories and high purposes were beginning to feel pretty damp and clammy .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 30]: He wondered if by any possibility he had made a mistake in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the cross of other people 's unprosperity .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 34]: But he would n't listen to that sort of thing ; he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead resolutely along the course he had mapped out for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 15]: Extracts from his diary : Have now spent several days in this singular hive .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 13]: I do n't know quite what to make out of these people .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 24]: They have merits and virtues , but they have some other qualities , and some ways that are hard to get along with .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 6]: I ca n't enjoy them .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 16]: The moment I appeared in a hat of the period , I noticed a change .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 49]: The respect which had been paid me before , passed suddenly away , and the people became friendly -- more than that -- they became familiar , and I 'm not used to familiarity , and ca n't take to it right off ; I find that out .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 10]: These people 's familiarity amounts to impudence , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 26]: I suppose it 's all right ; no doubt I can get used to it , but it 's not a satisfactory process at all .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 41]: I have accomplished my dearest wish , I am a man among men , on an equal footing with Tom , Dick and Harry , and yet it is n't just exactly what I thought it was going to be .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 6]: I -- I miss home .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 8]: Am obliged to say I am homesick .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 56]: Another thing -- and this is a confession -- a reluctant one , but I will make it : The thing I miss most and most severely , is the respect , the deference , with which I was treated all my life in England , and which seems to be somehow necessary to me .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 41]: I get along very well without the luxury and the wealth and the sort of society I 've been accustomed to , but I do miss the respect and ca n't seem to get reconciled to the absence of it .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 18]: There is respect , there is deference here , but it does n't fall to my share .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 7]: It is lavished on two men .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 16]: One of them is a portly man of middle age who is a retired plumber .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 10]: Everybody is pleased to have that man 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 35]: He 's full of pomp and circumstance and self complacency and bad grammar , and at table he is Sir Oracle and when he opens his mouth not any dog in the kennel barks .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 10]: The other person is a policeman at the capitol-building .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 5]: He represents the government .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 31]: The deference paid to these two men is not so very far short of that which is paid to an earl in England , though the method of it differs .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 12]: Not so much courtliness , but the deference is all there .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 9]: Yes , and there is obsequiousness , too .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 22]: It does rather look as if in a republic where all are free and equal , prosperity and position constitute rank .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 12]: The days drifted by , and they grew ever more dreary .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 12]: For Barrow 's efforts to find work for Tracy were unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 16]: Always the first question asked was , `` What Union do you belong to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 14]: Tracy was obliged to reply that he did n't belong to any trade-union .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 13]: `` Very well , then , it 's impossible to employ you .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 28]: My men would n't stay with me if I should employ a ` scab , ' or ` rat , ' '' or whatever the phrase was .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 8]: Finally , Tracy had a happy thought .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 22]: He said , `` Why the thing for me to do , of course , is to join a trade-union . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' Barrow said , `` that is the thing for you to do -- if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 5]: `` If I can ?
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 5]: Is it difficult ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 21]: `` Well , Yes , '' Barrow said , `` it 's sometimes difficult -- in fact , very difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 16]: But you can try , and of course it will be best to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 10]: Therefore Tracy tried ; but he did not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 36]: He was refused admission with a good deal of promptness , and was advised to go back home , where he belonged , not come here taking honest men 's bread out of their mouths .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 20]: Tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate , and the thought made him cold to the marrow .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 44]: He said to himself , `` So there is an aristocracy of position here , and an aristocracy of prosperity , and apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to the outs , and I am with the outs .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 8]: So the ranks grow daily , here .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: Plainly there are all kinds of castes here and only one that I belong to , the outcasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 27]: But he could n't even smile at his small joke , although he was obliged to confess that he had a rather good opinion of it .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 33]: He was feeling so defeated and miserable by this time that he could no longer look with philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the young fellows in the upper rooms at night .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 40]: At first it had been pleasant to see them unbend and have a good time after having so well earned it by the labors of the day , but now it all rasped upon his feelings and his dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 7]: He lost patience with the spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 73]: When they were feeling good , they shouted , they scuffled , they sang songs , they romped about the place like cattle , and they generally wound up with a pillow fight , in which they banged each other over the head , and threw the pillows in all directions , and every now and then he got a buffet himself ; and they were always inviting him to join in .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 19]: They called him `` Johnny Bull , '' and invited him with excessive familiarity to take a hand .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 44]: At first he had endured all this with good nature , but latterly he had shown by his manner that it was distinctly distasteful to him , and very soon he saw a change in the manner of these young people toward him .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 15]: They were souring on him as they would have expressed it in their language .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 10]: He had never been what might be called popular .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 22]: That was hardly the phrase for it ; he had merely been liked , but now dislike for him was growing .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 35]: His case was not helped by the fact that he was out of luck , could n't get work , did n't belong to a union , and could n't gain admission to one .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 44]: He got a good many slights of that small ill-defined sort that you ca n't quite put your finger on , and it was manifest that there was only one thing which protected him from open insult , and that was his muscle .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 41]: These young people had seen him exercising , mornings , after his cold sponge bath , and they had perceived by his performance and the build of his body , that he was athletic , and also versed in boxing .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 20]: He felt pretty naked now , recognizing that he was shorn of all respect except respect for his fists .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 27]: One night when he entered his room he found about a dozen of the young fellows there carrying on a very lively conversation punctuated with horse-laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 15]: The talking ceased instantly , and the frank affront of a dead silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 13]: He said , `` Good evening gentlemen , '' and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 5]: There was no response .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 12]: He flushed to the temples but forced himself to maintain silence .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 17]: He sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some time , then got up and went out .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 15]: The moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter break forth .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 12]: He saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 23]: He ascended to the flat roof , hoping to be able to cool down his spirit there and get back his tranquility .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 19]: He found the young tinner up there , alone and brooding , and entered into conversation with him .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 36]: They were pretty fairly matched , now , in unpopularity and general ill-luck and misery , and they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with advantage and something of comfort to both .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 38]: But Tracy 's movements had been watched , and in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one after another to the roof , where they began to stroll up and down in an apparently purposeless way .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 22]: But presently they fell to dropping remarks that were evidently aimed at Tracy , and some of them at the tinner .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 41]: The ringleader of this little mob was a short-haired bully and amateur prize-fighter named Allen , who was accustomed to lording it over the upper floor , and had more than once shown a disposition to make trouble with Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 38]: Now there was an occasional cat-call , and hootings , and whistlings , and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected remarks was introduced : `` How many does it take to make a pair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 25]: `` Well , two generally makes a pair , but sometimes there ai n't stuff enough in them to make a whole pair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 3]: General laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 13]: `` What were you saying about the English a while ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 26]: `` Oh , nothing , the English are all right , only -- I -- '' `` What was it you said about them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 11]: `` Oh , I only said they swallow well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 8]: `` Swallow better than other people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: `` Oh , yes , the English swallow a good deal better than other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 9]: `` What is it they swallow best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 6]: `` Oh , insults . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: Another general laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 13]: `` Pretty hard to make 'em fight , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 11]: `` No , taint hard to make 'em fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 8]: `` Ai n't it , really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 6]: `` No , taint hard .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 5]: It 's impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 3]: Another laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 13]: `` This one 's kind of spiritless , that 's certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 13]: `` Could n't be the other way -- in his case . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 12]: `` Do n't you know the secret of his birth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 10]: has he got a secret of his birth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 7]: `` You bet he has . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 8]: `` His father was a wax-figger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 30]: Allen came strolling by where the pair were sitting ; stopped , and said to the tinner ; `` How are you off for friends , these days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 6]: `` Well enough off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 7]: `` Got a good many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 10]: `` Well , as many as I need . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 15]: `` A friend is valuable , sometimes -- as a protector , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 24]: What do you reckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in the face with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 19]: `` Please do n't trouble me , Mr. Allen , I ai n't doing anything to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 5]: `` You answer me !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: What do you reckon would happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: `` Well , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 29]: Tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said : `` Do n't trouble the young fellow , I can tell you what would happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: `` Oh , you can , can you ?
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 29]: Boys , Johnny Bull can tell us what would happen if I was to snatch this chump 's cap off and slap him in the face with it .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 6]: Now you 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 41]: He snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face , and before he could inquire what was going to happen , it had already happened , and he was warming the tin with the broad of his back .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 21]: Instantly there was a rush , and shouts of : `` A ring , a ring , make a ring !
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 5]: Fair play all round !
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 10]: Johnny 's grit ; give him a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 34]: The ring was quickly chalked on the tin , and Tracy found himself as eager to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a prince instead of a mechanic .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 46]: At bottom he was a little surprised at this , because although his theories had been all in that direction for some time , he was not prepared to find himself actually eager to measure strength with quite so common a man as this ruffian .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 19]: In a moment all the windows in the neighborhood were filled with people , and the roofs also .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 10]: The men squared off , and the fight began .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 12]: But Allen stood no chance whatever , against the young Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 11]: Neither in muscle nor in science was he his equal .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 41]: He measured his length on the tin time and again ; in fact , as fast as he could get up he went down again , and the applause was kept up in liberal fashion from all the neighborhood around .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 9]: Finally , Allen had to be helped up .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 15]: Then Tracy declined to punish him further and the fight was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 79]: Allen was carried off by some of his friends in a very much humbled condition , his face black and blue and bleeding , and Tracy was at once surrounded by the young fellows , who congratulated him , and told him that he had done the whole house a service , and that from this out Mr. Allen would be a little more particular about how he handled slights and insults and maltreatment around amongst the boarders .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 10]: Tracy was a hero now , and exceedingly popular .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 14]: Perhaps nobody had ever been quite so popular on that upper floor before .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 27]: But if being discountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear , their lavish commendations and approval and hero-worship was harder still to endure .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 19]: He felt degraded , but he did not allow himself to analyze the reasons why , too closely .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 44]: He was content to satisfy himself with the suggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded by the public spectacle which he had made of himself , fighting on a tin roof , for the delectation of everybody a block or two around .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 12]: But he was n't entirely satisfied with that explanation of it .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 24]: Once he went a little too far and wrote in his diary that his case was worse than that of the prodigal son .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 18]: He said the prodigal son merely fed swine , he did n't have to chum with them .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 14]: But he struck that out , and said `` All men are equal .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 7]: I will not disown my principles .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 10]: These men are as good as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 10]: Tracy was become popular on the lower floors also .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 27]: Everybody was grateful for Allen 's reduction to the ranks , and for his transformation from a doer of outrages to a mere threatener of them .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 30]: The young girls , of whom there were half a dozen , showed many attentions to Tracy , particularly that boarding house pet Hattie , the landlady 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 18]: She said to him , very sweetly , `` I think you 're ever so nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 37]: And when he said , `` I 'm glad you think so , Miss Hattie , '' she said , still more sweetly , `` Do n't call me Miss Hattie -- call me Puss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 6]: Ah , here was promotion !
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 6]: He had struck the summit .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 12]: There were no higher heights to climb in that boarding house .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 5]: His popularity was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 26]: In the presence of people , Tracy showed a tranquil outside , but his heart was being eaten out of him by distress and despair .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 18]: In a little while he should be out of money , and then what should he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 19]: He wished , now , that he had borrowed a little more liberally from that stranger 's store .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 7]: He found it impossible to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 34]: A single torturing , terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head , wearing a groove in his brain : What should he do -- What was to become of him ?
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 65]: And along with it began to intrude a something presently which was very like a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of martyrdom , but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl and nothing better , with nothing more to do in this world of a useful sort than an earl finds to do .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 62]: But he smothered that part of his thought as well as he could ; he made every effort to drive it away , and with fair keep it from intruding a little success , but he could n't now and then , and when it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite , a sting , a burn .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 12]: He recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 17]: The others were painful enough , but that one cut to the quick when it calm .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 47]: Night after night he lay tossing to the music of the hideous snoring of the honest bread-winners until two and three o'clock in the morning , then got up and took refuge on the roof , where he sometimes got a nap and sometimes failed entirely .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 16]: His appetite was leaving him and the zest of life was going along with it .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 60]: Finally , owe day , being near the imminent verge of total discouragement , he said to himself -- and took occasion to blush privately when he said it , `` If my father knew what my American name is , -- he -- well , my duty to my father rather requires that I furnish him my name .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 24]: I have no right to make his days and nights unhappy , I can do enough unhappiness for the family all by myself .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: Really he ought to know what my American name is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 26]: He thought over it a while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this effect : `` My American name is Howard Tracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 7]: That would n't be suggesting anything .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 42]: His father could understand that as he chose , and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant , as a dutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old father happy for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 24]: Continuing his train of thought , Tracy said to himself , `` Ah , but if he should cable me to come home !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 15]: I -- I -- could n't do that -- I must n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 20]: I 've started out on a mission , and I must n't turn my back on it in cowardice .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 24]: No , no , I could n't go home , at -- at -- least I should n't want to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 52]: After a reflective pause : `` Well , maybe -- perhaps -- it would be my duty to go in the circumstances ; he 's very old and he does need me by him to stay his footsteps down the long hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 8]: Well , I 'll think about that .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 13]: Yes , of course it would n't be right to stay here .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 27]: If I -- well , perhaps I could just drop him a line and put it off a little while and satisfy him in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 20]: It would be -- well , it would mar everything to have him require me to come instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 27]: Another reflective pause -- then : `` And yet if he should do that I do n't know but -- oh , dear me -- home !
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 5]: how good it sounds !
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 20]: and a body is excusable for wanting to see his home again , now and then , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 53]: He went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the first end of what Barrow called the `` usual Washington courtesy , '' where `` they treat you as a tramp until they find out you 're a congressman , and then they slobber all over you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 14]: There was a boy of seventeen on duty there , tying his shoe .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 15]: He had his foot on a chair and his back turned towards the wicket .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 21]: He glanced over his shoulder , took Tracy 's measure , turned back , and went on tying his shoe .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 47]: Tracy finished writing his telegram and waited , still waited , and still waited , for that performance to finish , but there did n't seem to be any finish to it ; so finally Tracy said : `` Ca n't you take my telegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 33]: The youth looked over his shoulder and said , by his manner , not his words : `` Do n't you think you could wait a minute , if you tried ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 29]: However , he got the shoe tied at last , and came and took the telegram , glanced over it , then looked up surprised , at Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 42]: There was something in his look that bordered upon respect , almost reverence , it seemed to Tracy , although he had been so long without anything of this kind he was not sure that he knew the signs of it .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 15]: The boy read the address aloud , with pleased expression in face and voice .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 6]: `` The Earl of Rossmore !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 2]: Cracky !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 6]: Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: `` Is that so !
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 6]: Does he know you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 6]: `` Well -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 6]: `` Well , I swear !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 6]: Will he answer you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: `` I think he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 5]: `` Will he though ?
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 8]: Where 'll you have it sent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 5]: `` Oh , nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 8]: I 'll call here and get it .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 6]: When shall I call ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 15]: `` Oh , I do n't know -- I 'll send it to you .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 6]: Where shall I send it ?
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 17]: Give me your address ; I 'll send it to you soon 's it comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 9]: But Tracy did n't propose to do this .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 39]: He had acquired the boy 's admiration and deferential respect , and he was n't willing to throw these precious things away , a result sure to follow if he should give the address of that boarding house .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 18]: So he said again that he would call and get the telegram , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 6]: He idled along , reflecting .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 14]: He said to himself , `` There is something pleasant about being respected .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 31]: I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen and some of those others , and almost the deference of some of them on pure merit , for having thrashed Allen .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 31]: While their respect and their deference -- if it is deference -- is pleasant , a deference based upon a sham , a shadow , does really seem pleasanter still .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 29]: It 's no real merit to be in correspondence with an earl , and yet after all , that boy makes me feel as if there was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 7]: The cablegram was actually gone home !
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: the thought of it gave him an immense uplift .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: He walked with a lighter tread .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 7]: His heart was full of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 33]: He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself that he was glad through and through that he was going to give up this experiment and go back to his home again .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 25]: His eagerness to get his father 's answer began to grow , now , and it grew with marvelous celerity , after it began .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 47]: He waited an hour , walking about , putting in his time as well as he could , but interested in nothing that came under his eye , and at last he presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer had come yet .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 35]: The boy said , `` No , no answer yet , '' then glanced at the clock and added , `` I do n't think it 's likely you 'll get one to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 11]: `` Well , you see it 's getting pretty late .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 55]: You ca n't always tell where ` bouts a man is when he 's on the other side , and you ca n't always find him just the minute you want him , and you see it 's getting about six o'clock now , and over there it 's pretty late at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 17]: `` Why yes , '' said Tracy , `` I had n't thought of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 14]: `` Yes , pretty late , now , half past ten or eleven .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 13]: Oh yes , you probably wo n't get any answer to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 7]: So Tracy went home to supper .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 35]: The odors in that supper room seemed more strenuous and more horrible than ever before , and he was happy in the thought that he was so soon to be free from them again .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 29]: When the supper was over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not , and he certainly had n't heard any of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 40]: His heart had been dancing all the time , his thoughts had been faraway from these things , and in the visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his father 's castle had risen before him without rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 22]: Even the plushed flunkey , that walking symbol of a sham inequality , had not been unpleasant to his dreaming view .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 11]: After the meal Barrow said , `` Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: I 'll give you a jolly evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 6]: Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: `` To my club . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 7]: `` What club is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: `` Mechanics ' Debating Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 5]: Tracy shuddered , slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 12]: He did n't say anything about having visited that place himself .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 12]: Somehow he did n't quite relish the memory of that time .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 48]: The sentiments which had made his former visit there so enjoyable , and filled him with such enthusiasm , had undergone a gradual change , and they had rotted away to such a degree that he could n't contemplate another visit there with anything strongly resembling delight .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 44]: In fact he was a little ashamed to go ; he did n't want to go there and find out by the rude impact of the thought of those people upon his reorganized condition of mind , how sharp the change had been .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 8]: He would have preferred to stay away .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 32]: He expected that now he should hear nothing except sentiments which would be a reproach to him in his changed mental attitude , and he rather wished he might be excused .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 51]: And yet he did n't quite want to say that , he did n't want to show how he did feel , or show any disinclination to go , and so he forced himself to go along with Barrow , privately purposing to take an early opportunity to get away .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 34]: After the essayist of the evening had read his paper , the chairman announced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous meeting , `` The American Press . ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 10]: It saddened the backsliding disciple to hear this announcement .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 7]: It brought up too many reminiscences .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 10]: He wished he had happened upon some other subject .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 12]: But the debate began , and he sat still and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 35]: In the course of the discussion one of the speakers -- a blacksmith named Tompkins -- arraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for their cold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 35]: He said that no monarch and no son of a monarch , no lord and no son of a lord ought to be able to look his fellow man in the face without shame .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 53]: Shame for consenting to keep his unearned titles , property , and privileges -- at the expense of other people ; shame for consenting to remain , on any terms , in dishonourable possession of these things , which represented bygone robberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 39]: He said , `` if there were a laid or the son of a lord here , I would like to reason with him , and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his position is .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 52]: I would try to persuade him to relinquish it , take his place among men on equal terms , earn the bread he eats , and hold of slight value all deference paid him because of artificial position , all reverence not the just due of his own personal merits . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 20]: Tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks with his radical friends in England .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 32]: It was as if some eavesdropping phonograph had treasured up his words and brought them across the Atlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his defection and retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 35]: Every word spoken by this stranger seemed to leave a blister on Tracy 's conscience , and by the time the speech was finished he felt that he was all conscience and one blister .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 48]: This man 's deep compassion for the enslaved and oppressed millions in Europe who had to bear with the contempt of that small class above them , throned upon shining heights whose paths were shut against them , was the very thing he had often uttered himself .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 38]: The pity in this man 's voice and words was the very twin of the pity that used to reside in his own heart and come from his own lips when he thought of these oppressed peoples .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 9]: The homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 11]: It was a silence most grateful to Tracy 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 23]: He would n't have broken it for anything ; for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his spine .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 17]: He kept saying to himself : `` How unanswerable it all is -- how absolutely unanswerable !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 38]: It is basely , degradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors , and -- and -- oh , hang it , nobody but a cur -- '' `` What an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins made ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 6]: This outburst was from Barrow .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: It flooded Tracy 's demoralized soul with waters of refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 43]: These were the darlingest words the poor vacillating young apostate had ever heard -- for they whitewashed his shame for him , and that is a good service to have when you ca n't get the best of all verdicts , self-acquittal .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 14]: `` Come up to my room and smoke a pipe , Tracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 25]: Tracy had been expecting this invitation , and had had his declination all ready : but he was glad enough to accept , now .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 17]: Was it possible that a reasonable argument could be made against that man 's desolating speech ?
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 9]: He was burning to hear Barrow try it .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 28]: He knew how to start him , and keep him going : it was to seem to combat his positions -- a process effective with most people .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 15]: `` What is it you object to in Tompkins 's speech , Barrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 26]: `` Oh , the leaving out of the factor of human nature ; requiring another man to do what you would n't do yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 19]: `` Do you mean -- '' `` Why here 's what I mean ; it 's very simple .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 26]: Tompkins is a blacksmith ; has a family ; works for wages ; and hard , too -- fooling around wo n't furnish the bread .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 28]: Suppose it should turn out that by the death of somebody in England he is suddenly an earl -- income , half a million dollars a year .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: What would he do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 27]: `` Well , I -- I suppose he would have to decline to -- '' `` Man , he would grab it in a second ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 9]: `` Do you really think he would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 3]: `` Think ?
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: -- I do n't think anything about it , I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 9]: `` Because he 's not a fool . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 21]: `` So you think that if he were a fool , he -- '' `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: Fool or no fool , he would grab it .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 3]: Anybody would .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 5]: Anybody that 's alive .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 15]: And I 've seen dead people that would get up and go for it .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: I would myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 18]: `` This was balm , this was healing , this was rest and peace and comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 11]: `` But I thought you were opposed to nobilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 6]: `` Transmissible ones , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 5]: But that 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 18]: I 'm opposed to millionaires , but it would be dangerous to offer me the position . ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: `` You 'd take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 20]: `` I would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its burdens and responsibilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 23]: Tracy thought a while , then said : `` I do n't know that I quite get the bearings of your position .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 24]: You say you are opposed to hereditary nobilities , and yet if you had the chance you would -- '' `` Take one ?
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 6]: In a minute I would .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 14]: And there is n't a mechanic in that entire club that would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 40]: There is n't a lawyer , doctor , editor , author , tinker , loafer , railroad president , saint-land , there is n't a human being in the United States that would n't jump at the chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 9]: `` Except me , '' said Tracy softly .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 5]: `` Except you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 14]: Barrow could hardly get the words out , his scorn so choked him .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 22]: And he could n't get any further than that form of words ; it seemed to dam his flow , utterly .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 27]: He got up and came and glared upon Tracy in a kind of outraged and unappeasable way , and said again , `` Except you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 35]: He walked around him -- inspecting him from one point of view and then another , and relieving his soul now and then by exploding that formula at him ; `` Except you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 68]: Finally he slumped down into his chair with the air of one who gives it up , and said : `` He 's straining his viscera and he 's breaking his heart trying to get some low-down job that a good dog would n't have , and yet wants to let on that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he would n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 13]: Tracy , do n't put this kind of a strain on me .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 11]: Lately I 'm not as strong as I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 53]: `` Well , I was n't meaning to put -- a strain on you , Barrow , I was only meaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way -- '' `` There -- I would n't give myself any worry about that , if I was you .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 11]: And besides , I can settle what you would do .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 8]: Are you any different from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 6]: `` Well -- no . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 9]: `` Are you any better than me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 12]: `` O , -- er -- why , certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 6]: `` Are you as good ?
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 18]: `` Indeed , I -- the fact is you take me so suddenly -- '' `` Suddenly ?
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 7]: What is there sudden about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: It is n't a difficult question is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 3]: Or doubtful ?
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 135]: Just measure us on the only fair lines -- the lines of merit -- and of course you 'll admit that a journeyman chairmaker that earns his twenty dollars a week , and has had the good and genuine culture of contact with men , and care , and hardship , and failure , and success , and downs and ups and ups and downs , is just a trifle the superior of a young fellow like you , who does n't know how to do anything that 's valuable , ca n't earn his living in any secure and steady way , has n't had any experience of life and its seriousness , has n't any culture but the artificial culture of books , which adorns but does n't really educate -- come !
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 19]: if I would n't scorn an earldom , what the devil right have you to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 17]: Tracy dissembled his joy , though he wanted to thank the chair-maker for that last remark .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 39]: Presently a thought struck him , and he spoke up briskly and said : `` But look here , I really ca n't quite get the hang of your notions -- your principles , if they are principles .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 4]: You are inconsistent .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 16]: You are opposed to aristocracies , yet you 'd take an earldom if you could .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 19]: Am I to understand that you do n't blame an earl for being and remaining an earl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 7]: `` I certainly do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 27]: `` And you would n't blame Tompkins , or yourself , or me , or anybody , for accepting an earldom if it was offered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 7]: `` Indeed I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 11]: `` Well , then , who would you blame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 49]: `` The whole nation -- any bulk and mass of population anywhere , in any country , that will put up with the infamy , the outrage , the insult of a hereditary aristocracy which they ca n't enter -- and on absolutely free and equal terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 16]: `` Come , are n't you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not differences ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 6]: `` Indeed I am not .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 8]: I am entirely clear-headed about this thing .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 22]: If I could extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors , then I should be a rascal to accept them .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 31]: And if enough of the mass would join me to make the extirpation possible , then I should be a rascal to do otherwise than help in the attempt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 15]: `` I believe I understand -- yes , I think I get the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 40]: You have no blame for the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest they were born into , you only despise the all-powerful and stupid mass of the nation for allowing the nest to exist . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 9]: `` That 's it , that 's it !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 18]: You can get a simple thing through your head if you work at it long enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 4]: `` Thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 6]: `` Do n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 62]: And I 'll give you some sound advice : when you go back ; if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary affront , lend a hand ; but if that is n't the state of things and you get a chance at an earldom , do n't you be a fool -- you take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 18]: Tracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm : `` As I live , I 'll do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 3]: Barrow laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 8]: `` I never saw such a fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 13]: I begin to think you 've got a good deal of imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 13]: With you , the idlest-fancy freezes into a reality at a breath .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 23]: Why , you looked , then , as if it would n't astonish you if you did tumble into an earldom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 3]: Tracy blushed .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 6]: Barrow added : `` Earldom !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 62]: Oh , yes , take it , if it offers ; but meantime we 'll go on looking around , in a modest way , and if you get a chance to superintend a sausage-stuffer at six or eight dollars a week , you just trade off the earldom for a last year 's almanac and stick to the sausage-stuffing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 16]: Tracy went to bed happy once more , at rest in his mind once more .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 52]: He had started out on a high emprise -- that was to his credit , he argued ; he had fought the best fight he could , considering the odds against him -- that was to his credit ; he had been defeated -- certainly there was nothing discreditable in that .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 34]: Being defeated , he had a right to retire with the honors of war and go back without prejudice to the position in the world 's society to which he had been born .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 9]: even the rabid republican chair-maker would do that .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: Yes , his conscience was comfortable once more .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 12]: He woke refreshed , happy , and eager for his cablegram .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 23]: He had been born an aristocrat , he had been a democrat for a time , he was now an aristocrat again .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 47]: He marveled to find that this final change was not merely intellectual , it had invaded his feeling ; and he also marveled to note that this feeling seemed a good deal less artificial than any he had entertained in his system for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 32]: He could also have noted , if he had thought of it , that his bearing had stiffened , over night , and that his chin had lifted itself a shade .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 37]: Arrived in the basement , he was about to enter the breakfast room when he saw old Marsh in the dim light of a corner of the hall , beckoning him with his finger to approach .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 29]: The blood welled slowly up in Tracy 's cheek , and he said with a grade of injured dignity almost ducal : `` Is that for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 9]: `` What is the purpose of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 12]: `` I want to speak to you -- in private . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 10]: `` This spot is private enough for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 9]: Marsh was surprised ; and not particularly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 17]: He approached and said : `` Oh , in public , then , if you prefer .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 9]: Though it has n't been my way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 9]: The boarders gathered to the spot , interested .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 8]: `` Speak out , '' said Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: `` What is it you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 13]: `` Well , have n't you -- er -- forgot something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 8]: I 'm not aware of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 7]: `` Oh , you 're not ?
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 10]: Now you stop and think , a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 8]: `` I refuse to stop and think .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 6]: It does n't interest me .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 9]: If it interests you , speak out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 37]: `` Well , then , '' said Marsh , raising his voice to a slightly angry pitch , `` You forgot to pay your board yesterday -- if you 're bound to have it public . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 28]: Oh , yes , this heir to an annual million or so had been dreaming and soaring , and had forgotten that pitiful three or four dollars .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 34]: For penalty he must have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of these people -- people in whose countenances was already beginning to dawn an uncharitable enjoyment of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 5]: `` Is that all !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 11]: Take your money and give your terrors a rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 12]: Tracy 's hand went down into his pocket with angry decision .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 8]: But -- it did n't come out .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 10]: The color began to ebb out of his face .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 17]: The countenances about him showed a growing interest ; and some of them a heightened satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 25]: There was an uncomfortable pause -- then he forced out , with difficulty , the words : `` I 've -- been robbed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 20]: Old Marsh 's eyes flamed up with Spanish fire , and he exclaimed : `` Robbed , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 5]: That 's your tune ?
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 36]: It 's too old -- been played in this house too often ; everybody plays it that ca n't get work when he wants it , and wo n't work when he can get it .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 16]: Trot out Mr. Allen , somebody , and let him take a toot at it .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 14]: It 's his turn next , he forgot , too , last night .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 7]: I 'm laying for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 31]: One of the negro women came scrambling down stairs as pale as a sorrel horse with consternation and excitement : `` Misto Marsh , Misto Allen 's skipped out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 18]: `` Yes-sah , and cleaned out his room clean ; tuck bofe towels en de soap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 8]: `` You lie , you hussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 30]: `` It 's jes ' so , jes ' as I tells you -- en Misto Summer 's socks is gone , en Misto Naylor 's yuther shirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 10]: Mr. Marsh was at boiling point by this time .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 18]: He turned upon Tracy : `` Answer up now -- when are you going to settle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 13]: `` To-day -- since you seem to be in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 5]: `` To-day is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 8]: Sunday -- and you out of work ?
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: I like that .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 12]: Come -- where are you going to get the money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 7]: Tracy 's spirit was rising again .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 17]: He proposed to impress these people : `` I am expecting a cablegram from home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 12]: Old Marsh was caught out , with the surprise of it .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 19]: The idea was so immense , so extravagant , that he could n't get his breath at first .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 12]: When he did get it , it came rancid with sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 18]: `` A cablegram -- think of it , ladies and gents , he 's expecting a cablegram !
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 15]: He 's expecting a cablegram -- this duffer , this scrub , this bilk !
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 6]: From his father -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: Yes -- without a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 30]: A dollar or two a word -- oh , that 's nothing -- they do n't mind a little thing like that -- this kind 's fathers do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 24]: Now his father is -- er -- well , I reckon his father -- '' `` My father is an English earl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 17]: The crowd fell back aghast-aghast at the sublimity of the young loafer 's `` cheek . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 12]: Then they burst into a laugh that made the windows rattle .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 14]: Tracy was too angry to realize that he had done a foolish thing .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 9]: He said : `` Stand aside , please .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 26]: I -- '' `` Wait a minute , your lordship , '' said Marsh , bowing low , `` where is your lordship going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 5]: `` For the cablegram .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 5]: Let me pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 16]: `` Excuse me , your lordship , you 'll stay right where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: `` I mean that I did n't begin to keep boarding-house yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 33]: It means that I am not the kind that can be taken in by every hack-driver 's son that comes loafing over here because he ca n't bum a living at home .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 41]: It means that you ca n't skip out on any such -- '' Tracy made a step toward the old man , but Mrs. Marsh sprang between , and said : `` Do n't , Mr. Tracy , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 14]: She turned to her husband and said , `` Do bridle your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 9]: What has he done to be treated so ?
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 15]: Ca n't you see he has lost his mind , with trouble and distress ?
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 6]: He 's not responsible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 44]: `` Thank your kind heart , madam , but I 've not lost my mind ; and if I can have the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office -- '' `` Well , you ca n't , '' cried Marsh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 8]: -- or sending -- '' `` Sending !
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 4]: That beats everything .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 29]: If there 's anybody that 's fool enough to go on such a chuckle-headed errand -- '' `` Here comes Mr. Barrow -- he will go for me .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 23]: Barrow -- '' A brisk fire of exclamations broke out -- `` Say , Barrow , he 's expecting a cablegram ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 10]: `` Cablegram from his father , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 9]: `` Yes -- cablegram from the wax-figger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 23]: `` And say , Barrow , this fellow 's an earl -- take off your hat , pull down your vest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 17]: `` Yes , he 's come off and forgot his crown , that he wears Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 12]: He 's cabled over to his pappy to send it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 20]: `` You step out and get that cablegram , Barrow ; his majesty 's a little lame to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 16]: `` Oh stop , '' cried Barrow ; `` give the man a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 19]: He turned , and said with some severity , `` Tracy , what 's the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 11]: What kind of foolishness is this you 've been talking .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 8]: You ought to have more sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 27]: `` I 've not been talking foolishness ; and if you 'll go to the telegraph office -- '' `` Oh ; do n't talk so .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 53]: I 'm your friend in trouble and out of it , before your face and behind your back , for anything in reason ; but you 've lost your head , you see , and this moonshine about a cablegram -- '' `` I 'll go there and ask for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 12]: `` Thank you from the bottom of my heart , Brady .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 12]: Here , I 'll give you a Written order for it .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 8]: Fly , now , and fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 6]: We 'll soon see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 3]: Brady flew .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 61]: Immediately the sort of quiet began to steal over the crowd which means dawning doubt , misgiving ; and might be translated into the words , `` Maybe he is expecting a cablegram -- maybe he has got a father somewhere -- maybe we 've been just a little too fresh , just a shade too ` previous ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 15]: Loud talk ceased ; then the mutterings and low murmurings and whisperings died out .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 7]: The crowd began to crumble apart .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 12]: By ones and twos the fragments drifted to the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 20]: Barrow tried to bring Tracy in ; but he said : `` Not yet , Barrow -- presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 27]: Mrs. Marsh and Hattie tried , offering gentle and kindly persuasions ; but he said ; `` I would rather wait -- till he comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 60]: Even old Marsh began to have suspicions that maybe he had been a trifle too `` brash , '' as he called it in the privacy of his soul , and he pulled himself together and started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes ; but Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 22]: Then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever been known in that house at that time of day .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 56]: It was so still , and so solemn withal , that when somebody 's cup slipped from his fingers and landed in his plate the shock made people start , and the sharp sound seemed as indecorous there and as out of place as if a coffin and mourners were imminent and being waited for .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 17]: And at last when Brady 's feet came clattering down the stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 31]: Everybody rose softly and turned toward the door , where stood Tracy ; then with a common impulse , moved a step or two in that direction , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 24]: While they gazed , young Brady arrived , panting , and put into Tracy 's hand , -- sure enough -- an envelope .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 27]: Tracy fastened a bland victorious eye upon the gazers , and kept it there till one by one they dropped their eyes , vanquished and embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 12]: Then he tore open the telegram and glanced at its message .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 19]: The yellow paper fell from his fingers and fluttered to the floor , and his face turned white .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: There was nothing there but one word -- `` Thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 28]: The humorist of the house , the tall , raw-boned Billy Nash , caulker from the navy yard , was standing in the rear of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 67]: In the midst of the pathetic silence that was now brooding over the place and moving some few hearts there toward compassion , he began to whimper , then he put his handkerchief to his eyes and buried his face in the neck of the bashfulest young fellow in the company , a navy-yard blacksmith , shrieked `` Oh , pappy , how could you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 26]: and began to bawl like a teething baby , if one may imagine a baby with the energy and the devastating voice of a jackass .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 56]: So perfect was that imitation of a child 's cry , and so vast the scale of it and so ridiculous the aspect of the performer , that all gravity was swept from the place as if by a hurricane , and almost everybody there joined in the crash of laughter provoked by the exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 33]: Then the small mob began to take its revenge -- revenge for the discomfort and apprehension it had brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness of a little while before .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 20]: It guyed its poor victim , baited him , worried him , as dogs do with a cornered cat .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 60]: The victim answered back with defiances and challenges which included everybody , and which only gave the sport new spirit and variety ; but when he changed his tactics and began to single out individuals and invite them by name , the fun lost its funniness and the interest of the show died out , along with the noise .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 23]: Finally Marsh was about to take an innings , but Barrow said : `` Never mind , now -- leave him alone .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 11]: You 've no account with him but a money account .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 9]: I 'll take care of that myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 88]: The distressed and worried landlady gave Barrow a fervently grateful look for his championship of the abused stranger ; and the pet of the house , a very prism in her cheap but ravishing Sunday rig , blew him a kiss from the tips of her fingers and said , with the darlingest smile and a sweet little toss of her head : `` You 're the only man here , and I 'm going to set my cap for you , you dear old thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 6]: `` For shame , Puss !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 4]: How you talk !
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 8]: I never saw such a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 31]: It took a good deal of argument and persuasion -- that is to say , petting , under these disguises -- to get Tracy to entertain the idea of breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 45]: He at first said he would never eat again in that house ; and added that he had enough firmness of character , he trusted , to enable him to starve like a man when the alternative was to eat insult with his bread .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 48]: When he had finished his breakfast , Barrow took him to his room , furnished him a pipe , and said cheerily : `` Now , old fellow , take in your battle-flag out of the wet , you 're not in the hostile camp any more .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 85]: You 're a little upset by your troubles , and that 's natural enough , but do n't let your mind run on them anymore than you can help ; drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the ears , by the heels , or any other way , so you manage it ; it 's the healthiest thing a body can do ; dwelling on troubles is deadly , just deadly -- and that 's the softest name there is for it .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 13]: You must keep your mind amused -- you must , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 7]: `` Oh , miserable me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: There 's just pure heart-break in that tone .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 28]: It 's just as I say ; you 've got to get right down to it and amuse your mind , as if it was salvation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 43]: `` They 're easy words to say , Barrow , but how am I going to amuse , entertain , divert a mind that finds itself suddenly assaulted and overwhelmed by disasters of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for ?
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 24]: No -- no , the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings : Let us talk of death and funerals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 6]: `` No -- not yet .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 8]: That would be giving up the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 9]: We 'll not give up the ship yet .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 20]: I 'm going to amuse you ; I sent Brady out for the wherewithal before you finished breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 4]: `` You did ?
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 11]: `` Come , this is a good sign -- curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: Oh , there 's hope for you yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 32]: Brady arrived with a box , and departed , after saying , `` They 're finishing one up , but they 'll be along as soon as it 's done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 38]: Barrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square from the box , set it up in a good light , without comment , and reached for another , taking a furtive glance at Tracy , meantime .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 20]: The stony solemnity in Tracy 's face remained as it was , and gave out no sign of interest .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 19]: Barrow placed the second portrait beside the first , and stole another glance while reaching for a third .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 8]: The stone image softened , a shade .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 40]: No. 3 forced the ghost of a smile , No. 4 swept indifference wholly away , and No. 5 started a laugh which was still in good and hearty condition when No. 14 took its place in the row .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 14]: `` Oh , you 're all right , yet , '' said Barrow .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 10]: `` You see you 're not past amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 50]: The pictures were fearful , as to color , and atrocious as to drawing and expression ; but the feature which squelched animosity and made them funny was a feature which could not achieve its full force in a single picture , but required the wonder-working assistance of repetition .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 67]: One loudly dressed mechanic in stately attitude , with his hand on a cannon , ashore , and a ship riding at anchor in the offing , -- this is merely odd ; but when one sees the same cannon and the same ship in fourteen pictures in a row , and a different mechanic standing watch in each , the thing gets to be funny .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 11]: `` Explain -- explain these aberrations , '' said Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 25]: `` Well , they are not the achievement of a single intellect , a single talent -- it takes two to do these miracles .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 16]: They are collaborations ; the one artist does the figure , the other the accessories .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 40]: The figure-artist is a German shoemaker with an untaught passion for art , the other is a simple hearted old Yankee sailor-man whose possibilities are strictly limited to his ship , his cannon and his patch of petrified sea .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 42]: They work these things up from twenty-five-cent tintypes ; they get six dollars apiece for them , and they can grind out a couple a day when they strike what they call a boost -- that is , an inspiration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 10]: `` People actually pay money for these calumnies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 11]: `` They actually do -- and quite willingly , too .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 36]: And these abortionists could double their trade and work the women in , if Capt. Saltmarsh could whirl a horse in , or a piano , or a guitar , in place of his cannon .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 12]: The fact is , he fatigues the market with that cannon .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 8]: Even the male market , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 10]: These fourteen in the procession are not all satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 46]: One is an old ` independent ' fireman , and he wants an engine in place of the cannon ; another is a mate of a tug , and wants a tug in place of the ship -- and so on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 24]: But the captain ca n't make a tug that is deceptive , and a fire engine is many flights beyond his power . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 19]: `` This is a most extraordinary form of robbery , I never have heard of anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 5]: It 's interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 9]: `` Yes , and so are the artists .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 9]: They are perfectly honest men , and sincere .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 29]: And the old sailor-man is full of sound religion , and is as devoted a student of the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 25]: I do n't know a better man or kinder hearted old soul than Saltmarsh , although he does swear a little , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 7]: `` He seems to be perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: I want to know him , Barrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: `` You 'll have the chance .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 9]: I guess I hear them coming , now .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 14]: We 'll draw them out on their art , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 10]: The artists arrived and shook hands with great heartiness .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 22]: The German was forty and a little fleshy , with a shiny bald head and a kindly face and deferential manner .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 41]: Capt. Saltmarsh was sixty , tall , erect , powerfully built , with coal-black hair and whiskers , and he had a well tanned complexion , and a gait and countenance that were full of command , confidence and decision .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 24]: His horny hands and wrists were covered with tattoo-marks , and when his lips parted , his teeth showed up white and blemishless .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 25]: His voice was the effortless deep bass of a church organ , and would disturb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty yards away .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 10]: `` They 're wonderful pictures , '' said Barrow .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 8]: `` We 've been examining them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 20]: `` It is very bleasant dot you like dem , '' said Handel , the German , greatly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 18]: `` Und you , Herr Tracy , you haf peen bleased mit dem too , alretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 16]: `` I can honestly say I have never seen anything just like them before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 4]: `` Schon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: cried the German , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 6]: `` You hear , Gaptain ?
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: Here is a chentleman , yes , vot abbreviate unser aart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 40]: The captain was charmed , and said : `` Well , sir , we 're thankful for a compliment yet , though they 're not as scarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 15]: `` Getting the reputation is the up-hill time in most things , captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 5]: `` It 's so .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 23]: It ai n't enough to know how to reef a gasket , you got to make the mate know you know it .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 4]: That 's reputation .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 32]: The good word , said at the right time , that 's the word that makes us ; and evil be to him that evil thinks , as Isaiah says . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 16]: `` It 's very relevant , and hits the point exactly , '' said Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 10]: `` Where did you study art , Captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 13]: `` I have n't studied ; it 's a natural gift . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 10]: `` He is born mit dose cannon in him .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 14]: He tondt haf to do noding , his chenius do all de vork .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 18]: Of he is asleep , and take a pencil in his hand , out come a cannon .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 38]: Py crashus , of he could do a clavier , of he could do a guitar , of he could do a vashtub , it is a fortune , heiliger Yohanniss it is yoost a fortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 21]: `` Well , it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited in this unfortunate way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 20]: The captain grew a trifle excited , himself , now : `` You 've said it , Mr. Tracy !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 3]: -- Hindered ?
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 7]: well , I should say so .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 5]: Why , look here .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 21]: This fellow here , No. 11 , he 's a hackman , -- a flourishing hackman , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 8]: He wants his hack in this picture .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 7]: Wants it where the cannon is .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 62]: I got around that difficulty , by telling him the cannon 's our trademark , so to speak -- proves that the picture 's our work , and I was afraid if we left it out people would n't know for certain if it was a Saltmarsh -- Handel -- now you would n't yourself -- '' `` What , Captain ?
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 8]: You wrong yourself , indeed you do .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 14]: Anyone who has once seen a genuine Saltmarsh-Handel is safe from imposture forever .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 46]: Strip it , flay it , skin it out of every detail but the bare color and expression , and that man will still recognize it -- still stop to worship -- '' `` Oh , how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpressions !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 56]: -- '' -- `` still say to himself again as he had , said a hundred times before , the art of the Saltmarsh-Handel is an art apart , there is nothing in the heavens above or in the earth beneath that resembles it , -- '' `` Py chiminy , nur horen Sie einmal !
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 13]: In my life day haf I never heard so brecious worts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 52]: `` So I talked him out of the hack , Mr. Tracy , and he let up on that , and said put in a hearse , then -- because he 's chief mate of a hearse but do n't own it -- stands a watch for wages , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 25]: But I ca n't do a hearse any more than I can a hack ; so here we are -- becalmed , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 10]: And it 's the same with women and such .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 25]: They come and they want a little johnry picture -- '' `` It 's the accessories that make it a ` genre ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 24]: `` Yes -- cannon , or cat , or any little thing like that , that you heave into whoop up the effect .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 28]: We could do a prodigious trade with the women if we could foreground the things they like , but they do n't give a damn for artillery .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 35]: Mine 's the lack , '' continued the captain with a sigh , `` Andy 's end of the business is all right I tell you he 's an artist from way back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 7]: `` Yoost hear dot old man !
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 15]: He always talk ` poud me like dot , '' purred the pleased German .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 7]: `` Look at his work yourself !
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: Fourteen portraits in a row .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 8]: And no two of them alike . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 19]: `` Now that you speak of it , it is true ; I had n't noticed it before .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 5]: It is very remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: Unique , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 6]: `` I should say so .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 11]: That 's the very thing about Andy -- he discriminates .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 31]: Discrimination 's the thief of time -- forty-ninth Psalm ; but that ai n't any matter , it 's the honest thing , and it pays in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 43]: `` Yes , he certainly is great in that feature , one is obliged to admit it ; but -- now mind , I 'm not really criticising -- do n't you think he is just a trifle overstrong in technique ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 11]: The captain 's face was knocked expressionless by this remark .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 31]: It remained quite vacant while he muttered to himself -- `` Technique -- technique -- polytechnique -- pyro-technique ; that 's it , likely -- fireworks too much color . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 45]: Then he spoke up with serenity and confidence , and said : `` Well , yes , he does pile it on pretty loud ; but they all like it , you know -- fact is , it 's the life of the business .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 11]: Take that No. 9 , there , Evans the butcher .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 18]: He drops into the stoodio as sober-colored as anything you ever see : now look at him .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: You ca n't tell him from scarlet fever .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 9]: Well , it pleases that butcher to death .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 38]: I 'm making a study of a sausage-wreath to hang on the cannon , and I do n't really reckon I can do it right , but if I can , we can break the butcher . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 24]: `` Unquestionably your confederate -- I mean your -- your fellow-craftsman -- is a great colorist -- '' `` Oh , danke schon !
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 75]: -- '' -- `` in fact a quite extraordinary colorist ; a colorist , I make bold to say , without imitator here or abroad -- and with a most bold and effective touch , a touch like a battering ram ; and a manner so peculiar and romantic , and extraneous , and ad libitum , and heart-searching , that -- that -- he -- he is an impressionist , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 16]: `` No , '' said the captain simply , `` he is a Presbyterian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 64]: `` It accounts for it all -- all -- there 's something divine about his art , -- soulful , unsatisfactory , yearning , dim hearkening on the void horizon , vague -- murmuring to the spirit out of ultra-marine distances and far-sounding cataclysms of uncreated space -- oh , if he -- if , he -- has he ever tried distemper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 14]: The captain answered up with energy : `` Not if he knows himself !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 20]: But his dog has , and -- '' `` Oh , no , it vas not my dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 11]: `` Why , you said it was your dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 43]: `` Oh , no , gaptain , I -- '' `` It was a white dog , was n't it , with his tail docked , and one ear gone , and -- '' `` Dot 's him , dot 's him !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 5]: -- der fery dog .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 37]: Wy , py Chorge , dot dog he would eat baint yoost de same like -- '' `` Well , never mind that , now -- ` vast heaving -- I never saw such a man .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 13]: You start him on that dog and he 'll dispute a year .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 19]: Blamed if I have n't seen him keep it up a level two hours and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 5]: `` Why captain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 3]: said Barrow .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 9]: `` I guess that must be hearsay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 16]: `` No , sir , no hearsay about it -- he disputed with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 11]: `` I do n't see how you stood it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 14]: `` Oh , you 've got to -- if you run with Andy .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 11]: But it 's the only fault he 's got . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: `` Ai n't you afraid of acquiring it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 22]: `` Oh , no , '' said the captain , tranquilly , `` no danger of that , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 7]: The artists presently took their leave .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 22]: Then Barrow put his hands on Tracy 's shoulders and said : `` Look me in the eye , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 4]: Steady , steady .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 21]: There -- it 's just as I thought -- hoped , anyway ; you 're all right , thank goodness .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 7]: Nothing the matter with your mind .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 11]: But do n't do that again -- even for fun .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 5]: It is n't wise .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 15]: They would n't have believed you if you 'd been an earl 's son .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 12]: Why , they could n't -- do n't you know that ?
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 10]: What ever possessed you to take such a freak ?
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 13]: But never mind about that ; let 's not talk of it .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 11]: It was a mistake ; you see that yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 9]: `` Yes -- it was a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 21]: `` Well , just drop it out of your mind ; it 's no harm ; we all make them .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 16]: Pull your courage together , and do n't brood , and do n't give up .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 19]: I 'm at your back , and we 'll pull through , do n't you be afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 18]: When he was gone , Barrow walked the floor a good while , uneasy in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 12]: He said to himself , `` I 'm troubled about him .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 20]: He never would have made a break like that if he had n't been a little off his balance .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 18]: But I know what being out of work and no prospect ahead can do for a man .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 27]: First it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt ; worry does the rest , and his mind gets shaky .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 7]: I must talk to these people .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 33]: No -- if there 's any humanity in them -- and there is , at bottom -- they 'll be easier on him if they think his troubles have disturbed his reason .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 19]: But I 've got to find him some work ; work 's the only medicine for his disease .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 3]: Poor devil !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 10]: away off here , and not a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 24]: CHAPTER XVII The moment Tracy was alone his spirits vanished away , and all the misery of his situation was manifest to him .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 56]: To be moneyless and an object of the chairmaker 's charity -- this was bad enough , but his folly in proclaiming himself an earl 's son to that scoffing and unbelieving crew , and , on top of that , the humiliating result -- the recollection of these things was a sharper torture still .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 19]: He made up his mind that he would never play earl 's son again before a doubtful audience .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 12]: His father 's answer was a blow he could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 41]: At times he thought his father imagined he could get work to do in America without any trouble , and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of his radicalism by hard , cold , disenchanting experience .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 16]: That seemed the most plausible theory , yet he could not content himself with it .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 28]: A theory that pleased him better was , that this cablegram would be followed by another , of a gentler sort , requiring him to come home .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 15]: Should he write and strike his flag , and ask for a ticket home ?
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 11]: Oh , no , that he could n't ever do .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 6]: At least , not yet .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 9]: That cablegram would come , it certainly would .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 27]: So he went from one telegraph office to another every day for nearly a week , and asked if there was a cablegram for Howard Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 7]: No , there was n't any .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 7]: So they answered him at first .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 13]: Later , they said it before he had a chance to ask .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 16]: Later still they merely shook their heads impatiently as soon as he came in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 10]: After that he was ashamed to go any more .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 31]: He was down in the lowest depths of despair , now ; for the harder Barrow tried to find work for him the more hopeless the possibilities seemed to grow .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 11]: At last he said to Barrow : `` Look here .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 7]: I want to make a confession .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 39]: I have got down , now , to where I am not only willing to acknowledge to myself that I am a shabby creature and full of false pride , but am willing to acknowledge it to you .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 29]: Well , I 've been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work for me when there 's been a chance open to me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 10]: Forgive my pride -- what was left of it .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 37]: It is all gone , now , and I 've come to confess that if those ghastly artists want another confederate , I 'm their man -- for at last I am dead to shame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 7]: Really , can you paint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 7]: `` Not as badly as they .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 45]: No , I do n't claim that , for I am not a genius ; in fact , I am a very indifferent amateur , a slouchy dabster , a mere artistic sarcasm ; but drunk or asleep I can beat those buccaneers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 3]: `` Shake !
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 5]: I want to shout !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 13]: Oh , I tell you , I am immensely delighted and relieved .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 10]: Oh , just to work -- that is life !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 13]: No matter what the work is -- that 's of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 14]: Just work itself is bliss when a man 's been starving for it .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 5]: I 've been there !
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 12]: Come right along ; we 'll hunt the old boys up .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: Do n't you feel good ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 7]: I tell you I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 7]: The freebooters were not at home .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 17]: But their `` works '' were , displayed in profusion all about the little ratty studio .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 24]: Cannon to the right of them , cannon to the left of them , cannon in front -- it was Balaclava come again .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 9]: `` Here 's the uncontented hackman , Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 16]: Buckle to -- deepen the sea-green to turf , turn the ship into a hearse .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 11]: Let the boys have a taste of your quality . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 12]: The artists arrived just as the last touch was put on .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 6]: They stood transfixed with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 12]: `` My souls but she 's a stunner , that hearse !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 18]: The hackman will just go all to pieces when he sees that wo n't he Andy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 9]: `` Oh , it is sphlennid , sphlennid !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 15]: Herr Tracy , why haf you not said you vas a so sublime aartist ?
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 26]: Lob ' Gott , of you had lif 'd in Paris you would be a Pree de Rome , dot 's votes de matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 6]: The arrangements were soon made .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 33]: Tracy was taken into full and equal partnership , and he went straight to work , with dash and energy , to reconstructing gems of art whose accessories had failed to satisfy .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 78]: Under his hand , on that and succeeding days , artillery disappeared and the emblems of peace and commerce took its place -- cats , hacks , sausages , tugs , fire engines , pianos , guitars , rocks , gardens , flower-pots , landscapes -- whatever was wanted , he flung it in ; and the more out of place and absurd the required object was , the more joy he got out of fabricating it .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 24]: The pirates were delighted , the customers applauded , the sex began to flock in , great was the prosperity of the firm .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 56]: Tracy was obliged to confess to himself that there was something about work , -- even such grotesque and humble work as this -- which most pleasantly satisfied a something in his nature which had never been satisfied before , and also gave him a strange new dignity in his own private view of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 19]: ... ... ... ... ... The Unqualified Member from Cherokee Strip was in a state of deep dejection .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 36]: For a good while , now , he had been leading a sort of life which was calculated to kill ; for it had consisted in regularly alternating days of brilliant hope and black disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 39]: The brilliant hopes were created by the magician Sellers , and they always promised that now he had got the trick , sure , and would effectively influence that materialized cowboy to call at the Towers before night .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 14]: The black disappointments consisted in the persistent and monotonous failure of these prophecies .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 33]: At the date which this history has now reached , Sellers was appalled to find that the usual remedy was inoperative , and that Hawkins 's low spirits refused absolutely to lift .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 32]: Something must be done , he reflected ; it was heart-breaking , this woe , this smileless misery , this dull despair that looked out from his poor friend 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 8]: Yes , he must be cheered up .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 11]: He mused a while , then he saw his way .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 47]: He said in his most conspicuously casual vein : `` Er -- uh -- by the way , Hawkins , we are feeling disappointed about this thing -- the way the materializee is acting , I mean -- we are disappointed ; you concede that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 4]: `` Concede it ?
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 11]: Why , yes , if you like the term . ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 10]: `` Very well ; so far , so good .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 8]: Now for the basis of the feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 27]: It is not that your heart , your affections are concerned ; that is to say , it is not that you want the materializee Itself .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: You concede that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 12]: `` Yes , I concede that , too -- cordially . ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 11]: `` Very well , again ; we are making progress .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 42]: To sum up : The feeling , it is conceded , is not engendered by the mere conduct of the materializee ; it is conceded that it does not arise from any pang which the personality of the materializee could assuage .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 40]: Now then , '' said the earl , with the light of triumph in his eye , `` the inexorable logic of the situation narrows us down to this : our feeling has its source in the money-loss involved .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 8]: Come -- is n't that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 13]: `` Goodness knows I concede that , with all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 27]: When you 've found out the source of a disease , you 've also found out what remedy is required -- just as in this case .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 7]: In this case money is required .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 5]: And only money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 24]: The old , old seduction was in that airy , confident tone and those significant words -- usually called pregnant words in books .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 23]: The old answering signs of faith and hope showed up in Hawkins 's countenance , and he said : `` Only money ?
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 38]: Do you mean that you know a way to -- '' `` Washington , have you the impression that I have no resources but those I allow the public and my intimate friends to know about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 74]: `` Well , I -- er -- '' `` Is it likely , do you think , that a man moved by nature and taught by experience to keep his affairs to himself and a cautious and reluctant tongue in his head , would n't be thoughtful enough to keep a few resources in reserve for a rainy day , when he 's got as many as I have to select from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 15]: `` Oh , you make me feel so much better already , Colonel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 10]: `` Have you ever been in my laboratory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 6]: `` Why , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 12]: You see you did n't even know that I had one .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 14]: I 've got a little trick there that I want to show you .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 15]: I 've kept it perfectly quiet , not fifty people know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 11]: But that 's my way , always been my way .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 19]: Wait till you 're ready , that 's the idea ; and when you 're ready , zzip !
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 6]: -- let her go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 22]: `` Well , Colonel , I 've never seen a man that I 've had such unbounded confidence in as you .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 31]: When you say a thing right out , I always feel as if that ends it ; as if that is evidence , and proof , and everything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 9]: The old earl was profoundly pleased and touched .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 18]: `` I 'm glad you believe in me , Washington ; not everybody is so just . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 19]: `` I always have believed in you ; and I always shall as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 7]: `` Thank you , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 6]: You sha n't repent it .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 6]: And you ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 26]: Arrived in the `` laboratory , '' the earl continued , `` Now , cast your eye around this room -- what do you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 23]: Apparently a junk-shop ; apparently a hospital connected with a patent office -- in reality , the mines of Golconda in disguise !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 6]: Look at that thing there .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 11]: Now what would you take that thing to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 11]: `` I do n't believe I could ever imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 7]: `` Of course you could n't .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 13]: It 's my grand adaptation of the phonograph to the marine service .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 11]: You store up profanity in it for use at sea .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 34]: You know that sailors do n't fly around worth a cent unless you swear at them -- so the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most valuable man .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 9]: In great emergencies his talent saves the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 41]: But a ship is a large thing , and he ca n't be everywhere at once ; so there have been times when one mate has lost a ship which could have been saved if they had had a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 6]: Prodigious storms , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 41]: Well , a ship ca n't afford a hundred mates ; but she can afford a hundred Cursing Phonographs , and distribute them all over the vessel -- and there , you see , she 's armed at every point .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 22]: Imagine a big storm , and a hundred of my machines all cursing away at once -- splendid spectacle , splendid !
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 8]: -- you could n't hear yourself think .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 21]: Ship goes through that storm perfectly serene -- she 's just as safe as she 'd be on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 7]: `` It 's a wonderful idea .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 8]: How do you prepare the thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 9]: `` Load it -- simply load it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 13]: `` Why you just stand over it and swear into it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 9]: `` That loads it , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 16]: `` Yes -- because every word it collars , it keeps -- keeps it forever .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 4]: Never wears out .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 12]: Any time you turn the crank , out it 'll come .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 17]: In times of great peril , you can reverse it , and it 'll swear backwards .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 8]: That makes a sailor hump himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 6]: `` O , I see .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: Who loads them ?
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 5]: -- the mate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: `` Yes , if he chooses .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 8]: Or I 'll furnish them already loaded .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 27]: I can hire an expert for $ 75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in 150 hours , and do it easy .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 20]: And an expert can furnish a stronger article , of course , than the mere average uncultivated mate could .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 29]: Then you see , all the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded -- for I shall have them loaded in any language a customer wants .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 14]: Hawkins , it will work the grandest moral reform of the 19th century .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 30]: Five years from now , all the swearing will be done by machinery -- you wo n't ever hear a profane word come from human lips on a ship .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 21]: Millions of dollars have been spent by the churches , in the effort to abolish profanity in the commercial marine .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 33]: Think of it -- my name will live forever in the affections of good men as the man , who , solitary and alone , accomplished this noble and elevating reform . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 11]: `` O , it is grand and beneficent and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 10]: How did you ever come to think of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 6]: You have a wonderful mind .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 10]: How did you say you loaded the machine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 11]: `` O , it 's no trouble -- perfectly simple .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 19]: If you want to load it up loud and strong , you stand right over it and shout .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 40]: But if you leave it open and all set , it 'll eavesdrop , so to speak -- that is to say , it will load itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: Now I 'll show you how it works .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 12]: I had an expert come and load this one up yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 27]: Hello , it 's been left open -- it 's too bad -- still I reckon it has n't had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 15]: All you do is to press this button in the floor -- so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 31]: The phonograph began to sing in a plaintive voice : There is a boarding-house , far far away , Where they have ham and eggs , 3 times a day .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 9]: `` Hang it , that ai n't it .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 8]: Somebody 's been singing around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 54]: The plaintive song began again , mingled with a low , gradually rising wail of cats slowly warming up toward a fight ; O , how the boarders yell , When they hear that dinner bell They give that landlord -- -LRB- momentary outburst of terrific catfight which drowns out one word . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 5]: Three times a day .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 9]: -LRB- Renewal of furious catfight for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 25]: The plaintive voice on a high fierce key , `` Scat , you devils '' -- and a racket as of flying missiles . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 10]: `` Well , never mind -- let it go .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 17]: I 've got some sailor-profanity down in there somewhere , if I could get to it .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 15]: But it is n't any matter ; you see how the machine works . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 12]: Hawkins responded with enthusiasm : `` O , it works admirably !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 11]: I know there 's a hundred fortunes in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 14]: `` And mind , the Hawkins family get their share , Washington . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 15]: `` O , thanks , thanks ; you are just as generous as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 12]: Ah , it 's the grandest invention of the age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 11]: `` Ah , well ; we live in wonderful times .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 31]: The elements are crowded full of beneficent forces -- always have been -- and ours is the first generation to turn them to account and make them work for us .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 14]: Why Hawkins , everything is useful -- nothing ought ever to be wasted .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 9]: Now look at sewer gas , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 24]: Sewer gas has always been wasted , heretofore ; nobody tried to save up sewer-gas -- you ca n't name me a man .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 5]: Ai n't that so ?
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 9]: you know perfectly well it 's so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 30]: `` Yes it is so -- but I never -- er -- I do n't quite see why a body -- '' `` Should want to save it up ?
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 7]: Well , I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 8]: Do you see this little invention here ?
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 12]: -- it 's a decomposer -- I call it a decomposer .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 54]: I give you my word of honor that if you show me a house that produces a given quantity of sewer-gas in a day , I 'll engage to set up my decomposer there and make that house produce a hundred times that quantity of sewer-gas in less than half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: `` Dear me , but why should you want to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 4]: `` Want to ?
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 7]: Listen , and you 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 21]: My boy , for illuminating purposes and economy combined , there 's nothing in the world that begins with sewer-gas .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 10]: And really , it do n't cost a cent .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 27]: You put in a good inferior article of plumbing , -- such as you find everywhere -- and add my decomposer , and there you are .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 13]: Just use the ordinary gas pipes -- and there your expense ends .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 4]: Think of it .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 21]: Why , Major , in five years from now you wo n't see a house lighted with anything but sewer-gas .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 14]: Every physician I talk to , recommends it ; and every plumber . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 8]: `` But is n't it dangerous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 29]: `` O , yes , more or less , but everything is -- coal gas , candles , electricity -- there is n't anything that ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 10]: `` It lights up well , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 6]: `` O , magnificently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 10]: `` Have you given it a good trial ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 11]: `` Well , no , not a first rate one .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 43]: Polly 's prejudiced , and she wo n't let me put it in here ; but I 'm playing my cards to get it adopted in the President 's house , and then it 'll go -- do n't you doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 30]: I shall not need this one for the present , Washington ; you may take it down to some boarding-house and give it a trial if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 24]: Washington shuddered slightly at the suggestion , then his face took on a dreamy look and he dropped into a trance of thought .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 16]: After a little , Sellers asked him what he was grinding in his mental mill .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 5]: `` Well , this .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 24]: Have you got some secret project in your head which requires a Bank of England back of it to make it succeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 20]: The Colonel showed lively astonishment , and said : `` Why , Hawkins , are you a mind-reader ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 9]: I never thought of such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 18]: `` Well , then how did you happen to drop onto that idea in this curious fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 18]: It 's just mind-reading , that 's what it is , though you may not know it .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 17]: Because I have got a private project that requires a Bank of England at its back .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 6]: How could you divine that ?
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: What was the process ?
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 5]: This is interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 7]: `` There was n't any process .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 22]: A thought like this happened to slip through my head by accident : How much would make you or me comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: A hundred thousand .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 30]: Yet you are expecting two or three of -- these inventions of yours to turn out some billions of money -- and you are wanting them to do that .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 18]: If you wanted ten millions , I could understand that -- it 's inside the human limits .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 3]: But billions !
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 7]: That 's clear outside the limits .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 12]: There must be a definite project back of that somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 35]: The earl 's interest and surprise augmented with every word , and when Hawkins finished , he said with strong admiration : `` It 's wonderfully reasoned out , Washington , it certainly is .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 10]: It shows what I think is quite extraordinary penetration .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 21]: For you 've hit it ; you 've driven the centre , you 've plugged the bulls-eye of my dream .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 15]: Now I 'll tell you the whole thing , and you 'll understand it .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 36]: I do n't need to ask you to keep it to yourself , because you 'll see that the project will prosper all the better for being kept in the background till the right time .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 18]: Have you noticed how many pamphlets and books I 've got lying around relating to Russia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 18]: `` Yes , I think most anybody would notice that -- anybody who was n't dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 12]: `` Well , I 've been posting myself a good while .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 17]: That 's a great and , splendid nation , and deserves to be set free . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 26]: He paused , then added in a quite matter-of-fact way , `` When I get this money I 'm going to set it free . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 5]: `` Great guns ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 11]: `` Why , what makes you jump like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 48]: `` Dear me , when you are going to drop a remark under a man 's chair that is likely to blow him out through the roof , why do n't you put some expression , some force , some noise unto it that will prepare him ?
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 19]: You should n't flip out such a gigantic thing as this in that colorless kind of a way .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 9]: You do jolt a person up , so .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 11]: Go on , now , I 'm all right again .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 6]: Tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 13]: I 'm all interest -- yes , and sympathy , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 42]: `` Well , I 've looked the ground over , and concluded that the methods of the Russian patriots , while good enough considering the way the boys are hampered , are not the best ; at least not the quickest .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 34]: They are trying to revolutionize Russia from within ; that 's pretty slow , you know , and liable to interruption all the time , and is full of perils for the workers .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 11]: Do you know how Peter the Great started his army ?
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 42]: He did n't start it on the family premises under the noses of the Strelitzes ; no , he started it away off yonder , privately , -- only just one regiment , you know , and he built to that .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 26]: The first thing the Strelitzes knew , the regiment was an army , their position was turned , and they had to take a walk .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 18]: Just that little idea made the biggest and worst of all the despotisms the world has seen .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 7]: The same idea can unmake it .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 7]: I 'm going to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 19]: I 'm going to get out to one side and work my scheme the way Peter did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: `` This is mighty interesting , Rossmore .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 11]: What is it you are , going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 13]: `` I am going to buy Siberia and start a republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 14]: `` There , -- bang you go again , without giving any notice !
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 6]: Going to buy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 11]: `` Yes , as soon as I get the money .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 14]: I do n't care what the price is , I shall take it .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 9]: I can afford it , and I will .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 18]: Now then , consider this -- and you 've never thought of it , I 'll warrant .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 53]: Where is the place where there is twenty-five times more manhood , pluck , true heroism , unselfishness , devotion to high and noble ideals , adoration of liberty , wide education , and brains , per thousand of population , than any other domain in the whole world can show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 4]: `` Siberia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 4]: `` Right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 19]: `` It is true ; it certainly is true , but I never thought of it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 7]: `` Nobody ever thinks of it .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: But it 's so , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 26]: In those mines and prisons are gathered together the very finest and noblest and capablest multitude of human beings that God is able to create .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 20]: Now if you had that kind of a population to sell , would you offer it to a despotism ?
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: No , the despotism has no use for it ; you would lose money .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 11]: A despotism has no use for anything but human cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 10]: But suppose you want to start a republic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 6]: `` Yes , I see .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 9]: It 's just the material for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 8]: `` Well , I should say so !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 33]: There 's Siberia with just the very finest and choicest material on the globe for a republic , and more coming -- more coming all the time , do n't you see !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 23]: It is being daily , weekly , monthly recruited by the most perfectly devised system that has ever been invented , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 63]: By this system the whole of the hundred millions of Russia are being constantly and patiently sifted , sifted , sifted , by myriads of trained experts , spies appointed by the Emperor personally ; and whenever they catch a man , woman or child that has got any brains or education or character , they ship that person straight to Siberia .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: It is admirable , it is wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 26]: It is so searching and so effective that it keeps the general level of Russian intellect and education down to that of the Czar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 9]: `` Come , that sounds like exaggeration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 10]: `` Well , it 's what they say anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 11]: But I think , myself , it 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 16]: And it does n't seem right to slander a whole nation that way , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 20]: Now , then , you see what the material is , there in Siberia , for a republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 22]: He paused , and his breast began to heave and his eye to burn , under the impulse of strong emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 29]: Then his words began to stream forth , with constantly increasing energy and fire , and he rose to his feet as if to give himself larger freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 63]: `` The minute I organize that republic , the light of liberty , intelligence , justice , humanity , bursting from it , flooding from it , flaming from it , will concentrate the gaze of the whole astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun ; Russia 's countless multitudes of slaves will rise up and march , march !
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 26]: -- eastward , with that great light transfiguring their faces as they come , and far back of them you will see-what will you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 9]: -- a vacant throne in an empty land !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 14]: It can be done , and by God I will do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 41]: He stood a moment bereft of earthy consciousness by his exaltation ; then consciousness returned , bringing him a slight shock , and he said with grave earnestness : `` I must ask you to pardon me , Major Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 19]: I have never used that expression before , and I beg you will forgive it this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 5]: Hawkins was quite willing .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 19]: `` You see , Washington , it is an error which I am by nature not liable to .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 12]: Only excitable people , impulsive people , are exposed to it .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 46]: But the circumstances of the present case -- I being a democrat by birth and preference , and an aristocrat by inheritance and relish -- '' The earl stopped suddenly , his frame stiffened , and he began to stare speechless through the curtainless window .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 16]: Then he pointed , and gasped out a single rapturous word : `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 8]: `` What is it , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 4]: `` IT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 7]: `` Sure as you 're born .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 4]: Keep perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 14]: I 'll apply the influence -- I 'll turn on all my force .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 16]: I 've brought It thus far -- I 'll fetch It right into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 5]: You 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 14]: He was making all sorts of passes in the air with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 4]: Look at that .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 6]: I 've made It smile !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 3]: Quite true .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 21]: Tracy , out for an afternoon stroll , had come unexpectantly upon his family arms displayed upon this shabby house-front .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 19]: The hatchments made him smile ; which was nothing , they had made the neighborhood cats do that .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 7]: `` Look , Hawkins , look !
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 7]: I 'm drawing It over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 9]: `` You 're drawing it sure , Rossmore .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 20]: If I ever had any doubts about materialization , they 're gone , now , and gone for good .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 9]: Oh , this is a joyful day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 9]: Tracy was sauntering over to read the door-plate .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 25]: Before he was half way over he was saying to himself , `` Why , manifestly these are the American Claimant 's quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 9]: `` It 's coming -- coming right along .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 10]: I 'll slide , down and pull It in .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 6]: You follow after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 16]: Sellers , pale and a good deal agitated , opened the door and confronted Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 47]: The old man could not at once get his voice : then he pumped out a scattering and hardly coherent salutation , and followed it with -- `` Walk in , walk right in , Mr. -- er -- '' `` Tracy -- Howard Tracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 14]: `` Tracy -- thanks -- walk right in , you 're expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 12]: Tracy entered , considerably puzzled , and said : `` Expected ?
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: I think there must be some mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 45]: `` Oh , I judge not , '' said Sellers , who -- noticing that Hawkins had arrived , gave him a sidewise glance intended to call his close attention to a dramatic effect which he was proposing to produce by his next remark .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 17]: Then he said , slowly and impressively -- `` I am -- YOU KNOW WHO . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 33]: To the astonishment of both conspirators the remark produced no dramatic effect at all ; for the new-comer responded with a quite innocent and unembarrassed air -- `` No , pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 8]: I do n't know who you are .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 22]: I only suppose -- but no doubt correctly -- that you are the gentleman whose title is on the doorplate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 14]: `` Right , quite right -- sit down , pray sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 17]: The earl was rattled , thrown off his bearings , his head was in a whirl .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 30]: Then he noticed Hawkins standing apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the apparition of a defunct man , and a new idea was born to him .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 26]: He said to Tracy briskly : `` But a thousand pardons , dear sir , I am forgetting courtesies due to a guest and stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 47]: Let me introduce my friend General Hawkins -- General Hawkins , our new Senator -- Senator from the latest and grandest addition to the radiant galaxy of sovereign States , Cherokee Strip '' -- -LRB- to himself , `` that name will shrivel him up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 40]: -- but it did n't , in the least , and the Colonel resumed the introduction piteously disheartened and amazed -RRB- , -- `` Senator Hawkins , Mr. Howard Tracy , of -- er -- '' `` England . ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 3]: `` England !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 17]: -- Why that 's im -- '' `` England , yes , native of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 6]: `` Recently from there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 7]: `` Yes , quite recently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 14]: Said the Colonel to himself , `` This phantom lies like an expert .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 9]: Purifying this kind by fire do n't work .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 20]: I 'll sound him a little further , give him another chance or two to work his gift . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 20]: Then aloud -- with deep irony -- `` Visiting our great country for recreation and amusement , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 42]: I suppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our Far West is -- '' `` I have n't been West , and have n't been devoting myself to amusement with any sort of exclusiveness , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 18]: In fact , to merely live , an artist has got to work , not play . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 4]: `` Artist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 20]: said Hawkins to himself , thinking of the rifled bank ; `` that is a name for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 7]: `` Are you an artist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 19]: asked the colonel ; and added to himself , `` now I 'm going to catch him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 9]: `` In a humble way , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 5]: `` What line ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 5]: pursued the sly veteran .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 4]: `` Oils . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 7]: `` I 've got him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 5]: said Sellers to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 8]: Then aloud , `` This is fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 16]: Could I engage you to restore some of my paintings that need that attention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 7]: `` I shall be very glad .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 7]: Pray let me see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 15]: No shuffling , no evasion , no embarrassment , even under this crucial test .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 5]: The Colonel was nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 51]: He led Tracy to a chromo which had suffered damage in a former owner 's hands through being used as a lamp mat , and said , with a flourish of his hand toward the picture -- `` This del Sarto -- '' `` Is that a del Sarto ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 43]: The colonel bent a look of reproach upon Tracy , allowed it to sink home , then resumed as if there had been no interruption -- `` This del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master in our country .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 43]: You see , yourself , that the work is of such exceeding delicacy that the risk -- could -- er -- would you mind giving me a little example of what you can do before we -- '' `` Cheerfully , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 9]: I will copy one of these marvels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 14]: Water-color materials -- relics of Miss Sally 's college life -- were brought .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 16]: Tracy said he was better in oils , but would take a chance with these .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 6]: So he was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 31]: He began his work , but the attractions of the place were too strong for him , and he got up and went drifting about , fascinated ; also amazed .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 14]: Meantime the earl and Hawkins were holding a troubled and anxious private consultation .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 22]: The earl said : `` The mystery that bothers me , is , where did It get its other arm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: `` Yes -- it worries me , too .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 11]: And another thing troubles me -- the apparition is English .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 10]: How do you account for that , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 16]: `` Honestly , I do n't know , Hawkins , I do n't really know .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 8]: It is very confusing and awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 15]: `` Do n't you think maybe we 've waked up the wrong one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: `` The wrong one ?
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 9]: How do you account for the clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 13]: `` The clothes are right , there 's no getting around it .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 7]: What are we going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 9]: We ca n't collect , as I see .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 8]: The reward is for a one-armed American .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 7]: This is a two-armed Englishman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 12]: `` Well , it may be that that is not objectionable .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 33]: You see it is n't less than is called for , it is more , and so , -- '' But he saw that this argument was weak , and dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 12]: The friends sat brooding over their perplexities some time in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 35]: Finally the earl 's face began to glow with an inspiration , and he said , impressively : `` Hawkins , this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we have dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 14]: We have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous thing we have done .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 15]: The whole secret is perfectly clear to me , now , clear as day .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 16]: Every man is made up of heredities , long-descended atoms and particles of his ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 6]: This present materialization is incomplete .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 15]: We have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of this century . ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , Colonel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 17]: cried Hawkins , filled with vague alarms by the old man 's awe-compelling words and manner .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 3]: `` This .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 9]: We 've materialized this burglar 's ancestor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 11]: `` Oh , do n't -- do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 5]: It 's hideous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: `` But it 's true , Hawkins , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 5]: Look at the facts .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 9]: This apparition is distinctly English -- note that .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 8]: It uses good grammar -- note that .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 8]: It is an Artist -- note that .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 13]: It has the manners and carriage of a gentleman -- note that .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 5]: Where 's your cow-boy ?
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 5]: Answer me that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 16]: `` Rossmore , this is dreadful -- it 's too dreadful to think of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 23]: `` Never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes , not a solitary rag of him but the clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 26]: `` Colonel , do you really mean -- '' The Colonel brought his fist down with emphasis and said : `` I mean exactly this .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 20]: The materialization was immature , the burglar has evaded us , this is nothing but a damned ancestor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 10]: He rose and walked the floor in great excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 14]: Hawkins said plaintively : `` It 's a bitter disappointment -- bitter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 5]: `` I know it .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 15]: I know it , Senator ; I feel it as deeply as anybody could .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 11]: But we 've got to submit -- on moral grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 37]: I need money , but God knows I am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing of a man 's ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor 's posterity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 5]: `` But Colonel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 82]: implored Hawkins ; `` stop and think ; do n't be rash ; you know it 's the only chance we 've got to get the money ; and besides , the Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that had n't anything to do with them ; and so it 's only fair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 12]: The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 12]: He strode up and down , and thought it painfully over .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 19]: Finally he said : `` There 's reason in it ; yes , there 's reason in it .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 42]: And so , although it seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he had n't the least hand in , still if duty commands I suppose we must give him up to the authorities . ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 29]: `` I would , '' said Hawkins , cheered and relieved , `` I 'd give him up if he was a thousand ancestors compacted into one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 43]: `` Lord bless me , that 's just what he is , '' said Sellers , with something like a groan , `` it 's exactly what he is ; there 's a contribution in him from every ancestor he ever had .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 82]: In him there 's atoms of priests , soldiers , crusaders , poets , and sweet and gracious women -- all kinds and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old , old centuries , and vanished out of it ages ago , and now by act of ours they are summoned from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out on the borders of Cherokee Strip , and it 's just a howling outrage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 42]: `` Oh , do n't talk like that , Colonel ; it takes the heart all out of me , and makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to -- '' `` Wait -- I 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 5]: `` A saving hope ?
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 9]: Shout it out , I am perishing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 14]: `` It 's perfectly simple ; a child would have thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 20]: He is all right , not a flaw in him , as far as I have carried the work .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 24]: If I 've been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century , what 's to stop me now ?
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 12]: I 'll go on and materialize him down to date . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 10]: `` Land , I never thought of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 8]: said Hawkins all ablaze with joy again .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 7]: `` It 's the very thing .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 7]: What a brain you have got !
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 9]: And will he shed the superfluous arm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 5]: `` He will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 8]: `` And lose his English accent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 6]: `` It will wholly disappear .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 13]: He will speak Cherokee Strip -- and other forms of profanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 9]: `` Colonel , maybe he 'll confess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 3]: `` Confess ?
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 6]: Merely that bank robbery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 3]: `` Merely ?
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 9]: Yes , but why ` merely ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 20]: The Colonel said in his most impressive manner : `` Hawkins , he will be wholly under my command .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 11]: I will make him confess every crime he ever committed .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 6]: There must be a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 7]: Do you get the idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: `` Well -- not quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 9]: `` The rewards will come to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 4]: `` Prodigious conception !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 23]: I never saw such ahead for seeing with a lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a central idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 11]: `` It is nothing ; it comes natural to me .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 33]: When his time is out in one jail he goes to the next and the next , and we shall have nothing to do but collect the rewards as he goes along .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 14]: It is a perfectly steady income as long as we live , Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 15]: And much better than other kinds of investments , because he is indestructible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: `` It looks -- it really does look the way you say ; it does indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 3]: `` Look ?
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 5]: -- why it is .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 40]: It will not be denied that I have had a pretty wide and comprehensive financial experience , and I do not hesitate to say that I consider this one of the most valuable properties I have ever controlled . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 8]: `` Do you really think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 7]: `` I do , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 13]: `` O , Colonel , the wasting grind and grief of poverty !
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 6]: If we could realize immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 28]: I do n't mean sell it all , but sell part -- enough , you know , to -- '' `` See how you tremble with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 7]: That comes of lack of experience .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 22]: My boy , when you have been familiar with vast operations as long as I have , you 'll be different .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 9]: Look at me ; is my eye dilated ?
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 7]: do you notice a quiver anywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 13]: Feel my pulse : plunk-plunk-plunk -- same as if I were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 12]: And yet , what is passing through my calm cold mind ?
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 17]: A procession of figures which would make a financial novice drunk just the sight of them .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 46]: Now it is by keeping cool , and looking at a thing all around , that a man sees what 's really in it , and saves himself from the novice 's unfailing mistake -- the one you 've just suggested -- eagerness to realize .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 4]: Listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 13]: Your idea is to sell a part of him for ready cash .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 7]: Now mine is -- guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 7]: `` I have n't an idea .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 8]: `` Stock him -- of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 12]: `` Well , I should never have thought of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 8]: `` Because you are not a financier .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 8]: Say he has committed a thousand crimes .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 7]: Certainly that 's a low estimate .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 20]: By the look of him , even in his unfinished condition , he has committed all of a million .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 31]: But call it only a thousand to be perfectly safe ; five thousand reward , multiplied by a thousand , gives us a dead sure cash basis of -- what ?
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 5]: Five million dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 10]: `` Wait -- let me get my breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: `` And the property indestructible .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 21]: Perpetually fruitful -- perpetually ; for a property with his disposition will go on committing crimes and winning rewards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 12]: `` You daze me , you make my head whirl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 13]: `` Let it whirl , it wo n't do it any harm .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 11]: Now that matter is all fixed -- leave it alone .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 16]: I 'll get up the company and issue the stock , all in good time .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 7]: Just leave it in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 19]: I judge you do n't doubt my ability to work it up for all it is worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 6]: `` Indeed I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 8]: I can say that with truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 6]: `` All right , then .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 5]: That 's disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 5]: Everything in its turn .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 16]: We old operators , go by order and system -- no helter-skelter business with us .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: What 's the next thing on the docket ?
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 14]: The carrying on of the materialization -- the bringing it down to date .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 8]: I will begin on that at once .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 9]: I think -- `` Look here , Rossmore .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 7]: You did n't lock It in .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 9]: A hundred to one it has escaped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 16]: `` Calm yourself , as to that ; do n't give yourself any uneasiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 9]: `` But why should n't it escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 9]: `` Let it , if it wants to ?
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 5]: What of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 13]: `` Well , I should consider it a pretty serious calamity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 17]: `` Why , my dear boy , once in my power , always in my power .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 7]: It may go and come freely .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 19]: I can produce it here whenever I want it , just by the exercise of my will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 17]: `` Well , I am truly glad to hear that , I do assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 31]: `` Yes , I shall give it all the painting it wants to do , and we and the family will make it as comfortable and contented as we can .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 7]: No occasion to restrain its movements .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 50]: I hope to persuade it to remain pretty quiet , though , because a materialization which is in a state of arrested development must of necessity be pretty soft and flabby and substanceless , and -- er -- by the way , I wonder where It comes from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 11]: The earl pointed significantly -- and interrogatively toward the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 18]: Hawkins started ; then settled into deep reflection ; finally shook his head sorrowfully and pointed downwards .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: `` What makes you think so , Washington ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 29]: `` Well , I hardly know , but really you can see , yourself , that he does n't seem to be pining for his last place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 6]: `` It 's well thought !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 3]: Soundly deduced .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 8]: We 've done that Thing a favor .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 24]: But I believe I will pump it a little , in a quiet way , and find out if we are right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 22]: `` How long is it going to take to finish him off and fetch him down to date , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 11]: `` I wish I knew , but I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 31]: I am clear knocked out by this new detail -- this unforeseen necessity of working a subject down gradually from his condition of ancestor to his ultimate result as posterity .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 11]: But I 'll make him hump himself , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 4]: `` Rossmore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 5]: `` Yes , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: We 're in the laboratory .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 6]: Come -- Hawkins is here .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 24]: Mind , now Hawkins -- he 's a sound , living , human being to all the family -- do n't forget that .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 5]: Here she comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 11]: `` Keep your seats , I 'm not coming in .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 16]: I just wanted to ask , who is it that 's painting down there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 3]: `` That ?
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 51]: Oh , that 's a young artist ; young Englishman , named Tracy ; very promising -- favorite pupil of Hans Christian Andersen or one of the other old masters -- Andersen I 'm pretty sure it is ; he 's going to half-sole some of our old Italian masterpieces .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 6]: Been talking to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 7]: `` Well , only a word .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 12]: I stumbled right in on him without expecting anybody was there .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 70]: I tried to be polite to him ; offered him a snack '' -- -LRB- Sellers delivered a large wink to Hawkins from behind his hand -RRB- , `` but he declined , and said he was n't hungry '' -LRB- another sarcastic wink -RRB- ; `` so I brought some apples '' -LRB- doublewink -RRB- , `` and he ate a couple of -- '' `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 16]: and the colonel sprang some yards toward the ceiling and came down quaking with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 8]: Lady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 22]: She gazed at the sheepish relic of Cherokee Strip , then at her husband , and then at the guest again .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 15]: Finally she said : `` What is the matter with you , Mulberry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 6]: He did not answer immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 18]: His back was turned ; he was bending over his chair , feeling the seat of it .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 22]: But he answered next moment , and said : `` Ah , there it is ; it was a tack . ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 21]: The lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment , then said , pretty snappishly : `` All that for a tack !
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 19]: Praise goodness it was n't a shingle nail , it would have landed you in the Milky Way .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 12]: I do hate to have my nerves shook up so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 11]: And she turned on her heel and went her way .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 26]: As soon as she was safely out , the Colonel said , in a suppressed voice : `` Come -- we must see for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 7]: It must be a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 8]: They hurried softly down and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 13]: Sellers whispered , in a sort of despair -- It is eating !
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 5]: What a grisly spectacle !
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 5]: Hawkins it 's horrible !
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 16]: Take me away -- I ca n't stand -- They tottered back to the laboratory .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 16]: Tracy made slow progress with his work , for his mind wandered a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 6]: Many things were puzzling him .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 71]: Finally a light burst upon him all of a sudden -- seemed to , at any rate -- and he said to himself , `` I 've got the clew at last -- this man 's mind is off its balance ; I do n't know how much , but it 's off a point or two , sure ; off enough to explain this mess of perplexities , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 49]: These dreadful chromos which he takes for old masters ; these villainous portraits -- which to his frantic mind represent Rossmores ; the hatchments ; the pompous name of this ramshackle old crib -- Rossmore Towers ; and that odd assertion of his , that I was expected .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 6]: How could I be expected ?
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 6]: that is , Lord Berkeley .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 16]: He knows by the papers that that person was burned up in the New Gadsby .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 39]: Why , hang it , he really does n't know who he was expecting ; for his talk showed that he was not expecting an Englishman , or yet an artist , yet I answer his requirements notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: He seems sufficiently satisfied with me .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 24]: Yes , he is a little off ; in fact I am afraid he is a good deal off , poor old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 16]: But he 's interesting -- all people in about his condition are , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 19]: I hope he 'll like my work ; I would like to come every day and study him .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 12]: And when I write my father -- ah , that hurts !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 16]: I must n't get on that subject ; it is n't good for my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 9]: Somebody coming -- I must get to work .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 7]: It 's the old gentleman again .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 4]: He looks bothered .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: Maybe my clothes are suspicious ; and they are -- for an artist .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 19]: If my conscience would allow me to make a change , but that is out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 17]: I wonder what he 's making those passes in the air for , with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 9]: I seem to be the object of them .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: Can he be trying to mesmerize me ?
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 7]: I do n't quite like it .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 8]: There 's something uncanny about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 20]: The colonel muttered to himself , `` It has an effect on him , I can see it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 10]: That 's enough for one time , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 17]: He 's not very solid , yet , I suppose , and I might disintegrate him .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 33]: I 'll just put a sly question or two at him , now , and see if I can find out what his condition is , and where he 's from . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 29]: He approached and said affably : `` Do n't let me disturb you , Mr. Tracy ; I only want to take a little glimpse of your work .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 12]: Ah , that 's fine -- that 's very fine indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: You are doing it elegantly .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 8]: My daughter will be charmed with this .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 8]: May I sit down by you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 11]: `` Oh , do ; I shall be glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 7]: `` It wo n't disturb you ?
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 10]: I mean , wo n't dissipate your inspirations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 15]: Tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily discommoded .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 60]: The colonel asked a number of cautious and well-considered questions -- questions which seemed pretty odd and flighty to Tracy -- but the answers conveyed the information desired , apparently , for the colonel said to himself , with mixed pride and gratification : `` It 's a good job as far as I 've got , with it .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 4]: He 's solid .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 13]: Solid and going to last , solid as the real thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 7]: `` It 's wonderful -- wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 9]: I believe I could -- petrify him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 20]: After a little he asked , warily `` Do you prefer being here , or -- or there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 3]: `` There ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 3]: Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 11]: `` Why -- er -- where you 've been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 14]: Tracy 's thought flew to his boarding-house , and he answered with decision .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 8]: `` Oh , here , much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 19]: The colonel was startled , and said to himself , `` There 's no uncertain ring about that .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 11]: It indicates where he 's been to , poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 8]: Well , I am satisfied , now .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 9]: I 'm glad I got him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 13]: He sat thinking , and thinking , and watching the brush go .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 27]: At length he said to himself , `` Yes , it certainly seems to account for the failure of my endeavors in poor Berkeley 's case .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 7]: He went in the other direction .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 7]: Well , it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 6]: He 's better off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 21]: Sally Sellers entered from the street , now , looking her divinest , and the artist was introduced to her .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 24]: It was a violent case of mutual love at first sight , though neither party was entirely aware of the fact , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 20]: The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself , `` Perhaps he is not insane , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 38]: Sally sat down , and showed an interest in Tracy 's work which greatly pleased him , and a benevolent forgiveness of it which convinced him that the girl 's nature was cast in a large mould .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 45]: Sellers was anxious to report his discoveries to Hawkins ; so he took his leave , saying that if the two `` young devotees of the colored Muse '' thought they could manage without him , he would go and look after his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 23]: The artist said to himself , `` I think he is a little eccentric , perhaps , but that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 22]: He reproached himself for having injuriously judged a man without giving him any fair chance to show what he really was .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 15]: Of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 57]: The average American girl possesses the valuable qualities of naturalness , honesty , and inoffensive straightforwardness ; she is nearly barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities , consequently her presence and her ways are unembarrassing , and one is acquainted with her and on the pleasantest terms with her before he knows how it came about .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 51]: This new acquaintanceship -- friendship , indeed -- progressed swiftly ; and the unusual swiftness of it , and the thoroughness of it are sufficiently evidenced and established by one noteworthy fact -- that within the first half hour both parties had ceased to be conscious of Tracy 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 31]: Later this consciousness was re-awakened ; it was then apparent to Gwendolen that she was almost reconciled to them , and it was apparent to Tracy that he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 16]: The re-awakening was brought about by Gwendolen 's inviting the artist to stay to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 39]: He had to decline , because he wanted to live , now -- that is , now that there was something to live for -- and he could not survive in those clothes at a gentleman 's table .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: He thought he knew that .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 14]: But he went away happy , for he saw that Gwendolen was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 6]: And whither did he go ?
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 26]: He went straight to a slopshop and bought as neat and reasonably well-fitting a suit of clothes as an Englishman could be persuaded to wear .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 38]: He said -- to himself , but at his conscience -- `` I know it 's wrong ; but it would be wrong not to do it ; and two wrongs do not make a right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 10]: This satisfied him , and made his heart light .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 17]: Perhaps it will also satisfy the reader -- if he can make out what it means .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 18]: The old people were troubled about Gwendolen at dinner , because she was so distraught and silent .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 76]: If they had noticed , they would have found that she was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk stumbled upon the artist and his work ; but they did n't notice , and so the chat would swap around to some other subject , and then somebody would presently be privately worrying about Gwendolen again , and wondering if she were not well , or if something had gone wrong in the millinery line .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 59]: Her mother offered her various reputable patent medicines , and tonics with iron and other hardware in them , and her father even proposed to send out for wine , relentless prohibitionist and head of the order in the District of Columbia as he was , but these kindnesses were all declined -- thankfully , but with decision .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 38]: At bedtime , when the family were breaking up for the night , she privately looted one of the brushes , saying to herself , `` It 's the one he has used , the most . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 26]: The next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new suit , and equipped with a pink in his button-hole -- a daily attention from Puss .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 18]: His whole soul was full of Gwendolen Sellers , and this condition was an inspiration , art-wise .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 73]: All the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at the canvases , almost without his awarity -- awarity , in this sense being the sense of being aware , though disputed by some authorities -- turning out marvel upon marvel , in the way of decorative accessories to the portraits , with a felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of the firm and fetched out of them continuous explosions of applause .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 11]: Meantime Gwendolen was losing her morning , and many dollars .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 20]: She supposed Tracy was coming in the forenoon -- a conclusion which she had jumped to without outside help .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 27]: So she tripped down stairs every little while from her work-parlor to arrange the brushes and things over again , and see if he had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 26]: And when she was in her work-parlor it was not profitable , but just the other way -- as she found out to her sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 49]: She had put in her idle moments during the last little while back , in designing a particularly rare and capable gown for herself , and this morning she set about making it up ; but she was absent minded , and made an irremediable botch of it .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 36]: When she saw what she had done , she knew the reason of it and the meaning of it ; and she put her work away from her and said she would accept the sign .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 21]: And from that time forth she came no more away from the Audience Chamber , but remained there and waited .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 6]: After luncheon she waited again .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 4]: A whole hour .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 16]: Then a great joy welled up in her heart , for she saw him coming .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 35]: So she flew back up stairs thankful , and could hardly wait for him to miss the principal brush , which she had mislaid down there , but knew where she had mislaid it .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 79]: However , all in good time the others were called in and could n't find the brush , and then she was sent for , and she could n't find it herself for some little time ; but then she found it when the others had gone away to hunt in the kitchen and down cellar and in the woodshed , and all those other places where people look for things whose ways they are not familiar with .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 111]: So she gave him the brush , and remarked that she ought to have seen that everything was ready for him , but it had n't seemed necessary , because it was so early that she was n't expecting -- but she stopped there , surprised at herself for what she was saying ; and he felt caught and ashamed , and said to himself , `` I knew my impatience would drag me here before I was expected , and betray me , and that is just what it has done ; she sees straight through me -- and is laughing at me , inside , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 41]: Gwendolen was very much pleased , on one account , and a little the other way in another ; pleased with the new clothes and the improvement which they had achieved ; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 28]: Yesterday 's pink had hardly interested her ; this one was just like it , but somehow it had got her immediate attention , and kept it .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 21]: She wished she could think of some way of getting at its history in a properly colorless and indifferent way .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 6]: Presently she made a venture .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 27]: She said : `` Whatever a man 's age may be , he can reduce it several years by putting a bright-colored flower in his button-hole .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 6]: I have often noticed that .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 12]: Is that your sex 's reason for wearing a boutonniere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 15]: `` I fancy not , but certainly that reason would be a sufficient one .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 10]: I 've never heard of the idea before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: `` You seem to prefer pinks .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 13]: Is it on account of the color , or the form ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 17]: `` Oh no , '' he said , simply , `` they are given to me .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 10]: I do n't think I have any preference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 22]: `` They are given to him , '' she said to herself , and she felt a coldness toward that pink .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 14]: `` I wonder who it is , and what she is like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 38]: The flower began to take up a good deal of room ; it obtruded itself everywhere , it intercepted all views , and marred them ; it was becoming exceedingly annoying and conspicuous for a little thing .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 10]: `` I wonder if he cares for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 9]: That thought gave her a quite definite pain .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 17]: She had made everything comfortable for the artist ; there was no further pretext for staying .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 23]: So she said she would go , now , and asked him to summon the servants in case he should need anything .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 20]: She went away unhappy ; and she left unhappiness behind her ; for she carried away all the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 9]: The time dragged heavily for both , now .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 24]: He could n't paint for thinking of her ; she could n't design or millinerize with any heart , for thinking of him .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 22]: Never before had painting seemed so empty to him , never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 15]: She had gone without repeating that dinner-invitation -- an almost unendurable disappointment to him .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 20]: On her part-well , she was suffering , too ; for she had found she could n't invite him .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 12]: It was not hard yesterday , but it was impossible to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 18]: A thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been filched from her unawares in the past twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 11]: To-day she felt strangely hampered , restrained of her liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 33]: To-day she could n't propose to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young man without being instantly paralyzed into non-action by the fear that he might `` suspect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 6]: Invite him to dinner to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 9]: It made her shiver to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 9]: And so her afternoon was one long fret .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 4]: Broken at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 25]: Three times she had to go down stairs on errands -- that is , she thought she had to go down stairs on errands .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 70]: Thus , going and coming , she had six glimpses of him , in the aggregate , without seeming to look in his direction ; and she tried to endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign , but they fluttered her up a good deal , and she felt that the naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 50]: The painter had his share of the rapture ; he had his six glimpses , and they smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him , beat upon him , washed over him deliciously , and drowned out all consciousness of what he was doing with his brush .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: So there were six places in his canvas which had to be done over again .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 27]: At last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the Thompsons , in the neighborhood , that she was coming there to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 38]: She would n't be reminded , at that table , that there was an absentee who ought to be a presentee -- a word which she meant to look out in the dictionary at a calmer time .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 23]: About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist , and invited him to stay to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 59]: Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude by a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces ; and he felt that now that he was going to be close to Gwendolen , and hear her voice and watch her face during several precious hours , earth had nothing valuable to add to his life for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 15]: The earl said to himself , `` This spectre can eat apples , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 13]: We shall find out , now , if that is a specialty .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 10]: I think , myself , it 's a specialty .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 10]: Apples , without doubt , constitute the spectral limit .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 9]: It was the case with our first parents .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 12]: No , I am wrong -- at least only partly right .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 23]: The line was drawn at apples , just as in the present case , but it was from the other direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 12]: The new clothes gave him a thrill of pleasure and pride .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 19]: He said to himself , `` I 've got part of him down to date , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 44]: Sellers said he was pleased with Tracy 's work ; and he went on and engaged him to restore his old masters , and said he should also want him to paint his portrait and his wife 's and possibly his daughter 's .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 13]: The tide of the artist 's happiness was at flood , now .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 21]: The chat flowed pleasantly along while Tracy painted and Sellers carefully unpacked a picture which he had brought with him .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 12]: It was a chromo ; a new one , just out .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 38]: It was the smirking , self-satisfied portrait of a man who was inundating the Union with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his specialty , which was a three-dollar shoe or a dress-suit or something of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 23]: The old gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and gazed down tenderly upon it , and became silent and meditative .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 11]: Presently Tracy noticed that he was dripping tears on it .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 40]: This touched the young fellow 's sympathetic nature , and at the same time gave him the painful sense of being an intruder upon a sacred privacy , an observer of emotions which a stranger ought not to witness .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 29]: But his pity rose superior to other considerations , and compelled him to try to comfort the old mourner with kindly words and a show of friendly interest .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 47]: He said : `` I am very sorry -- is it a friend whom -- '' `` Ah , more than that , far more than that -- a relative , the dearest I had on earth , although I was never permitted to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 23]: Yes , it is young Lord Berkeley , who perished so heroically in the awful conflagration , what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 8]: `` Oh , nothing , nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 30]: `` It was a little startling to be so suddenly brought face to face , so to speak , with a person one has heard so much talk about .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 7]: Is it a good likeness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: `` Without doubt , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 43]: I never saw him , but you can easily see the resemblance to his father , '' said Sellers , holding up the chromo and glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and back again with an approving eye .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 16]: `` Well , no -- I am not sure that I make out the likeness .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 35]: It is plain that the Usurping Earl there has a great deal of character and a long face like a horse 's , whereas his heir here is smirky , moon-faced and characterless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 20]: `` We are all that way in the beginning -- all the line , '' said Sellers , undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 21]: `` We all start as moonfaced fools , then later we tadpole along into horse-faced marvels of intellect and character .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 25]: It is by that sign and by that fact that I detect the resemblance here and know this portrait to be genuine and perfect .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 11]: Yes , all our family are fools at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 14]: `` This young man seems to meet the hereditary requirement , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 14]: `` Yes , yes , he was a fool , without any doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 13]: Examine the face , the shape of the head , the expression .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 13]: It 's all fool , fool , fool , straight through . ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 10]: `` Thanks , -- '' said Tracy , involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 4]: `` Thanks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 9]: `` I mean for explaining it to me .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 6]: Go on , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 15]: `` As I was saying , fool is printed all over the face . ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 10]: `` A body can even read the details . ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 7]: `` What do they say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 12]: `` Well , added up , he is a wobbler . ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 5]: `` A which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 3]: `` Wobbler .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 63]: A person that 's always taking a firm stand about something or other -- kind of a Gibraltar stand , he thinks , for unshakable fidelity and everlastingness -- and then , inside of a little while , he begins to wobble ; no more Gibraltar there ; no , sir , a mighty ordinary commonplace weakling wobbling -- around on stilts .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 17]: That 's Lord Berkeley to a dot , you can see it look at that sheep !
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 10]: But , -- why are you blushing like sunset !
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 12]: Dear sir , have I unwittingly offended in some way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 9]: `` Oh , no indeed , no indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 16]: But it always makes me blush to hear a man revile his own blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 19]: He said to himself , `` How strangely his vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 8]: By accident , he has described me .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 6]: I am that contemptible thing .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 38]: When I left England I thought I knew myself ; I thought I was a very Frederick the Great for resolution and staying capacity ; whereas in truth I am just a Wobbler , simply a Wobbler .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 29]: Well -- after all , it is at least creditable to have high ideals and give birth to lofty resolutions ; I will allow myself that comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 30]: Then he said , aloud , `` Could this sheep , as you call him , breed a great and self-sacrificing idea in his head , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 48]: Could he meditate such a thing , for instance , as the renunciation of the earldom and its wealth and its glories , and voluntary retirement to the ranks of the commonalty , there to rise by his own merit or remain forever poor and obscure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 4]: `` Could he ?
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 13]: Why , look at him -- look at this simpering self-righteous mug !
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 5]: There is your answer .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 10]: It 's the very thing he would think of .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 12]: And he would start in to do it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 5]: `` And then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 6]: `` He 'd wobble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 6]: `` And back down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 5]: `` Every time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 21]: `` Is that to happen with all my -- I mean would that happen to all his high resolutions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 6]: `` Oh certainly -- certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 8]: It 's the Rossmore of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 9]: `` Then this creature was fortunate to die !
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 24]: Suppose , for argument 's sake , that I was a Rossmore , and -- '' `` It ca n't be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 9]: `` Because it 's not a supposable case .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 23]: To be a Rossmore at your age , you 'd have to be a fool , and you 're not a fool .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 46]: And you 'd have to be a Wobbler , whereas anybody that is an expert in reading character can see at a glance that when you set your foot down once , it 's there to stay ; and earthquake ca n't wobble it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 25]: He added to himself , `` That 's enough to say to him , but it is n't half strong enough for the facts .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 15]: The more I observe him , now , the more remarkable I find him .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 10]: It is the strongest face I have ever examined .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 15]: There is almost superhuman firmness here , immovable purpose , iron steadfastness of will .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 7]: A most extraordinary young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 23]: He presently said , aloud : `` Some time I want to ask your advice about a little matter , Mr. Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 20]: You see , I 've got that young lord 's remaims -- my goodness , how you jump ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: `` Oh , it 's nothing , pray go on .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 7]: You 've got his remains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 15]: `` Are you sure they are his , and not somebody else 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 6]: `` Oh , perfectly sure .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 5]: Samples , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 6]: Not all of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 4]: `` Samples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 6]: `` Yes -- in baskets .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 22]: Some time you will be going home ; and if you would n't mind taking them along -- '' `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 3]: I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 5]: `` Yes -- certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 25]: I do n't mean now ; but after a while ; after -- but look here , would you like to see them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 4]: Most certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 9]: I do n't want to see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 6]: `` O , very well .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 14]: I only thought -- hey , where are you going , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 8]: `` Out to dinner , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 4]: Tracy was aghast .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 16]: The colonel said , in a disappointed voice : `` Well , I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 15]: Sho , I did n't know she was going out , Mr. Tracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 16]: Gwendolen 's face began to take on a sort of apprehensive ` What-have-I-done expression . '
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 24]: `` Three old people to one young one -- well , it is n't a good team , that 's a fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 48]: Gwendolen 's face betrayed a dawning hopefulness and she said -- with a tone of reluctance which had n't the hall-mark on it : `` If you prefer , I will send word to the Thompsons that I -- '' `` Oh , is it the Thompsons ?
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 8]: That simplifies it -- sets everything right .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 12]: We can fix it without spoiling your arrangements , my child .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 33]: You 've got your heart set on -- '' `` But papa , I 'd just as soon go there some other -- '' `` No -- I wo n't have it .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 40]: You are a good hard-working darling child , and your father is not the man to disappoint you when you -- '' `` But papa , I -- '' `` Go along , I wo n't hear a word .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 8]: We 'll get along , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 8]: Gwendolen was ready to cry with venation .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 81]: But there was nothing to do but start ; which she was about to do when her father hit upon an idea which filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the difficulties of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory : `` I 've got it , my love , so that you wo n't be robbed of your holiday and at the same time we 'll be pretty satisfactorily fixed for a good time here .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 61]: You send Belle Thompson here -- perfectly beautiful creature , Tracy , perfectly beautiful ; I want you to see that girl ; why , you 'll just go mad ; you 'll go mad inside of a minute ; yes , you send her right along , Gwendolen , and tell her -- why , she 's gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 12]: He turned -- she was already passing out at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 29]: He muttered , `` I wonder what 's the matter ; I do n't know what her mouth 's doing , but I think her shoulders are swearing .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 73]: Well , '' said Sellers blithely to Tracy , `` I shall miss her -- parents always miss the children as soon as they 're out of sight , it 's only a natural and wisely ordained partiality -- but you 'll be all right , because Miss Belle will supply the youthful element for you and to your entire content ; and we old people will do our best , too .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 8]: We shall have a good enough time .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 14]: And you 'll have a chance to get better acquainted with Admiral Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 22]: That 's a rare character , Mr. Tracy -- one of the rarest and most engaging characters the world has produced .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: You 'll find him worth studying .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: I 've studied him ever since he was a child and have always found him developing .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 41]: I really consider that one of the main things that has enabled me to master the difficult science of character-reading was the livid interest I always felt in that boy and the baffling inscrutabilities of his ways and inspirations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 7]: Tracy was not hearing a word .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 9]: His spirits were gone , he was desolate .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 8]: `` Yes , a most wonderful character .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 9]: Concealment -- that 's the basis of it .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 27]: Always the first thing you want to do is to find the keystone a man 's character is built on -- then you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: No misleading and apparently inconsistent peculiarities can fool you then .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 10]: What do you read on the Senator 's surface ?
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 26]: Simplicity ; a kind of rank and protuberant simplicity ; whereas , in fact , that 's one of the deepest minds in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 28]: A perfectly honest man -- an absolutely honest and honorable man -- and yet without doubt the profoundest master of dissimulation the world has ever seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 8]: `` O , it 's devilish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 26]: This was wrung from the unlistening Tracy by the anguished thought of what might have been if only the dinner arrangements had n't got mixed .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 36]: `` No , I should n't call it that , '' said Sellers , who was now placidly walking up and down the room with his hands under his coat-tails and listening to himself talk .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 18]: `` One could quite properly call it devilish in another man , but not in the Senator .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 18]: Your term is right -- perfectly right -- I grant that -- but the application is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 6]: It makes a great difference .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 8]: Yes , he is a marvelous character .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 26]: I do not suppose that any other statesman ever had such a colossal sense of humor , combined with the ability to totally conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 19]: I may except George Washington and Cromwell , and perhaps Robespierre , but I draw the line there .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 30]: A person not an expert might be in Judge Hawkins 's company a lifetime and never find out he had any more sense of humor than a cemetery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 24]: A deep-drawn yard-long sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist , followed by a murmured , `` Miserable , oh , miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 15]: `` Well , no , I should n't say that about it , quite .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 28]: On the contrary , I admire his ability to conceal his humor even more if possible than I admire the gift itself , stupendous as it is .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 26]: Another thing -- General Hawkins is a thinker ; a keen , logical , exhaustive , analytical thinker -- perhaps the ablest of modern times .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 57]: That is , of course , upon themes suited to his size , like the glacial period , and the correlation of forces , and the evolution of the Christian from the caterpillar -- any of those things ; give him a subject according to his size , and just stand back and watch him think !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 8]: Why you can see the place rock !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 18]: Ah , yes , you must know him ; you must get on the inside of him .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 9]: Perhaps the most extraordinary mind since Aristotle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 38]: Dinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thompson , but as Gwendolen had not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good , and the household presently went to the meal without her .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 167]: Poor old Sellers tried everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion an enjoyable one for the guest , and the guest tried his honest best to be cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentleman 's sake ; in fact all hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time , but the thing was a failure from the start ; Tracy 's heart was lead in his bosom , there seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape and that was a vacant chair , he could n't drag his mind away from Gwendolen and his hard luck ; consequently his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in every now and then when it was his turn to say something , and of course this disease spread to the rest of the conversation -- wherefore , instead of having a breezy sail in sunny waters , as anticipated , everybody was bailing out and praying for land .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 6]: What could the matter be ?
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 15]: Tracy alone could have told , the others could n't even invent a theory .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 19]: Meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the Thompson house ; in fact a twin experience .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 43]: Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for allowing her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her so strangely and profoundly miserable ; but feeling ashamed of herself did n't improve the matter any ; it only seemed to aggravate the suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 35]: She explained that she was not feeling very well , and everybody could see that this was true ; so she got sincere sympathy and commiseration ; but that did n't help the case .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 8]: Nothing helps that kind of a case .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 12]: It is best to just stand off and let it fester .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 31]: The moment the dinner was over the girl excused herself , and she hurried home feeling unspeakably grateful to get away from that house and that intolerable captivity and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 5]: Will he be gone ?
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 14]: The thought arose in her brain , but took effect in her heels .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 18]: She slipped into the house , threw off her things and made straight for the dining room .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 5]: She stopped and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 33]: Her father 's voice -- with no life in it ; presently her mother 's -- no life in that ; a considerable vacancy , then a sterile remark from Washington Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 15]: Another silence ; then , not Tracy 's but her father 's voice again .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 21]: `` He 's gone , '' she said to herself despairingly , and listlessly opened the door and stepped within .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 17]: `` Why , my child , '' cried the mother , `` how white you are !
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 11]: Are you -- has anything -- '' `` White ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 3]: exclaimed Sellers .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 13]: `` It 's gone like a flash ; 't was n't serious .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 12]: Already she 's as red as the soul of a watermelon !
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 14]: Sit down , dear , sit down -- goodness knows you 're welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 7]: Did you have a good time ?
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 9]: We 've had great times here -- immense .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 7]: Why did n't Miss Belle come ?
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 17]: Mr. Tracy is not feeling well , and she 'd have made him forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 32]: She was content now ; and out from her happy eyes there went a light that told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in return .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 22]: In just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two great confessions were made , received , and perfectly understood .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 24]: All anxiety , apprehension , uncertainty , vanished out of these young people 's hearts and left them filled with a great peace .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 32]: Sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat , but it was an error .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 9]: The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 35]: He was proud of Gwendolen , and liked to show her off , even against Miss Belle Thompson , and here had been a great opportunity , and what had she made of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 8]: He felt a good deal put out .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 77]: It vexed him to think that this Englishman , with the traveling Briton 's everlasting disposition to generalize whole mountain ranges from single sample-grains of sand , would jump to the conclusion that American girls were as dumb as himself -- generalizing the whole tribe from this single sample and she at her poorest , there being nothing at that table to inspire her , give her a start , keep her from going to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 26]: He made up his mind that for the honor of the country he would bring these two together again over the social board before long .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 12]: There would be a different result another time , he judged .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 46]: He said to himself , with a deep sense of injury , `` He 'll put in his diary -- they all keep diaries -- he 'll put in his diary that she was miraculously uninteresting -- dear , dear , but was n't she !
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 38]: I never saw the like -- and yet looking as beautiful as Satan , too -- and could n't seem to do anything but paw bread crumbs , and pick flowers to pieces , and look fidgety .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 13]: And it is n't any better here in the Hall of Audience .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 24]: I 've had enough ; I 'll haul down my flag -- the others may fight it out if they want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 18]: He shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said was pressing .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 19]: The idolaters were the width of the room apart ; and apparently unconscious of each other 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 9]: The distance got shortened a little , now .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 6]: Very soon the mother withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 5]: The distance narrowed again .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 47]: Tracy stood before a chromo of some Ohio politician which had been retouched and chain-mailed for a crusading Rossmore , and Gwendolen was sitting on the sofa not far from his elbow artificially absorbed in examining a photograph album that had n't any photographs in it .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 7]: The `` Senator '' still lingered .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 17]: He was sorry for the young people ; it had been a dull evening for them .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 40]: In the goodness of his heart he tried to make it pleasant for them now ; tried to remove the ill impression necessarily left by the general defeat ; tried to be chatty , even tried to be gay .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 33]: But the responses were sickly , there was no starting any enthusiasm ; he would give it up and quit -- it was a day specially picked out and consecrated to failures .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 24]: But when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said with thankfulness and blessing , `` Must you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 12]: it seemed cruel to desert , and he sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 14]: He was about to begin a remark when -- when he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 6]: We have all been there .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 31]: He did n't know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had been a mistake , he merely knew it ; and knew it for dead certain , too .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 24]: And so he bade goodnight , and went mooning out , wondering what he could have done that changed the atmosphere that way .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 35]: As the door closed behind him those two were standing side by side , looking at that door -- looking at it in a waiting , second-counting , but deeply grateful kind of way .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 38]: And the instant it closed they flung their arms about each other 's necks , and there , heart to heart and lip to lip -- `` Oh , my God , she 's kissing it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 22]: Nobody heard this remark , because Hawkins , who bred it , only thought it , he did n't utter it .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 39]: He had turned , the moment he had closed the door , and had pushed it open a little , intending to re-enter and ask what ill-advised thing he had done or said , and apologize for it .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: But he did n't re-enter ; he staggered off stunned , terrified , distressed .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 32]: Five minutes later he was sitting in his room , with his head bowed within the circle of his arms , on the table -- final attitude of grief and despair .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 17]: His tears were flowing fast , and now and then a sob broke upon the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 48]: Presently he said : `` I knew her when she was a little child and used to climb about my knees ; I love her as I love my own , and now -- oh , poor thing , poor thing , I can not bear it !
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 13]: -- she 's gone and lost her heart to this mangy materializee !
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 10]: Why did n't we see that that might happen ?
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 5]: But how could we ?
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 13]: Nobody could ; nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 14]: You could n't expect a person would fall in love with a wax-work .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 11]: And this one does n't even amount to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 17]: He went on grieving to himself , and now and then giving voice to his lamentations .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 25]: `` It 's done , oh , it 's done , and there 's no help for it , no undoing the miserable business .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 11]: If I had the nerve , I would kill it .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 8]: But that would n't do any good .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 12]: She loves it ; she thinks it 's genuine and authentic .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 18]: If she lost it she would grieve for it just as she would for a real person .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 10]: And who 's to break it to the family !
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 8]: Not I -- I 'll die first .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 34]: Sellers is the best human being I ever knew and I would n't any more think of -- oh , dear , why it 'll break his heart when he finds it out .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 5]: And Polly 's too .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 9]: This comes of meddling with such infernal matters !
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 16]: But for this , the creature would still be roasting in Sheol where it belongs .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 12]: How is it that these people do n't smell the brimstone ?
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 16]: Sometimes I ca n't come into the same room with him without nearly suffocating . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 18]: After a while he broke out again : `` Well , there 's one thing , sure .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 11]: The materializing has got to stop right where it is .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 49]: If she 's got to marry a spectre , let her marry a decent one out of the Middle Ages , like this one -- not a cowboy and a thief such as this protoplasmic tadpole 's going to turn into if Sellers keeps on fussing at it .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 33]: It costs five thousand dollars cash and shuts down on the incorporated company to stop the works at this point , but Sally Sellers 's happiness is worth more than that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 11]: He heard Sellers coming , and got himself to rights .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 23]: Sellers took a seat , and said : `` Well , I 've got to confess I 'm a good deal puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 12]: It did certainly eat , there 's no getting around it .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 29]: Not eat , exactly , either , but it nibbled ; nibbled in an appetiteless way , but still it nibbled ; and that 's just a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 13]: Now the question is , what does it do with those nibblings ?
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 11]: That 's it -- what does it do with them ?
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 19]: My idea is that we do n't begin to know all there is to this stupendous discovery yet .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 21]: But time will show -- time and science -- give us a chance , and do n't get impatient . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 27]: But he could n't get Hawkins interested ; could n't make him talk to amount to anything ; could n't drag him out of his depression .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 13]: But at last he took a turn that arrested Hawkins 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 10]: `` I 'm coming to like him , Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 11]: He is a person of stupendous character -- absolutely gigantic .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 26]: Under that placid exterior is concealed the most dare-devil spirit that was ever put into a man -- he 's just a Clive over again .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 24]: Yes , I 'm all admiration for him , on account of his character , and liking naturally follows admiration , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 8]: I 'm coming to like him immensely .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 57]: Do you know , I have n't the heart to degrade such a character as that down to the burglar estate for money or for anything else ; and I 've come to ask if you are willing to let the reward go , and leave this poor fellow -- '' `` Where he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 11]: `` Yes -- not bring him down to date . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 18]: `` Oh , there 's my hand ; and my heart 's in it , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 27]: `` I 'll never forget you for this , Hawkins , '' said the old gentleman in a voice which he found it hard to control .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 43]: `` You are making a great sacrifice for me , and one which you can ill afford , but I 'll never forget your generosity , and if I live you shall not suffer for it , be sure of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 68]: Sally Sellers immediately and vividly realized that she was become a new being ; a being of a far higher and worthier sort than she had been such a little while before ; an earnest being , in place of a dreamer ; and supplied with a reason for her presence in the world , where merely a wistful and troubled curiosity about it had existed before .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 87]: So great and so comprehensive was the change which had been wrought , that she seemed to herself to be a real person who had lately been a shadow ; a something which had lately been a nothing ; a purpose , which had lately been a fancy ; a finished temple , with the altar-fires lit and the voice of worship ascending , where before had been but an architect 's confusion of arid working plans , unintelligible to the passing eye and prophesying nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 5]: `` Lady '' Gwendolen !
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 18]: The pleasantness of that sound was all gone ; it was an offense to her ear now .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 24]: She said : `` There -- that sham belongs to the past ; I will not be called by it any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 8]: `` I may call you simply Gwendolen ?
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 21]: You will allow me to drop the formalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without additions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 12]: She was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 7]: `` There -- that is better .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 7]: I hate pinks -- some pinks .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 41]: Indeed yes , you are to call me by my first name without additions -- that is , -- well , I do n't mean without additions entirely , but -- '' It was as far as she could get .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 37]: There was a pause ; his intellect was struggling to comprehend ; presently it did manage to catch the idea in time to save embarrassment all around , and he said gratefully -- `` Dear Gwendolen !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 6]: I may say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 7]: `` Yes -- part of it .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 22]: But -- do n't kiss me when I am talking , it makes me forget what I was going to say .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 16]: You can call me by part of that form , but not the last part .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 7]: Gwendolen is not my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 6]: `` Not your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 9]: This in a tone of wonder and surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 21]: The girl 's soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy apprehension , a quite definite sense of suspicion and alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 27]: She put his arms away from her , looked him searchingly in the eye , and said : `` Answer me truly , on your honor .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 14]: You are not seeking to marry me on account of my rank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 17]: The shot almost knocked him through the wall , he was so little prepared for it .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 30]: There was something so finely grotesque about the question and its parent suspicion , that he stopped to wonder and admire , and thus was he saved from laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 72]: Then , without wasting precious time , he set about the task of convincing her that he had been lured by herself alone , and had fallen in love with her only , not her title and position ; that he loved her with all his heart , and could not love her more if she were a duchess , or less if she were without home , name or family .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 47]: She watched his face wistfully , eagerly , hopefully , translating his words by its expression ; and when he had finished there was gladness in her heart -- a tumultuous gladness , indeed , though outwardly she was calm , tranquil , even judicially austere .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 72]: She prepared a surprise for him , now , calculated to put a heavy strain upon those disinterested protestations of his ; and thus she delivered it , burning it away word by word as the fuse burns down to a bombshell , and watching to see how far the explosion would lift him : `` Listen -- and do not doubt me , for I shall speak the exact truth .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 16]: Howard Tracy , I am no more an earl 's child than you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 15]: To her joy -- and secret surprise , also -- it never phased him .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 12]: He was ready , this time , and saw his chance .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: He cried out with enthusiasm , `` Thank heaven for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 7]: and gathered her to his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 12]: To express her happiness was almost beyond her gift of speech .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 24]: `` You make me the proudest girl in all the earth , '' she said , with her head pillowed on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 83]: `` I thought it only natural that you should be dazzled by the title -- maybe even unconsciously , you being English -- and that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved only me , and find you did n't love me when the deception was swept away ; so it makes me proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that you do love just me , only me -- oh , prouder than any words can tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 20]: `` It is only you , sweetheart , I never gave one envying glance toward your father 's earldom .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 9]: That is utterly true , dear Gwendolen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 10]: `` There -- you must n't call me that .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 6]: I hate that false name .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 8]: I told you it was n't mine .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 13]: My name is Sally Sellers -- or Sarah , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 18]: From this time I banish dreams , visions , imaginings , and will no more of them .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 34]: I am going to be myself -- my genuine self , my honest self , my natural self , clear and clean of sham and folly and fraud , and worthy of you .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 46]: There is no grain of social inequality between us ; I , like you , am poor ; I , like you , am without position or distinction ; you are a struggling artist , I am that , too , in my humbler way .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 12]: Our bread is honest bread , we work for our living .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 43]: Hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave , helping each other in all ways , living for each other , being and remaining one in heart and purpose , one in hope and aspiration , inseparable to the end .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 42]: And though our place is low , judged by the world 's eye , we will make it as high as the highest in the great essentials of honest work for what we eat and wear , and conduct above reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 38]: We live in a land , let us be thankful , where this is all-sufficient , and no man is better than his neighbor by the grace of God , but only by his own merit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 16]: Tracy tried to break in , but she stopped him and kept the floor herself .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 7]: `` I am not through yet .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 32]: I am going to purge myself of the last vestiges of artificiality and pretence , and then start fair on your own honest level and be worthy mate to you thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: My father honestly thinks he is an earl .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 27]: Well , leave him his dream , it pleases him and does no one any harm : It was the dream of his ancestors before him .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 28]: It has made fools of the house of Sellers for generations , and it made something of a fool of me , but took no deep root .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 11]: I am done with it now , and for good .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 54]: Forty-eight hours ago I was privately proud of being the daughter of a pinchbeck earl , and thought the proper mate for me must be a man of like degree ; but to-day -- oh , how grateful I am for your love which has healed my sick brain and restored my sanity !
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 39]: -- I could make oath that no earl 's son in all the world -- '' `` Oh , -- well , but -- but -- '' `` Why , you look like a person in a panic .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 6]: What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 3]: `` Matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 6]: Oh , nothing -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 54]: I was only going to say '' -- but in his flurry nothing occurred to him to say , for a moment ; then by a lucky inspiration he thought of something entirely sufficient for the occasion , and brought it out with eloquent force : `` Oh , how beautiful you are !
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 12]: You take my breath away when you look like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 18]: It was well conceived , well timed , and cordially delivered -- and it got its reward .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 5]: `` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 4]: Where was I ?
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 10]: Yes , my father 's earldom is pure moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: Look at those dreadful things on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 17]: You have of course supposed them to be portraits of his ancestors , earls of Rossmore .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 6]: Well , they are not .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 23]: They are chromos of distinguished Americans -- all moderns ; but he has carried them back a thousand years by re-labeling them .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 56]: Andrew Jackson there , is doing what he can to be the late American earl ; and the newest treasure in the collection is supposed to be the young English heir -- I mean the idiot with the crape ; but in truth it 's a shoemaker , and not Lord Berkeley at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 7]: `` Why of course I am .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 8]: He would n't look like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 23]: `` Because his conduct in his last moments , when the fire was sweeping around him shows that he was a man .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 13]: It shows that he was a fine , high-souled young creature . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 29]: Tracy was strongly moved by these compliments , and it seemed to him that the girl 's lovely lips took on anew loveliness when they were delivering them .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 44]: He said , softly : `` It is a pity he could not know what a gracious impression his behavior was going to leave with the dearest and sweetest stranger in the land of -- '' `` Oh , I almost loved him !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 9]: Why , I think of him every day .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 10]: He is always floating about in my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 12]: Tracy felt that this was a little more than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 9]: He was conscious of the sting of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 52]: He said : `` It is quite right to think of him -- at least now and then -- that is , at intervals -- in perhaps an admiring way -- but it seems to me that -- '' `` Howard Tracy , are you jealous of that dead man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 12]: He was ashamed -- and at the same time not ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 14]: He was jealous -- and at the same time he was not jealous .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 29]: In a sense the dead man was himself ; in that case compliments and affection lavished upon that corpse went into his own till and were clear profit .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 31]: But in another sense the dead man was not himself ; and in that case all compliments and affection lavished there were wasted , and a sufficient basis for jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 12]: A tiff was the result of the dispute between the two .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 13]: Then they made it up , and were more loving than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 63]: As an affectionate clincher of the reconciliation , Sally declared that she had now banished Lord Berkeley from her mind ; and added , `` And in order to make sure that he shall never make trouble between us again , I will teach myself to detest that name and all that have ever borne it or ever shall bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 49]: This inflicted another pang , and Tracy was minded to ask her to modify that a little just on general principles , and as practice in not overdoing a good thing -- perhaps he might better leave things as they were and not risk bringing on another tiff .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 15]: He got away from that particular , and sought less tender ground for conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 25]: `` I suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities , now that you have renounced your title and your father 's earldom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 4]: `` Real ones ?
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 17]: Oh , dear no -- but I 've thrown aside our sham one for good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 30]: This answer fell just at the right time and just in the right place , to save the poor unstable young man from changing his political complexion once more .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 30]: He had been on the point of beginning to totter again , but this prop shored him up and kept him from floundering back into democracy and re-renouncing aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 13]: So he went home glad that he had asked the fortunate question .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 21]: The girl would accept a little thing like a genuine earldom , she was merely prejudiced against the brummagem article .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 21]: Yes , he could have his girl and have his earldom , too : that question was a fortunate stroke .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 88]: Sally went to bed happy , too ; and remained happy , deliriously happy , for nearly two hours ; but at last , just as she was sinking into a contented and luxurious unconsciousness , the shady devil who lives and lurks and hides and watches inside of human beings and is always waiting for a chance to do the proprietor a malicious damage , whispered to her soul and said , `` That question had a harmless look , but what was back of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 9]: -- what was the secret motive of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 6]: -- what suggested it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 27]: The shady devil had knifed her , and could retire , now , and take a rest ; the wound would attend to business for him .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 4]: And it did .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 8]: Why should Howard Tracy ask that question ?
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 23]: If he was not trying to marry her for the sake of her rank , what should suggest that question to him ?
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 17]: Did n't he plainly look gratified when she said her objections to aristocracy had their limitations ?
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 20]: Ah , he is after that earldom , that gilded sham -- it is n't poor me he wants .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 9]: So she argued , in anguish and tears .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 22]: Then she argued the opposite theory , but made a weak , poor business of it , and lost the case .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 65]: She kept the arguing up , one side and then the other , the rest of the night , and at last fell asleep at dawn ; fell in the fire at dawn , one may say ; for that kind of sleep resembles fire , and one comes out of it with his brain baked and his physical forces fried out of him .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 10]: Tracy wrote his father before he sought his bed .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 171]: He wrote a letter which he believed would get better treatment than his cablegram received , for it contained what ought to be welcome news ; namely , that he had tried equality and working for a living ; had made a fight which he could find no reason to be ashamed of , and in the matter of earning a living had proved that he was able to do it ; but that on the whole he had arrived at the conclusion that he could not reform the world single-handed , and was willing to retire from the conflict with the fair degree of honor which he had gained , and was also willing to return home and resume his position and be content with it and thankful for it for the future , leaving further experiment of a missionary sort to other young people needing the chastening and quelling persuasions of experience , the only logic sure to convince a diseased imagination and restore it to rugged health .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 25]: Then he approached the subject of marriage with the daughter of the American Claimant with a good deal of caution and much painstaking art .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 22]: He said praiseful and appreciative things about the girl , but did n't dwell upon that detail or make it prominent .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 42]: The thing which he made prominent was the opportunity now so happily afforded , to reconcile York and Lancaster , graft the warring roses upon one stem , and end forever a crying injustice which had already lasted far too long .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 42]: One could infer that he had thought this thing all out and chosen this way of making all things fair and right because it was sufficiently fair and considerably wiser than the renunciation-scheme which he had brought with him from England .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 12]: One could infer that , but he did n't say it .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 19]: In fact the more he read his letter over , the more he got to inferring it himself .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 41]: When the old earl received that letter , the first part of it filled him with a grim and snarly satisfaction ; but the rest of it brought a snort or two out of him that could be translated differently .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 27]: He wasted no ink in this emergency , either in cablegrams or letters ; he promptly took ship for America to look into the matter himself .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 63]: He had staunchly held his grip all this long time , and given no sign of the hunger at his heart to see his son ; hoping for the cure of his insane dream , and resolute that the process should go through all the necessary stages without assuaging telegrams or other nonsense from home , and here was victory at last .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 11]: Victory , but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage project .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 15]: Yes , he would step over and take a hand in this matter himself .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 42]: During the first ten days following the mailing of the letter Tracy 's spirits had no idle time ; they were always climbing up into the clouds or sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation reached .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 17]: He was intensely happy or intensely miserable by turns , according to Miss Sally 's moods .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 28]: He never could tell when the mood was going to change , and when it changed he could n't tell what it was that had changed it .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 65]: Sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was tropical , torrid , and she could find no language fervent enough for its expression ; then suddenly , and without warning or any apparent reason , the weather would change , and the victim would find himself adrift among the icebergs and feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north pole .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 21]: It sometimes seemed to him that a man might better be dead than exposed to these devastating varieties of climate .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 5]: The case was simple .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 41]: Sally wanted to believe that Tracy 's preference was disinterested ; so she was always applying little tests of one sort or another , hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence which would confirm or fortify her belief .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 28]: Poor Tracy did not know that these experiments were being made upon him , consequently he walked promptly into all the traps the girl set for him .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 20]: These traps consisted in apparently casual references to social distinction , aristocratic title and privilege , and such things .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 25]: Often Tracy responded to these references heedlessly and not much caring what he said provided it kept the talk going and prolonged the seance .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 51]: He did n't suspect that the girl was watching his face and listening for his words as one who watches the judge 's face and listens for the words which will restore him to home and friends and freedom or shut him away from the sun and human companionship forever .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 38]: He did n't suspect that his careless words were being weighed , and so he often delivered sentence of death when it would have been just as handy and all the same to him to pronounce acquittal .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 18]: Daily he broke the girl 's heart , nightly he sent her to the rack for sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 6]: He could n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 30]: Some people would have put this and that together and perceived that the weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced , and that then it always changed .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 24]: And they would have looked further , and perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party , never the other .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 15]: They would have argued , then , that this was done for a purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 21]: If they could not find out what that purpose was in any simpler or easier way , they would ask .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 15]: But Tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough to think of these things .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 17]: He noticed only one particular ; that the weather was always sunny when a visit began .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 18]: No matter how much it might cloud up later , it always began with a clear sky .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 19]: He could n't explain this curious fact to himself , he merely knew it to be a fact .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 70]: The truth of the matter was , that by the time Tracy had been out of Sally 's sight six hours she was so famishing for a sight of him that her doubts and suspicions were all consumed away in the fire of that longing , and so always she came into his presence as surprisingly radiant and joyous as she was n't when she went out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 13]: In circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 36]: The portrait of Sellers , by Tracy , was fighting along , day by day , through this mixed weather , and daily adding to itself ineradicable signs of the checkered life it was leading .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 46]: It was the happiest portrait , in spots , that was ever seen ; but in other spots a damned soul looked out from it ; a soul that was suffering all the different kinds of distress there are , from stomach ache to rabies .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 5]: But Sellers liked it .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 24]: He said it was just himself all over -- a portrait that sweated moods from every pore , and no two moods alike .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 16]: He said he had as many different kinds of emotions in him as a jug .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 81]: It was a kind of a deadly work of art , maybe , but it was a starchy picture for show ; for it was life size , full length , and represented the American earl in a peer 's scarlet robe , with the three ermine bars indicative of an earl 's rank , and on the gray head an earl 's coronet , tilted just a wee bit to one side in a most gallus and winsome way .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 30]: When Sally 's weather was sunny the portrait made Tracy chuckle , but when her weather was overcast it disordered his mind and stopped the circulation of his blood .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 35]: Late one night when the sweethearts had been having a flawless visit together , Sally 's interior devil began to work his specialty , and soon the conversation was drifting toward the customary rock .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 35]: Presently , in the midst of Tracy 's serene flow of talk , he felt a shudder which he knew was not his shudder , but exterior to his breast although immediately against it .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 10]: After the shudder came sobs ; Sally was crying .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 16]: `` Oh , my darling , what have I done -- what have I said ?
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 5]: It has happened again !
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 9]: What have I done to wound you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: She disengaged herself from his arms and gave him a look of deep reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 6]: `` What have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 9]: I will tell you what you have done .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 24]: You have unwittingly revealed -- oh , for the twentieth time , though I could not believe it , would not believe it !
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 27]: -- that it is not me you love , but that foolish sham my father 's imitation earldom ; and you have broken my heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 11]: `` Oh , my child , what are you saying !
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 9]: I never dreamed of such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 26]: `` Oh , Howard , Howard , the things you have uttered when you were forgetting to guard your tongue , have betrayed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 14]: `` Things I have uttered when I was forgetting to guard my tongue ?
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 5]: These are hard words .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 8]: When have I remembered to guard it ?
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 5]: Never in one instance .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: It has no office but to speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 8]: It needs no guarding for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 34]: `` Howard , I have noted your words and weighed them , when you were not thinking of their significance -- and they have told me more than you meant they should . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 41]: `` Do you mean to say you have answered the trust I had in you by using it as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting tongue and be safe from detection while you did it ?
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 14]: You have not done this -- surely you have not done this thing .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 11]: Oh , one 's enemy could not do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 17]: This was an aspect of the girl 's conduct which she had not clearly perceived before .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 4]: Was it treachery ?
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 6]: Had she abused a trust ?
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 10]: The thought crimsoned her cheeks with shame and remorse .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 20]: `` Oh , forgive me , '' she said , `` I did not know what I was doing .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 38]: I have been so tortured -- you will forgive me , you must ; I have suffered so much , and I am so sorry and so humble ; you do forgive me , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 114]: -- do n't turn away , do n't refuse me ; it is only my love that is at fault , and you know I love you , love you with all my heart ; I could n't bear to -- oh , dear , dear , I am so miserable , and I sever meant any harm , and I did n't see where this insanity was carrying me , and how it was wronging and abusing the dearest heart in all the world to me -- and -- and -- oh , take me in your arms again , I have no other refuge , no other home and hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 17]: There was reconciliation again -- immediate , perfect , all-embracing -- and with it utter happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 10]: This would have been a good time to adjourn .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 71]: But no , now that the cloud-breeder was revealed at last ; now that it was manifest that all the sour weather had come from this girl 's dread that Tracy was lured by her rank and not herself , he resolved to lay that ghost immediately and permanently by furnishing the best possible proof that he could n't have had back of him at any time the suspected motive .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 30]: So he said : `` Let me whisper a little secret in your ear -- a secret which I have kept shut up in my breast all this time .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 10]: Your rank could n't ever have been an enticement .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 11]: I am son and heir to an English earl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 26]: The girl stared at him -- one , two , three moments , maybe a dozen -- then her lips parted : `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 20]: she said , and moved away from him , still gazing at him in a kind of blank amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 9]: `` Why -- why , certainly I am .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 7]: Why do you act like this ?
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 7]: What have I done now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 6]: `` What have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 9]: You have certainly made a most strange statement .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 7]: You must see that yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 32]: `` Well , '' with a timid little laugh , `` it may be a strange enough statement ; but of what consequence is that , if it is true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 6]: `` If it is true .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 8]: You are already retiring from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 8]: `` Oh , not for a moment !
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 6]: You should not say that .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: I have not deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 13]: I have spoken the truth ; why do you doubt it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 5]: Her reply was prompt .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 11]: `` Simply because you did n't speak it earlier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 32]: It was n't a groan , exactly , but it was an intelligible enough expression of the fact that he saw the point and recognized that there was reason in it .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 52]: `` You have seemed to conceal nothing from me that I ought to know concerning yourself , and you were not privileged to keep back such a thing as this from me a moment after -- after -- well , after you had determined to pay your court to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 12]: `` Its true , it 's true , I know it !
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 21]: But there were circumstances -- in -- in the way -- circumstances which -- '' She waved the circumstances aside .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 55]: `` Well , you see , '' he said , pleadingly , `` you seemed so bent on our traveling the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty , that I was terrified -- that is , I was afraid -- of -- of -- well , you know how you talked . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 9]: `` Yes , I know how I talked .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 30]: And I also know that before the talk was finished you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies , and my answer was calculated to relieve your fears . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 6]: He was silent a while .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 20]: Then he said , in a discouraged way : `` I do n't see any way out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 5]: It was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 12]: That is in truth all it was , just a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 11]: No harm was meant , no harm in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: I did n't see how it might some time look .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 5]: It is my way .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 9]: I do n't seem to see far . ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 10]: The girl was almost disarmed , for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 6]: Then she flared up again .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 6]: `` An Earl 's son !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 17]: Do earls ' sons go about working in lowly callings for their bread and butter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 7]: `` God knows they do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 7]: I have wished they did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 57]: `` Do earls ' sons sink their degree in a country like this , and come sober and decent to sue for the hand of a born child of poverty when they can go drunk , profane , and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy the pick and choice of the millionaires ' daughters of America ?
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 6]: You an earl 's son !
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 6]: Show me the signs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 15]: `` I thank God I am not able -- if those are the signs .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 11]: But yet I am an earl 's son and heir .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: It is all I can say .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 12]: I wish you would believe me , but you will not .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 9]: I know no way to persuade you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 37]: She was about to soften again , but his closing remark made her bring her foot down with smart vexation , and she cried out : `` Oh , you drive all patience out of me !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 23]: Would you have one believe that you have n't your proofs at hand , and yet are what you say you are ?
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 17]: You do not put your hand in your pocket now -- for you have nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 15]: You make a claim like this , and then venture to travel without credentials .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 5]: These are simply incredibilities .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 9]: Do n't you see that , yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 57]: He cast about in his mind for a defence of some kind or other -- hesitated a little , and then said , with difficulty and diffidence : `` I will tell you just the truth , foolish as it will seem to you -- to anybody , I suppose -- but it is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 90]: I had an ideal -- call it a dream , a folly , if you will -- but I wanted to renounce the privileges and unfair advantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from the nation by force and fraud , and purge myself of my share of those crimes against right and reason , by thenceforth comrading with the poor and humble on equal terms , earning with my own hands the bread I ate , and rising by my own merit if I rose at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 75]: The young girl scanned his face narrowly while he spoke ; and there was something about his simplicity of manner and statement which touched her -- touched her almost to the danger point ; but she set her grip on the yielding spirit and choked it to quiescence ; it could not be wise to surrender to compassion or any kind of sentiment , yet ; she must ask one or two more questions .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 18]: Tracy was reading her face ; and what he read there lifted his drooping hopes a little .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 9]: `` An earl 's son to do that !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 7]: Why , he were a man !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 5]: A man to love !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 11]: -- oh , more , a man to worship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 6]: `` But he never lived !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 11]: He is not born , he will not be born .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 45]: The self-abnegation that could do that -- even in utter folly , and hopeless of conveying benefit to any , beyond the mere example -- could be mistaken for greatness ; why , it would be greatness in this cold age of sordid ideals !
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 15]: A moment -- wait -- let me finish ; I have one question more .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 8]: Your father is earl of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 10]: `` Rossmore -- and I am Viscount Berkeley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 8]: The fat was in the fire again .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 14]: The girl felt so outraged that it was difficult for her to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 10]: `` How can you venture such a brazen thing !
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 15]: You know that he is dead , and you know that I know it .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 39]: Oh , to rob the living of name and honors for a selfish and temporary advantage is crime enough , but to rob the defenceless dead -- why it is more than crime , it degrades crime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 18]: `` Oh , listen to me -- just a word -- do n't turn away like that .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 15]: Do n't go -- do n't leave me , so -- stay one moment .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 13]: On my honor -- '' `` Oh , on your honor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 10]: `` On my honor I am what I say !
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 16]: And I will prove it , and you will believe , I know you will .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 15]: I will bring you a message -- a cablegram -- '' `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 14]: `` To-morrow -- next day -- '' `` Signed ` Rossmore ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 7]: `` Yes -- signed Rossmore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 7]: `` What will that prove ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 6]: `` What will it prove ?
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 6]: What should it prove ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 18]: `` If you force me to say it -- possibly the presence of a confederate somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 10]: This was a hard blow , and staggered him .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 10]: He said , dejectedly : `` It is true .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 7]: I did not think of it .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 19]: Oh , my God , I do not know any way to do ; I do everything wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 4]: You are going ?
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 12]: -- and you wo n't say even good-night -- or good-bye ?
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: Ah , we have not parted like this before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 16]: `` Oh , I want to run and -- no , go , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 18]: A pause -- then she said , `` You may bring the message when it comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 6]: `` Oh , may I ?
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 5]: God bless you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 21]: He was gone ; and none too soon ; her lips were already quivering , and now she broke down .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 11]: Through her sobbings her words broke from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 7]: `` Oh , he is gone .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: I have lost him , I shall never see him any more .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 52]: And he did n't kiss me good-bye ; never even offered to force a kiss from me , and he knowing it was the very , very last , and I expecting he would , and never dreaming he would treat me so after all we have been to each other .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 18]: Oh , oh , oh , oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 27]: He is a dear , poor , miserable , good-hearted , transparent liar and humbug , but oh , I do love him so -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 9]: After a little she broke into speech again .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 6]: `` How dear he is !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 13]: and I shall miss him so , I shall miss him so !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 14]: Why wo n't he ever think to forge a message and fetch it ?
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 28]: -- but no , he never will , he never thinks of anything ; he 's so honest and simple it would n't ever occur to him .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 29]: Oh , what did possess him to think he could succeed as a fraud -- and he has n't the first requisite except duplicity that I can see .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 15]: Oh , dear , I 'll go to bed and give it all up .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 36]: Oh , I wish I had told him to come and tell me whenever he did n't get any telegram -- and now it 's all my own fault if I never see him again .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 7]: How my eyes must look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 12]: Next day , sure enough , the cablegram did n't come .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 30]: This was an immense disaster ; for Tracy could n't go into the presence without that ticket , although it was n't going to possess any value as evidence .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 38]: But if the failure of the cablegram on that first day may be called an immense disaster , where is the dictionary that can turn out a phrase sizeable enough to describe the tenth day 's failure ?
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 71]: Of course every day that the cablegram did n't come made Tracy all of twenty-four hours ' more ashamed of himself than he was the day before , and made Sally fully twenty-four hours more certain than ever that he not only had n't any father anywhere , but had n't even a confederate -- and so it followed that he was a double-dyed humbug and could n't be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 11]: These were hard days for Barrow and the art firm .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 12]: All these had their hands full , trying to comfort Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 48]: Barrow 's task was particularly hard , because he was made a confidant in full , and therefore had to humor Tracy 's delusion that he had a father , and that the father was an earl , and that he was going to send a cablegram .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 40]: Barrow early gave up the idea of trying to convince Tracy that he had n't any father , because this had such a bad effect on the patient , and worked up his temper to such an alarming degree .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 132]: He had tried , as an experiment , letting Tracy think he had a father ; the result was so good that he went further , with proper caution , and tried letting him think his father was an earl ; this wrought so well , that he grew bold , and tried letting him think he had two fathers , if he wanted to , but he did n't want to , so Barrow withdrew one of them and substituted letting him think he was going to get a cablegram -- which Barrow judged he would n't , and was right ; but Barrow worked the cablegram daily for all it was worth , and it was the one thing that kept Tracy alive ; that was Barrow 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 18]: And these were bitter hard days for poor Sally , and mainly delivered up to private crying .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 37]: She kept her furniture pretty damp , and so caught cold , and the dampness and the cold and the sorrow together undermined her appetite , and she was a pitiful enough object , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 32]: Her state was bad enough , as per statement of it above quoted ; but all the forces of nature and circumstance seemed conspiring to make it worse -- and succeeding .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 223]: For instance , the morning after her dismissal of Tracy , Hawkins and Sellers read in the associated press dispatches that a toy puzzle called Pigs in the Clover , had come into sudden favor within the past few weeks , and that from the Atlantic to the Pacific all the populations of all the States had knocked off work to play with it , and that the business of the country had now come to a standstill by consequence ; that judges , lawyers , burglars , parsons , thieves , merchants , mechanics , murderers , women , children , babies -- everybody , indeed , could be seen from morning till midnight , absorbed in one deep project and purpose , and only one -- to pen those pigs , work out that puzzle successfully ; that all gayety , all cheerfulness had departed from the nation , and in its place care , preoccupation and anxiety sat upon every countenance , and all faces were drawn , distressed , and furrowed with the signs of age and trouble , and marked with the still sadder signs of mental decay and incipient madness ; that factories were at work night and day in eight cities , and yet to supply the demand for the puzzle was thus far impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 11]: Hawkins was wild with joy , but Sellers was calm .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 8]: Small matters could not disturb his serenity .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 12]: He said -- `` That 's just the way things go .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 34]: A man invents a thing which could revolutionize the arts , produce mountains of money , and bless the earth , and who will bother with it or show any interest in it ?
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 13]: -- and so you are just as poor as you were before .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 39]: But you invent some worthless thing to amuse yourself with , and would throw it away if let alone , and all of a sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 16]: Hunt up that Yankee and collect , Hawkins -- half is yours , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 9]: Leave me to potter at my lecture . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 6]: This was a temperance lecture .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 39]: Sellers was head chief in the Temperance camp , and had lectured , now and then in that interest , but had been dissatisfied with his efforts ; wherefore he was now about to try a new plan .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 78]: After much thought he had concluded that a main reason why his lectures lacked fire or something , was , that they were too transparently amateurish ; that is to say , it was probably too plainly perceptible that the lecturer was trying to tell people about the horrid effects of liquor when he did n't really know anything about those effects except from hearsay , since he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his life .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 15]: His scheme , now , was to prepare himself to speak from bitter experience .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 29]: Hawkins was to stand by with the bottle , calculate the doses , watch the effects , make notes of results , and otherwise assist in the preparation .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 37]: Time was short , for the ladies would be along about noon -- that is to say , the temperance organization called the Daughters of Siloam -- and Sellers must be ready to head the procession .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 33]: The time kept slipping along -- Hawkins did not return -- Sellers could not venture to wait longer ; so he attacked the bottle himself , and proceeded to note the effects .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 23]: Hawkins got back at last ; took one comprehensive glance at the lecturer , and went down and headed off the procession .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 36]: The ladies were grieved to hear that the champion had been taken suddenly ill and violently so , but glad to hear that it was hoped he would be out again in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 25]: As it turned out , the old gentleman did n't turn over or show any signs of life worth speaking of for twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 15]: Then he asked after the procession , and learned what had happened about it .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 14]: He was sorry ; said he had been `` fixed '' for it .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 23]: He remained abed several days , and his wife and daughter took turns in sitting with him and ministering to his wants .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 12]: Often he patted Sally 's head and tried to comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 75]: `` Do n't cry , my child , do n't cry so ; you know your old father did it by mistake and did n't mean a bit of harm ; you know he would n't intentionally do anything to make you ashamed for the world ; you know he was trying to do good and only made the mistake through ignorance , not knowing the right doses and Washington not there to help .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 35]: Do n't cry so , dear , it breaks my old heart to see you , and think I 've brought this humiliation on you and you so dear to me and so good .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 26]: I wo n't ever do it again , indeed I wo n't ; now be comforted , honey , that 's a good child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 65]: But when she was n't on duty at the bedside the crying went on just the same ; then the mother would try to comfort her , and say : `` Do n't cry , dear , he never meant any harm ; it was all one of those happens that you ca n't guard against when you are trying experiments , that way .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: You see I do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 9]: It 's because I know him so well .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 47]: I could never look anybody in the face again if he had got into such an amazing condition as that a-purpose ; but bless you his intention was pure and high , and that makes the act pure , though it was higher than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 23]: We 're not humiliated , dear , he did it under a noble impulse and we do n't need to be ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 11]: There , do n't cry any more , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 21]: Thus , the old gentleman was useful to Sally , during several days , as an explanation of her tearfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 48]: She felt thankful to him for the shelter he was affording her , but often said to herself , `` It 's a shame to let him see in my cryings a reproach -- as if he could ever do anything that could make me reproach him !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 39]: But I ca n't confess ; I 've got to go on using him for a pretext , he 's the only one I 've got in the world , and I do need one so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 46]: As soon as Sellers was out again , and found that stacks of money had been placed in bank for him and Hawkins by the Yankee , he said , `` Now we 'll soon see who 's the Claimant and who 's the Authentic .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 15]: I 'll just go over there and warm up that House of Lords . ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 38]: During the next few days he and his wife were so busy with preparations for the voyage that Sally had all the privacy she needed , and all the chance to cry that was good for her .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 12]: Then the old pair left for New York -- and England .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 11]: Sally had also had a chance to do another thing .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 19]: That was , to make up her mind that life was not worth living upon the present terms .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 45]: If she must give up her impostor and die ; doubtless she must submit ; but might she not lay her whole case before some disinterested person , first , and see if there was n't perhaps some saving way out of the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 12]: She turned this idea over in her mind a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 34]: In her first visit with Hawkins after her parents were gone , the talk fell upon Tracy , and she was impelled to set her case before the statesman and take his counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 14]: So she poured out her heart , and he listened with painful solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 17]: She concluded , pleadingly , with -- `` Do n't tell me he is an impostor .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 18]: I suppose he is , but does n't it look to you as if he is n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 33]: You are cool , you know , and outside ; and so , maybe it can look to you as if he is n't one , when it ca n't to me .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 12]: Does n't it look to you as if he is n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 20]: Could n't you -- ca n't it look to you that way -- for -- for my sake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 19]: The poor man was troubled , but he felt obliged to keep in the neighborhood of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 27]: He fought around the present detail a little while , then gave it up and said he could n't really see his way to clearing Tracy .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 18]: `` No , '' he said , `` the truth is , he 's an impostor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 25]: `` That is , you -- you feel a little certain , but not entirely -- oh , not entirely , Mr. Hawkins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 35]: `` It 's a pity to have to say it -- I do hate to say it , but I do n't think anything about it , I know he 's an impostor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 15]: `` Oh , now , Mr. Hawkins , you ca n't go that far .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 11]: A body ca n't really know it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 15]: It is n't proved that he 's not what he says he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 15]: Should he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched business ?
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 15]: Yes -- at least the most of it -- it ought to be done .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 31]: So he set his teeth and went at the matter with determination , but purposing to spare the girl one pain -- that of knowing that Tracy was a criminal .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 33]: `` Now I am going to tell you a plain tale ; one not pleasant for me to tell or for you to hear , but we 've got to stand it .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 18]: I know all about that fellow ; and I know he is no earl 's son . ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 24]: The girl 's eyes flashed , and she said : `` I do n't care a snap for that -- go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 24]: This was so wholly unexpected that it at once obstructed the narrative ; Hawkins was not even sure that he had heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 13]: He said : `` I do n't know that I quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 27]: Do you mean to say that if he was all right and proper otherwise you 'd be indifferent about the earl part of the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 4]: `` Absolutely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 37]: `` You 'd be entirely satisfied with him and would n't care for his not being an earl 's son , -- that being an earl 's son would n't add any value to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 11]: `` Not the least value that I would care for .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 43]: Why , Mr. Hawkins , I 've gotten over all that day-dreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and all such nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and content with it ; and it is to him I owe my cure .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 18]: And as to anything being able to add a value to him , nothing can do that .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 29]: He is the whole world to me , just as he is ; he comprehends all the values there are -- then how can you add one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 8]: `` She 's pretty far gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 6]: He said that to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 38]: He continued , still to himself , `` I must change my plan again ; I ca n't seem to strike one that will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five minutes on a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 24]: Without making this fellow a criminal , I believe I will invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant her .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 35]: If it fails to do it , then I 'll know that the next rightest thing to do will be to help her to her fate , poor thing , not hinder her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 20]: Then he said aloud : `` Well , Gwendolen -- '' `` I want to be called Sally . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 14]: `` I 'm glad of it ; I like it better , myself .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 14]: Well , then , I 'll tell you about this man Snodgrass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 3]: `` Snodgrass !
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 6]: Is that his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 5]: `` Yes -- Snodgrass .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: The other 's his nom de plume . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: `` It 's hideous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 15]: `` I know it is , but we ca n't help our names . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 15]: `` And that is truly his real name -- and not Howard Tracy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 14]: Hawkins answered , regretfully : `` Yes , it seems a pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 14]: The girl sampled the name musingly , once or twice -- `` Snodgrass .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 2]: Snodgrass .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 8]: No , I could not endure that .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 8]: I could not get used to it .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 11]: No , I should call him by his first name .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 7]: What is his first name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 15]: `` His -- er -- his initials are S. M. '' `` His initials ?
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 9]: I do n't care anything about his initials .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 9]: I ca n't call him by his initials .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: What do they stand for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 48]: `` Well , you see , his father was a physician , and he -- he -- well he was an idolater of his profession , and he -- well , he was a very eccentric man , and -- '' `` What do they stand for !
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 7]: What are you shuffling about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 10]: `` They -- well they stand for Spinal Meningitis .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 16]: His father being a phy -- '' `` I never heard such an infamous name !
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 13]: Nobody can ever call a person that -- a person they love .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 11]: I would n't call an enemy by such a name .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 7]: It sounds like an epithet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 21]: After a moment , she added with a kind of consternation , `` Why , it would be my name !
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 8]: Letters would come with it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 9]: `` Yes -- Mrs. Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 15]: `` Do n't repeat it -- do n't ; I ca n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 7]: Was the father a lunatic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 9]: `` No , that is not charged . ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 12]: `` I am glad of that , because that is transmissible .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 13]: What do you think was the matter with him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 9]: `` Well , I do n't really know .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 28]: The family used to run a good deal to idiots , and so , maybe -- '' `` Oh , there is n't any maybe about it .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: This one was an idiot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 10]: `` Well , yes -- he could have been .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 5]: He was suspected . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 4]: `` Suspected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 6]: said Sally , with irritation .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 23]: `` Would one suspect there was going to be a dark time if he saw the constellations fall out of the sky ?
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 24]: But that is enough about the idiot , I do n't take any interest in idiots ; tell me about the son . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 17]: `` Very well , then , this one was the eldest , but not the favorite .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 17]: His brother , Zylobalsamum -- '' `` Wait -- give me a chance to realize that .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 5]: It is perfectly stupefying .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 9]: Zylo -- what did you call it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 4]: `` Zylobalsamum . ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 14]: `` I never heard such a name : It sounds like a disease .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 6]: Is it a disease ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 12]: `` No , I do n't think it 's a disease .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 16]: It 's either Scriptural or -- '' `` Well , it 's not Scriptural . ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 6]: `` Then it 's anatomical .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 9]: I knew it was one or the other .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 11]: Yes , I remember , now , it is anatomical .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 19]: It 's a ganglion -- a nerve centre -- it is what is called the zylobalsamum process . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 28]: `` Well , go on ; and if you come to any more of them , omit the names ; they make one feel so uncomfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 6]: `` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 63]: As I said , this one was not a favorite in the family , and so he was neglected in every way , never sent to school , always allowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters , and so of course he has grown up a rude , vulgar , ignorant , dissipated ruffian , and -- '' `` He ?
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 6]: It 's no such thing !
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 33]: You ought to be more generous than to make such a statement as that about a poor young stranger who -- who -- why , he is the very opposite of that !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 19]: He is considerate , courteous , obliging , modest , gentle , refined , cultivated-oh , for shame !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 10]: how can you say such things about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 45]: `` I do n't blame you , Sally -- indeed I have n't a word of blame for you for being blinded by -- your affection -- blinded to these minor defects which are so manifest to others who -- '' `` Minor defects ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 7]: Do you call these minor defects ?
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 9]: What are murder and arson , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 22]: `` It is a difficult question to answer straight off -- and of course estimates of such things vary with environment .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 38]: With us , out our way , they would not necessarily attract as much attention as with you , yet they are often regarded with disapproval -- '' `` Murder and arson are regarded with disapproval ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 6]: `` Oh , frequently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 4]: `` With disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 9]: Who are those Puritans you are talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 15]: But wait -- how did you come to know so much about this family ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 10]: Where did you get all this hearsay evidence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 9]: `` Sally , it is n't hearsay evidence .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 8]: That is the serious part of it .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 8]: I knew that family -- personally . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 5]: This was a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 3]: `` You ?
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 6]: You actually knew them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 19]: `` Knew Zylo , as we used to call him , and knew his father , Dr. Snodgrass .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 28]: I did n't know your own Snodgrass , but have had glimpses of him from time to time , and I heard about him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 31]: He was the common talk , you see , on account of his -- '' `` On account of his not being a house-burner or an assassin , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 7]: That would have made him commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 8]: Where did you know these people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 6]: `` In Cherokee Strip . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 6]: `` Oh , how preposterous !
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 18]: There are not enough people in Cherokee Strip to give anybody a reputation , good or bad .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 6]: There is n't a quorum .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 16]: Why the whole population consists of a couple of wagon loads of horse thieves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 15]: Hawkins answered placidly -- `` Our friend was one of those wagon loads . ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 34]: Sally 's eyes burned and her breath came quick and fast , but she kept a fairly good grip on her anger and did not let it get the advantage of her tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 9]: The statesman sat still and waited for developments .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 7]: He was content with his work .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 30]: It was as handsome a piece of diplomatic art as he had ever turned out , he thought ; and now , let the girl make her own choice .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 41]: He judged she would let her spectre go ; he had n't a doubt of it in fact ; but anyway , let the choice be made , and he was ready to ratify it and offer no further hindrance .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 13]: Meantime Sally had thought her case out and made up her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 11]: To the major 's disappointment the verdict was against him .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 19]: Sally said : `` He has no friend but me , and I will not desert him now .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 32]: I will not marry him if his moral character is bad ; but if he can prove that it is n't , I will -- and he shall have the chance .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 33]: To me he seems utterly good and dear ; I 've never seen anything about him that looked otherwise -- except , of course , his calling himself an earl 's son .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 20]: Maybe that is only vanity , and no real harm , when you get to the bottom of it .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 15]: I do not believe he is any such person as you have painted him .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 6]: I want to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 12]: I want you to find him and send him to me .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 23]: I will implore him to be honest with me , and tell me the whole truth , and not be afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 14]: `` Very well ; if that is your decision I will do it .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 24]: But Sally , you know , he 's poor , and -- '' `` Oh , I do n't care anything about that .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 7]: That 's neither here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 8]: Will you bring him to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 6]: `` I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 2]: When ?
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 27]: -- '' `` Oh , dear , it 's getting toward dark , now , and so you 'll have to put it off till morning .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 13]: But you will find him in the morning , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 3]: Promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 10]: `` I 'll have him here by daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 18]: `` Oh , now you 're your own old self again -- and lovelier than ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 9]: `` I could n't ask fairer than that .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 5]: Good-bye , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 21]: Sally mused a moment alone , then said earnestly , `` I love him in spite of his name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 10]: and went about her affairs with a light heart .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 12]: Hawkins went straight to the telegraph office and disburdened his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 21]: He said to himself , `` She 's not going to give this galvanized cadaver up , that 's plain .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 10]: Wild horses ca n't pull her away from him .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 18]: I 've done my share ; it 's for Sellers to take an innings , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 13]: So he sent this message to New York : `` Come back .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 4]: Hire special train .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 9]: She 's going to marry the materializee . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 32]: Meantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say that the Earl of Rossmore had just arrived from England , and would do himself the pleasure of calling in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 34]: Sally said to herself , `` It is a pity he did n't stop in New York ; but it 's no matter ; he can go up to-morrow and see my father .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 18]: He has come over here to tomahawk papa , very likely -- or buy out his claim .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 26]: This thing would have excited me , a while back ; but it has only one interest for me now , and only one value .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 23]: I can say to -- to -- Spine , Spiny , Spinal -- I do n't like any form of that name !
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 44]: -- I can say to him to-morrow , ` Do n't try to keep it up any more , or I shall have to tell you whom I have been talking with last night , and then you will be embarrassed . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 19]: Tracy could n't know he was to be invited for the morrow , or he might have waited .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 25]: As it was , he was too miserable to wait any longer ; for his last hope -- a letter -- had failed him .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 11]: It was fully due to-day ; it had not come .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 8]: Had his father really flung him away ?
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 4]: It looked so .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 13]: It was not like his father , but it surely looked so .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 30]: His father was a rather tough nut , in truth , but had never been so with his son -- still , this implacable silence had a calamitous look .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 13]: Anyway , Tracy would go to the Towers and -- then what ?
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 33]: He did n't know ; his head was tired out with thinking -- he would n't think about what he must do or say -- let it all take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 22]: So that he saw Sally once more , he would be satisfied , happen what might ; he would n't care .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 13]: He hardly knew how he got to the Towers , or when .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 15]: He knew and cared for only one thing -- he was alone with Sally .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 37]: She was kind , she was gentle , there was moisture in her eyes , and a yearning something in her face and manner which she could not wholly hide -- but she kept her distance .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 3]: They talked .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 30]: Bye and bye she said -- watching his downcast countenance out of the corner of her eye -- `` It 's so lonesome -- with papa and mamma gone .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 17]: I try to read , but I ca n't seem to get interested in any book .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 14]: I try the newspapers , but they do put such rubbish in them .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 48]: You take up a paper and start to read something you thinks interesting , and it goes on and on and on about how somebody -- well , Dr. Snodgrass , for instance -- '' Not a movement from Tracy , not the quiver of a muscle .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 12]: Sally was amazed -- what command of himself he must have !
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 20]: Being disconcerted , she paused so long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said : `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 10]: `` Oh , I thought you were not listening .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 45]: Yes , it goes on and on about this Doctor Snodgrass , till you are so tired , and then about his younger son -- the favorite son -- Zylobalsamum Snodgrass -- '' Not a sign from Tracy , whose head was drooping again .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 4]: What supernatural self-possession !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 46]: Sally fixed her eye on him and began again , resolved to blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply the dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words when those words are properly loaded with unexpected meanings .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 74]: `` And next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son -- not the favorite , this one -- and how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood , and allowed to grow up unschooled , ignorant , coarse , vulgar , the comrade of the community 's scum , and become in his completed manhood a rude , profane , dissipated ruffian -- '' That head still drooped !
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 46]: Sally rose , moved softly and solemnly a step or two , and stood before Tracy -- his head came slowly up , his meek eyes met her intense ones -- then she finished with deep impressiveness -- '' -- named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 8]: Tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 23]: The girl was outraged by this iron indifference and callousness , and cried out -- `` What are you made of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 7]: `` Have n't you any sensitiveness ?
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 15]: Do n't these things touch any poor remnant of delicate feeling in you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 17]: `` N -- no , '' he said wonderingly , `` they do n't seem to .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 5]: Why should they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 39]: `` O , dear me , how can you look so innocent , and foolish , and good , and empty , and gentle , and all that , right in the hearing of such things as those !
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 11]: Look me in the eye -- straight in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 11]: There , now then , answer me without a flinch .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 97]: Is n't Doctor Snodgrass your father , and is n't Zylobalsamum your brother , '' -LSB- here Hawkins was about to enter the room , but changed his mind upon hearing these words , and elected for a walk down town , and so glided swiftly away -RSB- , `` and is n't your name Spinal Meningitis , and is n't your father a doctor and an idiot , like all the family for generations , and does n't he name all his children after poisons and pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the human body ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 11]: Answer me , some way or somehow -- and quick .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 26]: Why do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me going mad before your face with suspense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 42]: `` Oh , I wish I could do -- do -- I wish I could do something , anything that would give you peace again and make you happy ; but I know of nothing -- I know of no way .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 11]: I have never heard of these awful people before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 5]: Say it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 13]: `` I have never -- never in my life till now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 13]: `` Oh , you do look so honest when you say that !
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 29]: It must be true -- surely you could n't look that way , you would n't look that way if it were not true -- would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 8]: `` I could n't and would n't .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 4]: It is true .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 25]: Oh , let us end this suffering -- take me back into your heart and confidence -- '' `` Wait -- one more thing .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 49]: Tell me you told that falsehood out of mere vanity and are sorry for it ; that you 're not expecting to ever wear the coronet of an earl -- '' `` Truly I am cured -- cured this very day -- I am not expecting it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 8]: `` O , now you are mine !
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 32]: I 've got you back in the beauty and glory of your unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity , and nobody shall ever take you from me again but the grave !
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 15]: And if -- '' `` De earl of Rossmore , fum Englan ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 5]: `` My father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 11]: The young man released the girl and hung his head .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 28]: The old gentleman stood surveying the couple -- the one with a strongly complimentary right eye , the other with a mixed expression done with the left .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 10]: This is difficult , and not often resorted to .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 31]: Presently his face relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness , and he said to his son : `` Do n't you think you could embrace me , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 8]: The young man did it with alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 19]: `` Then you are the son of an earl , after all , '' said Sally , reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 15]: `` Yes , I -- '' `` Then I wo n't have you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 15]: `` O , but you know -- '' `` No , I will not .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 8]: You 've told me another fib . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 5]: `` She 's right .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 6]: Go away and leave us .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 8]: I want to talk with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 6]: Berkeley was obliged to go .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 7]: But he did not go far .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 6]: He remained on the premises .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 81]: At midnight the conference between the old gentleman and the young girl was still going blithely on , but it presently drew to a close , and the former said : `` I came all the way over here to inspect you , my dear , with the general idea of breaking off this match if there were two fools of you , but as there 's only one , you can have him if you 'll take him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 7]: `` Indeed I will , then !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 6]: May I kiss you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 4]: `` You may .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 12]: Now you shall have that privilege whenever you are good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 13]: Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the laboratory .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 14]: He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention , Snodgrass , there .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 12]: The news was told him that the English Rossmore was come .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 18]: -- `` And I 'm his son , Viscount Berkeley , not Howard Tracy any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 4]: Hawkins was aghast .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 13]: He said : `` Good gracious , then you 're dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 4]: `` Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 12]: `` Yes you are -- we 've got your ashes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 20]: `` Hang those ashes , I 'm tired of them ; I 'll give them to my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 38]: Slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head that this was really a flesh and blood young man , and not the insubstantial resurrection he and Sellers had so long supposed him to be .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 22]: Then he said with feeling -- `` I 'm so glad ; so glad on Sally 's account , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: We took you for a departed materialized bank thief from Tahlequah .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 10]: This will be a heavy blow to Sellers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 29]: Then he explained the whole matter to Berkeley , who said : `` Well , the Claimant must manage to stand the blow , severe as it is .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 9]: But he 'll get over the disappointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 6]: `` Who -- the colonel ?
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 17]: He 'll get over it the minute he invents a new miracle to take its place .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 10]: And he 's already at it by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 21]: But look here -- what do you suppose became of the man you 've been representing all this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 12]: I saved his clothes -- it was all I could do .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 9]: I am afraid he lost his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 24]: `` Well , you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those clothes , in money or certificates of deposit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 12]: `` No , I found only five hundred and a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 11]: I borrowed the trifle and banked the five hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 9]: `` What 'll we do about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 8]: `` Return it to the owner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 12]: `` It 's easy said , but not easy to manage .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 12]: Let 's leave it alone till we get Sellers 's advice .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 5]: And that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 35]: I 've got to run and meet Sellers and explain who you are not and who you are , or he 'll come thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 15]: But -- suppose your father came over here to break off the match ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 13]: `` Well , is n't he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally ?
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 6]: That 's all safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 10]: So Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the Sellerses .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 13]: Rossmore Towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding week .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 14]: The two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized at once .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 100]: Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most extraordinary character he had ever met -- a man just made out of the condensed milk of human kindness , yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any but the most practised character-reader ; a man whose whole being was sweetness , patience and charity , yet with a cunning so profound , an ability so marvelous in the acting of a double part , that many a person of considerable intelligence might live with him for centuries and never suspect the presence in him of these characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 47]: Finally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers , instead of a big one at the British embassy , with the militia and the fire brigades and the temperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession , as at first proposed by one of the earls .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 35]: The art-firm and Barrow were present at the wedding , and the tinner and Puss had been invited , but the tinner was ill and Puss was nursing him -- for they were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 33]: The Sellerses were to go to England with their new allies for a brief visit , but when it was time to take the train from Washington , the colonel was missing .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 23]: Hawkins was going as far as New York with the party , and said he would explain the matter on the road .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 15]: The explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in Hawkins 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 54]: In it he promised to join Mrs. Sellers later , in England , and then went on to say : The truth is , my dear Hawkins , a mighty idea has been born to me within the hour , and I must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear ones .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 34]: A man 's highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones , and must be attended to with his best promptness and energy , at whatsoever cost to his affections or his convenience .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 22]: And first of all a man 's duties is his duty to his own honor -- he must keep that spotless .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 4]: Mine is threatened .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 35]: When I was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity , I forwarded to the Czar of Russia -- perhaps prematurely -- an offer for the purchase of Siberia , naming a vast sum .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 37]: Since then an episode has warned me that the method by which I was expecting to acquire this money -- materialization upon a scale of limitless magnitude -- is marred by a taint of temporary uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: His imperial majesty may accept my offer at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 18]: If this should occur now , I should find myself painfully embarrassed , in fact financially inadequate .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 6]: I could not take Siberia .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 11]: This would become known , and my credit would suffer .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 46]: Recently my private hours have been dark indeed , but the sun shines main , now ; I see my way ; I shall be able to meet my obligation , and without having to ask an extension of the stipulated time , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 23]: This grand new idea of mine -- the sublimest I have ever conceived , will save me whole , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 22]: I am leaving for San Francisco this moment , to test it , by the help of the great Lick telescope .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 29]: Like all of my more notable discoveries and inventions , it is based upon hard , practical scientific laws ; all other bases are unsound and hence untrustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 27]: In brief , then , I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the climates of the earth according to the desire of the populations interested .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 73]: That is to say , I will furnish climates to order , for cash or negotiable paper , taking the old climates in part payment , of course , at a fair discount , where they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and let out for hire to poor and remote communities not able to afford a good climate and not caring for an expensive one for mere display .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 27]: My studies have convinced me that the regulation of climates and the breeding of new varieties at will from the old stock is a feasible thing .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 22]: Indeed I am convinced that it has been done before ; done in prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded civilizations .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 14]: Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial manipulation of climates in bygone times .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 5]: Take the glacial period .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: Was that produced by accident ?
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 10]: Not at all ; it was done for money .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 15]: I have a thousand proofs of it , and will some day reveal them .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 11]: I will confide to you an outline of my idea .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 36]: It is to utilize the spots on the sun -- get control of them , you understand , and apply the stupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the reorganizing of our climates .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 40]: At present they merely make trouble and do harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms ; but once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they will become a boon to man .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 53]: I have my plan all mapped out , whereby I hope and expect to acquire complete and perfect control of the sun-spots , also details of the method whereby I shall employ the same commercially ; but I will not venture to go into particulars before the patents shall have been issued .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 47]: I shall hope and expect to sell shop-rights to the minor countries at a reasonable figure and supply a good business article of climate to the great empires at special rates , together with fancy brands for coronations , battles and other great and particular occasions .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 33]: There are billions of money in this enterprise , no expensive plant is required , and I shall begin to realize in a few days -- in a few weeks at furthest .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 24]: I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia the moment it is delivered , and thus save my honor and my credit .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 6]: I am confident of this .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 27]: I would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as I telegraph you , be it night or be it day .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 41]: I wish you to take up all the country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many degrees south , and buy Greenland and Iceland at the best figure you can get now while they are cheap .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 21]: It is my intention to move one of the tropics up there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 46]: I will have the entire Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next year , and will use the surplusage of the old climate , over and above what can be utilized on the equator , to reduce the temperature of opposition resorts .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 27]: But I have said enough to give you an idea of the prodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible and enormously profitable character of it .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 30]: I shall join all you happy people in England as soon as I shall have sold out some of my principal climates and arranged with the Czar about Siberia .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 9]: Meantime , watch for a sign from me .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 33]: Eight days from now , we shall be wide asunder ; for I shall be on the border of the Pacific , and you far out on the Atlantic , approaching England .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 77]: That day , if I am alive and my sublime discovery is proved and established , I will send you greeting , and my messenger shall deliver it where you are , in the solitudes of the sea ; for I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like drifting smoke , and you will know it for my love-sign , and will say `` Mulberry Sellers throws us a kiss across the universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 2]: APPENDIX .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 7]: WEATHER FOR USE IN THIS BOOK .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 6]: Selected from the Best Authorities .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 109]: A brief though violent thunderstorm which had raged over the city was passing away ; but still , though the rain had ceased more than an hour before , wild piles of dark and coppery clouds , in which a fierce and rayless glow was laboring , gigantically overhung the grotesque and huddled vista of dwarf houses , while in the distance , sheeting high over the low , misty confusion of gables and chimneys , spread a pall of dead , leprous blue , suffused with blotches of dull , glistening yellow , and with black plague-spots of vapor floating and faint lightnings crinkling on its surface .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 75]: Thunder , still muttering in the close and sultry air , kept the scared dwellers in the street within , behind their closed shutters ; and all deserted , cowed , dejected , squalid , like poor , stupid , top-heavy things that had felt the wrath of the summer tempest , stood the drenched structures on either side of the narrow and crooked way , ghastly and picturesque , under the giant canopy .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 42]: Rain dripped wretchedly in slow drops of melancholy sound from their projecting eaves upon the broken flagging , lay there in pools or trickled into the swollen drains , where the fallen torrent sullenly gurgled on its way to the river .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 6]: `` The Brazen Android . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 5]: - W. D. O'Connor .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 25]: The fiery mid-March sun a moment hung Above the bleak Judean wilderness ; Then darkness swept upon us , and ' t was night .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 6]: `` Easter-Eve at Kerak-Moab . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 4]: -- Clinton Scollard .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 9]: The quick-coming winter twilight was already at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 14]: Snow was again falling , sifting delicately down , incidentally as it were .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 4]: `` Felicia . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 5]: Fanny N. D. Murfree .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 3]: Merciful heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 35]: The whole west , from right to left , blazes up with a fierce light , and next instant the earth reels and quivers with the awful shock of ten thousand batteries of artillery .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 32]: It is the signal for the Fury to spring -- for a thousand demons to scream and shriek -- for innumerable serpents of fire to writhe and light up the blackness .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 44]: Now the rain falls -- now the wind is let loose with a terrible shriek -- now the lightning is so constant that the eyes burn , and the thunder-claps merge into an awful roar , as did the 800 cannon at Gettysburg .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 2]: Crash !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 2]: Crash !
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 2]: Crash !
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: It is the cottonwood trees falling to earth .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 2]: Shriek !
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 2]: Shriek !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 2]: Shriek !
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 16]: It is the Demon racing along the plain and uprooting even the blades of grass .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 2]: Shock !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 2]: Shock !
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 2]: Shock !
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 15]: It is the Fury flinging his fiery bolts into the bosom of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 9]: -- `` The Demon and the Fury . ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 3]: M. Quad .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 26]: Away up the gorge all diurnal fancies trooped into the wide liberties of endless luminous vistas of azure sunlit mountains beneath the shining azure heavens .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 24]: The sky , looking down in deep blue placidities , only here and there smote the water to azure emulations of its tint .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 9]: -- `` In the Stranger 's Country . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 4]: Charles Egbert Craddock .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 15]: There was every indication of a dust-storm , though the sun still shone brilliantly .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 9]: The hot wind had become wild and rampant .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 14]: It was whipping up the sandy coating of the plain in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 21]: High in the air were seen whirling spires and cones of sand -- a curious effect against the deep-blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 25]: Below , puffs of sand were breaking out of the plain in every direction , as though the plain were alive with invisible horsemen .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 37]: These sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind ; it was the larger clouds that were lifted whole into the air , and the larger clouds of sand were becoming more and more the rule .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 23]: Alfred 's eye , quickly scanning the horizon , descried the roof of the boundary-rider 's hut still gleaming in the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 6]: He remembered the hut well .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 22]: It could not be farther than four miles , if as much as that , from this point of the track .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 30]: He also knew these dust-storms of old ; Bindarra was notorious for them : Without thinking twice , Alfred put spurs to his horse and headed for the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 70]: Before he had ridden half the distance the detached clouds of sand banded together in one dense whirlwind , and it was only owing to his horse 's instinct that he did not ride wide of the hut altogether ; for during the last half-mile he never saw the hut , until its outline loomed suddenly over his horse 's ears ; and by then the sun was invisible .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 9]: -- `` A Bride from the Bush . ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 8]: It rained forty days and forty nights .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 3]: -- Genesis .
