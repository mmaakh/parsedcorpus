Parsing [sent. 1 len. 22]: The Fortunes of the Farrells By Mrs George de Horne Vaizey Old Mr Bernard Farrell is known to be immensely rich .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 11]: No one in his family has seen him for ages .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 22]: Suddenly he turns up , and is invited to stay for a few days , as he is n't very well .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 46]: His proposition is , that he would like various of his nephews and nieces to come and stay with him for quite a long time , so that he might gauge which of them should receive the greater part of his wealth after he dies .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 24]: The house-part duly convenes , and they do n't find him a very agreeable host , but for the most part they persevere .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 13]: He has made a preliminary will `` in case of accident '' .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 25]: He is trying to keep this will secret , and of course the young people are all agog to know what is in it .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 25]: One day he accidentally leaves his desk open , and realises that someone has been at his desk , and has read the will .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 18]: He calls all the young people to his bed , and asks them point-blank who it was .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 19]: Of course he gets various kinds of answer , from the offended , to the frightened and cowed .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 18]: But by chance he finds out exactly who had peeked into his desk and read the will .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 32]: We wo n't spoil the story for you , but would say this : that it is as good a Horne Vaizey story as any , even the earlier Pixie books .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 15]: NH THE FORTUNES OF THE FARRELLS BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 5]: FROM PRETENCE TO REALITY .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 14]: `` Berengaria , what do you generally do with your old court trains ?
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 8]: How do you use them up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 48]: The fire had died down to a dull red glow ; only one tiny flame remained , which , flickering to and fro , showed a wide expanse of floor , and two easy-chairs drawn up before the fender , on which reclined vague , feminine figures .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 48]: The voice which had asked the question was slow and languid , and breathed a wearied indifference to the world in general , which was more than equalled in the tone of the reply -- `` Really , do n't you know , I ca n't say !
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 33]: I put them away , meaning to use them for cloaks or evening-dresses ; but I forget , or they get mislaid , or the maid confiscates them for her own purposes .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 18]: I expect , as a matter of fact , she makes them up into Sunday blouses . ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 8]: `` You spoil that woman , dear !
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 13]: You are so absurdly easy-going that she robs you right and left .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 13]: Do take my advice , and give her notice at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 12]: `` I could n't , darling , even to please you !
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 20]: It bores me so to deal with strangers , and no one else could do my hair like Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 26]: If it pleases her to use up a few of my garments , why should n't the poor soul have her pleasure like the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 16]: That reminds me , Lucille -- are you going to the duchess 's ball to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 18]: I suppose it is superfluous to ask , since no entertainment is complete without you nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 7]: `` Oh , I suppose so !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 12]: If I am not too fagged , that is to say .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 26]: But I have a dinner first , and two At-homes , and people make such a fuss if you do n't put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 56]: One hardly feels up to dancing after struggling through two of the asphyxiating mobs dignified by the name of entertainments ; still , I promised Arthur the cotillion , and he will be desolated if I play him false ; and I have a new frock for the occasion which is really rather a dream .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 12]: Silver tissue over satin , and shoulder - straps of diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 7]: I had them reset on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 20]: I spend quite a fortune on resetting jewels nowadays ; but one must be original , or die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 10]: `` My dear , you will be too bewitching !
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 9]: Lord Arthur will be more desperate than ever .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 10]: My poor little self will be nowhere beside you !
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 13]: I 'm going to be sweet and simple in chiffon and pearls .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 5]: Paquin made the gown .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 7]: Do n't ask what it cost !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 12]: I tore up the bill and threw it in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 13]: Really , do n't you know , it made me quite depressed !
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 5]: So perishable , too !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 13]: I expect I shall be in rags before the evening is over .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 15]: But it 's quite sweet at present -- all frilly-willys from top to toe .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 16]: I do love to be fluffy and feminine , and my pearls really are unique !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: The princess examined them quite carefully when I met her last winter , and said she had rarely seen finer specimens .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 12]: I would n't wear them at all unless they were good .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 8]: I can not endure inferior jewels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 48]: The speaker lolled still more luxuriously in her chair , then started forward , as the door opened with a bang , and a harsh voice accosted her by name -- `` Miss Mollie , your mother wants to know if you have finished darning the socks ?
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 18]: She is putting away the clean clothes , and wants to sort them with the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 29]: The Lady Lucille -- otherwise Mollie Farrell , the penniless daughter of an impoverished house -- jumped up from her chair , and clasped her hands in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 30]: In blissful contemplation of imagining chiffons and cotillions , the prosaic duties of reality had slipped from her mind , and recollection brought with it a pang of remorse .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 4]: `` Misery me !
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 10]: I forgot the very existence of the wretched things !
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 26]: Tell mother , Annie , that I 'll set to work this minute , and put them away myself as soon as they are done .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 19]: Tell her I 'm sorry ; tell her I 'll be as quick as I possibly can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 45]: Annie stood for a moment in eloquent silence then shut the door and descended the stairs ; while Mollie groped her way across the room , and Berengaria lifted herself from her chair with a sigh , and slipped her hand along the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 7]: `` I 'll light the gas .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 15]: How horrid it is , being dragged back to earth by these sordid interruptions !
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 33]: It 's always the way -- as soon as I begin to forget myself , and enjoy a taste of luxury , back I 'm dragged to the same dull old life .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 25]: I really saw that silver tissue , and felt the coldness of the diamonds against my shoulder ; and then -- _ socks _ !
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 20]: Those wretched , thick , ugly socks , with the heels all out , and the toes in rags !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 22]: I think schoolboys ought to be obliged to darn their own clothes , just to teach them a little care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 15]: `` Well , be aisy ; you have n't to darn them , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 17]: It 's my work , which is the best of reasons why it is left undone .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 10]: Hurry with the gas , there 's a dear .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 17]: There 's no time for conundrums , if I am to finish to - night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 50]: Another sigh , the striking of a match , and the light sprang up , and showed a tall , girlish figure , clad in a blue serge skirt , and a flannel blouse , faded from repeated washing , and showing signs of a decided shortage of material .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 54]: Considered as a costume , it was a painful contrast to the silver and diamonds of the fair Berengaria ; but the shabby garments looked their best on Ruth Farrell 's slight form , and the face reflected in the strip of mirror above the mantelpiece had a distinct charm of its own .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 53]: A low brow below masses of brown hair ; a flush of carmine on the cheeks ; soft lips , drooping pathetically at the corners ; and -- most striking feature of all -- thickly marked eyebrows of almost jetty black , stretching in long , straight lines above the grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 24]: A pretty , almost a beautiful face , full of character , full of thought , full of a restless , unsatisfied yearning .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 29]: She threw the burnt-out match on to the fire , and turned to survey the room -- surely the most motley and curious apartment that could be imagined !
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 40]: The sloping roof proved at a glance the position under the leads , and a peep at the outside of the door would have shown the word `` Attica '' painted in bold white letters on the top panel .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 82]: Attica -- or the land of attic -- constituted the boudoirs of the Ladies Berengaria and Lucille , the work-rooms and play-rooms , dens and havens of refuge , of Ruth and Mollie Farrell , and their young stepsisters , Trix and Betty Connor ; for it was of generous proportions , measuring a square eight yards or more , and the floor was divided into four equal sections by lines of white paint against the brown of the original staining .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 31]: Each sister held an exclusive right to her own domain , and for another to enter therein without special invitation was held as an outrage against decency and good taste .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 39]: In the beginning of things , Ruth , as the eldest , had claimed the right of first choice , and , being a young woman who liked her comforts , had instantly and unhesitatingly appropriated the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 69]: Mollie , coming next in order , plumped for the window , it being her sunny habit to look forward to an endless summer ; Trix , grumbling vigorously , appropriated the angle made by the blank walls nearest the fire ; and poor Betty made her lair in the direct draught of the doorway , and enjoyed a permanent cold in the head from November to March .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 21]: A glance at the four corners of the room afforded a very fair idea of the characters of its inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 34]: Ruth 's `` Fireland '' domain had an air of luxury of its own , though the draperies were of simple turkey-red , and the pictures mounted on home-made frames of brown paper .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 56]: There was a row of shelves against the wall , holding quite a goodly show of volumes , ranged neatly side by side , while a curtained recess at one end contained tea-cups and canister , and a small metal kettle , as scrupulously bright as on the day when it had left the shop .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 14]: An old folding-chair had been painted green , and supplied with frilled cushions .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 62]: There was a sensible little table , holding a hand-machine , and a work-basket -- yawning apart , it is true , but neatly strapped to prevent accident ; and on the mantelpiece a crowd of photographs , and a few oddments of blue china , all carefully dusted by the owner 's hand , and set out with artistic effect .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 137]: Last , and crowning luxury of all , a screen stood behind the low chair , manufactured out of a clothes-horse flounced with turkey-red , which was at once the comfort and distraction of Ruth 's soul ; for while , from her point of view , it was an indispensable comfort , shutting out draughts from window and door , and giving to her little nook the last blessing of privacy , Trix denounced the innovation as the incarnation of selfishness , Betty 's teeth chattered with a noise like castanets , and Mollie peered round the corner with her shoulders huddled in a shawl , and her face at once so cheerful , so unreproving , and so bleached with cold , that it was not in human nature to refuse the desired invitation .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 48]: Mollie 's domain of `` Bellevue '' comprised the square-shaped window , on the sill of which she cultivated nasturtiums and mignonette in summer , and in the embrasure stood a window-seat covered with blue cloth , that was really the remains of an old winter skirt .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 65]: Visitors to `` Bellevue '' always paused to admire the sprays of flowers which were embroidered here and there on this blue background ; and then Mollie `` dissembled , '' as she called it , smiling sweet recognition of the praise , but never once breathing the secret that the whole being and intent of these flowers was to hide the joins beneath .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 43]: She also possessed a table and a work-basket ; but the former was decidedly ancient and insecure as to legs , while the basket made no pretence of shutting , but looked on unabashed while its contents lay scattered over the rug .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 38]: A dressmaker 's stand stood in the corner , on which a blouse , more or less complete , was invariably pinned , waiting for the moment when Mollie had time to devote to her favourite occupation .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 45]: There were no book - shelves , but a litter of magazines behind a cushion on the window-seat , and innumerable photographs were secured to the wall by black-headed pins , to fade slowly but surely into unrecognition in the unbroken glare of light .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 44]: Mollie herself pined for curtains to mitigate the draught during the winter months , but the three other inmates of Attica loudly declared that they could not spare a fraction of light , so she gave way smiling , as her custom was .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 20]: Mollie never grumbled ; it was so dull , as she said , and she loved to be gay .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 41]: An invincible cheeriness of heart carried her gallantly over the quicksands in which Ruth was submerged by reason of her moodiness , and Trix by her quick temper , and made it a physical impossibility to repine over the inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 18]: Fifteen-year-old Trix was in that stage when the Oxford examination seems the end-all and be-all of existence .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 31]: Her section of Attica was proudly dubbed `` The Study , '' and had its walls covered with maps , class lists , and `` memos '' of great variety .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 36]: The desk was strewn with papers and exercise-books , and there lingered in the air that indescribable scent of sponge , slate , indiarubber , and freshly sharpened pencils which seem inseparable from youthful study .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 10]: Trix confessed to one weakness , -- only one !
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 27]: -- an overwhelming greed for pencil-boxes and sharpeners , and the contents of the wooden shelf above the desk testified to her indulgence in this craving .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 9]: `` The girls gave them to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 49]: she used to say when strangers exclaimed at the number of the piled-up boxes , but she blushed even as she spoke , knowing well that to keep sixpence in her pocket and pass a pencil-box of a new design , was a feat of self-denial beyond imagination .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 37]: Dear , chubby , placid Betty was only thirteen , and cared for nothing in the world but her relations , chocolate-creams , and scrambling through the day 's classes with as little exertion as possible .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 48]: She shivered in her corner , poor mite , sucking audibly , to the distraction of her elders , the while she skimmed over her lessons , and looked forward to the time when she would be free to devote herself to the hobby of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 20]: Sometimes it was postcards ; sometimes it was stamps ; sometimes it was penny toys collected from street vendors .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 27]: It had once soared as high as autographs , and a promising beginning of three signatures were already pasted into the remaining leaves of an exercise-book .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 43]: Whatever the collection might be , it lived in heaps on the uncarpeted floor ; and when Betty had a tidy fit , was covered with a crochet antimacassar which had known better days , and had grown decidedly mellow in tint .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 37]: On this particular afternoon , the two younger sisters were taking tea with school friends , while their elders enjoyed an uninterrupted _ tete - a-tete _ , when they could indulge in a favourite game .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 42]: When life was unusually flat and prosaic , when the weather was wet , invitations conspicuous by their absence , and the want of pocket-money particularly poignant , Mollie would cry ardently : `` Let 's be Berengaria and Lucille ! ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 4]: and , presto !
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 40]: the two girls were transplanted to another world -- a world with the magic letter W added to its address , where empty purses and dyed dresses existed not , and all was joy , jewellery , and junketing .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 40]: Lucille had lately become the bride of a millionaire and adoring duke ; the peerless Berengaria wrought havoc with the peace of Lord Arthur , and had more suitors than she could count on the fingers of both hands .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 31]: It was a fascinating make-believe ; but , as Ruth plaintively remarked , it did come with somewhat of a shock to be dragged back to earth by -- socks !
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 47]: She stood leaning against the mantelpiece , looking on with frowning brows while her sister collected together scattered materials , and carried them and the yawning basket back to the cosy corner in Fireland , where , for the hour , she was an invited guest .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: `` Quick 's the word and sharp 's the action ! ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 4]: cried Mollie cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 42]: `` Now for a grand old cobble ; and if there are any heels out to-day , my fine young gentlemen , do n't blame _ me _ if you have to tread on knots for the rest of the week !
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 37]: It 's the strangest thing on earth that I can remember nice things year after year without an effort , and yet forget this horrid mending every Saturday as regularly as the day comes round . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 4]: `` Carelessness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 12]: replied Ruth shortly , and with the candour of near relations .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 9]: `` I could n't forget if I tried .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 36]: First thing when I wake in the morning I think of all the bothersome duties I have to do in the day , and the last thing at night I am thinking of them still .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 9]: But you are so frivolous , Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 10]: `` And you are so morbid , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 34]: You do n't offer to help me , I observe ; and since you are so conscientious as all that , I should think you might lend me a hand in my extremity .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 23]: I 'll give you Ransome 's for a treat ; he breaks out at the toes , but his heels are intact .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 13]: It 's playwork mending for him compared with the other boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 62]: She tossed a collection of brown woollen stockings into her sister 's lap , and Ruth took them up , frowning heavily with her black brows , but never dreaming of refusing the request , though her own share of the household mending had kept her employed during the earlier part of the afternoon , while Mollie was amusing herself elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 47]: She took a darning-egg out of her basket , threaded a needle daintily , and set to work in the painstaking manner which characterised all her efforts ; but she sighed as she worked , and Mollie sang , and that was the difference between them .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 16]: `` Do n't make such a noise , Mollie ; you make my head ache .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 26]: Another time , I wish you would do your mending when I do mine , and then we should get a chance of a rest .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 11]: Just to-day , too , when the girls are out !
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 15]: I hate a large family , where there is never any privacy or repose .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 14]: I wish the pater could afford to send the boys to a boarding-school .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 16]: It would be the making of them , and such a blessing to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: Mollie pursed her lips disapprovingly .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 7]: `` I 'd miss them horribly .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 48]: They are naughty , of course , and noisy and tiresome , and make no end of work , but that 's the nature of boys ; on the other hand , they are full of fun and good-humour , if you take them the right way .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 15]: And they are affectionate little ruffians , too ; and so good - looking .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 14]: I 'm proud of them on Sundays , in their Eton suits . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 17]: `` But there 's only one Sunday , and six long days of shabbiness and patches !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 26]: Bruce ought to have a new school suit ; the one he is wearing has descended from the other two , and is disgracefully shabby .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 34]: I spoke to mother about it to-day , and she said she had intended to buy one this month , but business was bad , and there was the coal bill to pay .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 4]: The old story !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 17]: Business always _ is _ bad , and the coal bill is ever with us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 16]: Mollie crinkled her brows , and for a fraction of a second her face clouded .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 10]: `` There 's no hope for me , then !
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 58]: I was going to plead for an extra sovereign to carry me to the end of the quarter , for I 've spent my last cent , and there are one or two absolute necessities which I shall have to get by hook or by crook , or stay in bed until the next allowance is due .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 10]: Well ; something will turn up , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 25]: It 's always the darkest the hour before the dawn , and , financially speaking , it 's pitch black at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 21]: Let 's pretend Uncle Bernard suddenly appeared upon the scene , and presented us each with a handsome cheque . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 8]: `` I 'm tired of Uncle Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 69]: Ever since I was a child I have heard about him and his eccentricities , and his house , and his wealth , and that we were his nearest relatives , and that some day he would surely remember us , and break his silence ; but he never has , so now I look upon him as a sort of mythological figure who has no real existence .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 13]: If he cared anything about us he would have written long ago .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 18]: I expect he has forgotten our very existence , and left all his money to charities . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 13]: `` I expect he has , but it 's fun to pretend .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 12]: Suppose he remembered my birthday and sent me a ten-pound note !
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 17]: Fancy me , my dear , with a whole ten pounds to spend as I liked .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 6]: What fun we 'd have !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 32]: Most of it would have to go in useful things , but we 'd take a sovereign or two and have a reckless burst just to see what it was like .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 45]: A hansom to town , lunch at a real swagger restaurant ; and , after that , good seats at a _ matinee _ , ices between the acts , and another hansom home , instead of shivering at the corner waiting for omnibuses .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 4]: Oh , bliss !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 4]: Oh , rapture !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: If it could only come true !
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 20]: If uncle would once come to see us , he could n't help liking us ; could he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 17]: `` He 'd like me best , because I am pretty , '' said Ruth calmly .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 14]: `` He 'd like me best , because I am so nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 3]: contradicted Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 44]: And then they looked at each other , and each made a little grimace , supposed to express scorn and contempt , but in reality there was so complete an understanding beneath the pretence that it was almost as expressive as a caress .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 26]: After this came a few minutes ' silence , while the two needles were woven diligently to and fro ; then -- `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 12]: said Ruth suddenly , `` I 've come to a decision .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 28]: I 've been thinking it over for ages , so do n't imagine it 's a whim , or that I do n't mean what I say .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 33]: It 's time that one of us turned out and earned some money on our own account , and , as I 'm the eldest , I 'm the one to go .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 22]: Business gets worse and worse , and expenses increase , and must go on increasing , as the children grow up .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 35]: Trix will be sixteen in summer ; in less than two years she will leave school , and three grown-up daughters are not needed in any house when the mother is well and strong .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 31]: I once thought of waiting until then ; but I am twenty-two now , and , if I am to do any good , there is no time to waste .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 10]: You could get along without me even now . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 21]: The half-darned sock fell on Mollie 's knee , and for once the sunny face looked thoroughly shocked and startled .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 9]: `` I could n't -- I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 5]: None of us could !
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 9]: What would happen if everything depended on me ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 19]: You remind me , and keep me up to the mark , and help me out of scrapes .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 11]: I should be at my wit 's end without you .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 27]: Mother consults you about everything , and the girls obey you , and the boys pay more attention to you than they do to anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 9]: Ruth , _ everybody _ needs you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 11]: `` They love you best , '' Ruth said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 9]: And the dark brows wrinkled in wistful fashion .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 22]: It was the truth that she was speaking , no empty striving for compliments ; but why was it the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 7]: She worked hard ; Mollie idled .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 24]: She was conscientious , self-sacrificing , and methodical ; Mollie knew not the meaning of method , and was frankly selfish on occasions .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 39]: She worried herself ill about ways and means , and kept sedulously within the bounds of her small allowance ; Mollie took no heed for the morrow , and was in a chronic condition of penury or debt .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 47]: Despite these striking contrasts , the fact remained , however , that if any member of the household were ill , or had a secret to confide , or a favour to request , they betook themselves to the heedless Mollie , rather than to herself .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 19]: Dearly as she loved her sister , Ruth felt a little rankling of soreness mingling with her mystification .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 28]: She did not yet realise the magic power which cheerfulness wields in this world , or the charm of a sunny face and a ready rippling laugh .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 22]: Hearts turn to the sun as instinctively as plants , and forgive much for the sake of the warmth and glow .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 33]: `` They love you best , '' said Ruth , and honest Mollie did not contradict , but stretched out her hand , and laid it caressingly on her sister 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 16]: `` But I love you , and I ca n't do without you , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 15]: I could n't live alone , for you and I belong to each other .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 24]: The others are dears in their way ; but they are only ` steps , ' and we two seem so close together .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 5]: Imagine Attica without you !
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 19]: Imagine going to bed alone , with no one to talk to about the events of the day !
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 8]: What does the horrid old money matter ?
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 12]: We always have been poor , and we always shall be .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 28]: As long as I can remember mother has been in despair about the bills ; but we wriggle through somehow , and we shall go on wriggling .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: It 's horrid of you to talk of going away !
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 5]: Think of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 7]: `` That 's selfish , Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 13]: You are the last person I ought to think of just now .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 15]: Mother comes first , and the poor old pater , and all those children .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 18]: It comes to this , that I ca n't stand the present state of affairs any longer .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 44]: I feel ashamed of taking even the pittance we have ; and I 'm tired of the pittance , too , and want to make money for myself , and not have to think a dozen times over before spending a penny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 10]: Mollie laughed -- a pert , derisive little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 22]: `` Sounds well , my dear ; but , if it comes to that , what _ can _ you do ?
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 21]: You ca n't teach , for you are not accomplished enough for advanced pupils , nor patient enough for children .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 21]: Do you remember trying to teach Drummond to read , and rapping his poor little knuckles till they were blue ?
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 18]: Besides , talking of pittances , you 'd get less than nothing if you did try it .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 14]: I do n't see what you could do to earn a living . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 9]: `` I could be a hospital nurse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 28]: `` Perhaps you might -- a bad one -- for you do n't like nursing , and would only do it for the sake of the pay .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 14]: I should have no respect for you if you did that , Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 11]: It would be too hard on the unfortunate patients ? ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 35]: `` I could be a companion -- '' `` People who want companions are old , or gouty , or mad ; invariably disagreeable , or why have they to advertise for a friend ?
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 23]: I think I see you shut up with a trying old lady , combing the lap-dog 's hair , and winding wool !
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 12]: You would n't be a very agreeable companion , Ruthans dear .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 14]: Better make the best of things , and stay where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 16]: Ruth made no further protest , but her lips tightened with an expression of determination .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 15]: Her mind being made up , she was not easily swayed from her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 15]: She decided to talk to her mother on the subject on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: AN EVENING AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 34]: The father of Ruth and Mollie Farrell had died when the latter was two years old , leaving his wife but a few hundred pounds with which to support herself and her children .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 26]: She was a pretty , winsome creature , the sort of woman who attracts sympathy and love , but a most difficult person to help .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 28]: Friends came forward with suggestions and offers of assistance , and Mrs Farrell thanked them ardently , and wept , and agreed to all that they said .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 51]: In words , she was ready to undertake any exertion , however arduous ; but when it came to deeds , she was so weak , so incapable , so hopelessly confused , that the school , the boarding-house , and the home for Indian children ended successively in failure .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 45]: At the end of three years her scanty capital was almost exhausted ; but at this critical moment the Fates -- which seem to take special care of the helpless ones of the earth -- sent Ernest Connor to play the part of rescuer .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 45]: He was a round stone in a square hole , that is to say , a student by nature , who , by the exigencies of fortune , found himself doomed to a business life , wherein he was a painstaking but consistent failure .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 51]: Nervous and shy , he shrank from the society of women ; but it was impossible to be shy with the irresponsible little widow , who confided all her troubles to him on the first day of their acquaintance , and asked his advice with tears in her pretty eyes .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 29]: To his amazement , he found himself confiding his own troubles in return , and the ready sympathy accorded to them seemed the sweetest thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 29]: A month after their first meeting he asked her to be his wife , explaining honestly his financial position , and the uncertainty of improvement in the future .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 8]: `` But you will help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 15]: `` The money will go twice as far when you hold the purse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 12]: And Mrs Farrell agreed with ardour , unabashed by previous failures .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 32]: She went to her new home full of love and gratitude , and , let it be said at once , never had cause to regret the step in after years .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 24]: Ernest Connor was a devoted husband , and a most kindly father to the two little girls ; but life was not easy .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 43]: It was a constant strain to make ends meet , and as Trix , and Betty , and Drummond , and Ransome , and Bruce came in quick succession to fill the nursery , the strain grew even more and more acute .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 52]: The elder girls had been educated at a neighbouring high school , but left as soon as they were seventeen , and after that there was no money to spare for music and painting lessons , such as most girls continue as an interest and occupation long after schooldays are over .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 77]: Ruth and Mollie were kept busy teaching the babies and making clothes for the family -- cutting down Trix 's dress to do duty for Betty ; laboriously planning little pairs of knickers out of trousers worn at the knees ; patching , darning , covering-up , hiding over , turning and twisting ; making up something out of nothing , with the lordly sum of fifteen pounds a year each for dress and pocket-money alike .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 24]: They had never known the luxury , dear to girlish hearts , of choosing a garment simply because it was pretty or becoming .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 33]: Dark , useful remnants were their lot ; sailor-hats in summer , cloth toques in winter ; stout , useful boots , and dogskin gloves which stood a year 's hard wear .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 53]: Many a time over had Mollie stretched forth hands and feet for her sister 's inspection , quoting derisively -- '' ` Her thickly -- made country shoes could not conceal the slender contour of her ankles ; her rough gloves served only to reveal the patrician beauty of her hands . '
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 13]: Look at that , my love -- there 's contour for you !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 5]: There 's patrician beauty !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 12]: What rubbish those books do talk , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 54]: Many a time had the girls groaned together over their impecuniosity , and vaguely vowed to `` do something '' to remedy their condition , until at last Ruth 's unrest had reached the point of action , and she determined to seize the first opportunity of a private conference with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 16]: It was not easy to secure a _ tete-a-tete _ in the house of Connor .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 54]: On this particular evening , Trix was practising scales on the piano in the drawing-room , while Mollie read a novel , and Betty lolled on the rug ; the three boys were busy at lessons , or , as they eloquently described it , `` stewing , '' round the dining-room table .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 54]: Mr Connor was smoking his pipe and reading the evening papers in his den at the back of the house ; and the little , white-faced mother moved incessantly from room to room , no sooner settled in one place than she was seized with an anxious presentiment that she was needed elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 42]: She was pretty still , in a pathetic , faded manner ; and wherever she went she spoke loving , gentle words , and met loving glances in response : but , alas , her efforts seemed rather distracting than helpful !
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 100]: She stroked Drummond 's hair , and asked if he was sure his throat was better , just as he was on the point of completing a difficult addition ; she told her husband the tragic history of the cook 's impertinence , and handed him a heavy bill , when the poor man was enjoying the first quiet rest of the day ; she requested Mollie 's advice about spare-room curtains at the moment when long-separated lovers were united , and it was agony to lift one 's eyes from the page for the fraction of a second .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 64]: Husband and children alike answered gently and with courtesy , for , if there was little else , there was plenty of love in this shabby household , and the little mother was the central figure round which everything revolved ; nevertheless , her departure was marked by half - involuntary sighs of relief , as if a disturbing element had been withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 56]: Ruth knew that she would have to bide her time until the younger members of the family had retired to bed ; but , too restless to settle down to any definite occupation , she drifted across the drawing-room to where Trix sat , her fingers scrambling up and down the notes of the piano .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 39]: Trix was tall and lanky ; she had grey eyes , set far apart , a _ retrousse _ nose , dotted over with quite a surprising number of freckles , and an untidy shock of light-brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 36]: In years to come it was possible that she might develop into a pretty girl ; at the present moment she despised appearances , and certainly failed to make the best of her good points .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 35]: Now , as she sat by the piano-stool , with shoulders hunched up and head poked forward , she looked so awkward and ungainly that Ruth 's tried nerves suffered afresh at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 12]: `` For pity 's sake , sit up , Trix ! ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 4]: she cried sharply .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 12]: `` You look a perfect object , bent double like that !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 11]: You might be deformed , to look at your back !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 31]: If you go on like this , you will grow so round-shouldered that you wo n't be able to get straight again , and how will you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 42]: Trix deliberately finished her scale , then faced her sister , and retorted pertly -- `` Very much indeed , thank you -- if you will only realise that I _ ca n't _ help it , and leave me alone !
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 26]: I 'd rather be a humpback at once , than be worried morning , noon , and night about deportment , as I am now .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 15]: My back 's my own ; I can use it as I like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 17]: `` It 's wicked to talk like that , Trix , and very impertinent as well !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 15]: Who is to tell you of your faults if we do n't at home ?
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 16]: Other people look on , and say , ` What a fright that girl looks !
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 7]: How shockingly she carries herself ! '
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 26]: But they do n't trouble to tell you about it , and it is not very pleasant for us when you take it like this .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 35]: If we did not love you and care for your interests -- '' `` Oh dear me , '' sighed naughty Trix , `` then I wish you 'd love me a little less !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 18]: I could bear it quite well if you lost your interest , and left me in peace .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 23]: You and Mollie can do the beauty show for the family ; I am content to represent ` intellect and common-sense . '
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 19]: If you want something to do , you might help me with a French exercise instead of nagging .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 26]: It 's simply awful to-day ; and if I lose any more marks , it 's all up with my chance of getting a prize .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 13]: Now , then -- will you , or wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 29]: Trix 's method of asking favours was hardly as ingratiating as might be desired , and for a moment the chances seemed all in favour of a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 17]: The colour flamed in Ruth 's cheeks , and her black brows drew ominously near together .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 24]: She was fighting a hard battle against pride and resentment ; but , as was usually the case , the better self won .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 13]: She nodded back at Trix , and said -- `` I will !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 7]: ... Run and bring your books .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 26]: We wo n't venture into the dining-room , for the boys make such a noise that one ca n't hear one 's own voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 39]: There was something very sweet in the absolute surrender of self-will , and Trix , who was the most warm-hearted of mortals , promptly bounded up from her stool and flung her arms round her sister 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 7]: `` You duck -- you angel !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 20]: You shall nag at me as much as ever you like , and I 'll never be cheeky again .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 26]: It 's brickish of you to worry about me at all ; but I 'll always be a fright , so what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 10]: You are pretty enough for the family , Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 34]: Ella Bruce 's brother watches behind the curtains every Sunday to see you pass , and he says you are the prettiest girl he knows , and are always so nicely dressed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 14]: `` Poor , deluded mortal ; may he be forgiven for his blindness !
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 9]: I 'm the shabbiest creature in the parish !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 26]: It 's very nice of him to watch ; but I wish he would come out from behind the curtains and let me see him .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 17]: I have not so many admirers that I can afford to have them hidden from view .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 10]: What is he like , Trix ; handsome ? ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 6]: `` Oh , well enough !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 17]: Ella thinks him a model , but he is too thin and lanky for my taste .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 13]: He is not half good enough for you , Ruth , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 16]: You ought to marry a duke , and retrieve the fortunes of the family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 8]: `` I 'm willing , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 15]: Produce him , and I promise you I will not stand in the way .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 10]: I could do quite easily with being a duchess .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 25]: It would be so soothing to be called ` Your Grace , ' and a coronet is peculiarly suited to my style of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 17]: I wo n't have you for a bridesmaid , though , if you stoop like that .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 13]: Get your book , Trix , and let us set to work .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 12]: Better take advantage of my good mood while it lasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 53]: Trix departed obediently , and returned with a pile of books , which she dropped upon the table with a bang , which made the other occupants of the room start in their seats , and for the next hour the two girls wrestled with the difficulties of an advanced Brachet exercise .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 47]: Truth to tell , Ruth was not much more expert than Trix herself ; but she was infinitely more exact , and , by dint of hunting up back rules , and making endless references to the irregular verbs , the result achieved was fairly correct .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 5]: It was ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 39]: Betty and the three boys had departed to bed ; Mollie still sat gloating over her novel , with a forefinger thrust into either ear to shut out the sound of the disturbing discussion on moods and tenses .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 17]: Trix collected her books with a sigh , and prepared to go upstairs in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 20]: She looked white and tired , and the freckles on her nose seemed darker and more conspicuous than ever .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 6]: `` Good-night , old Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 5]: Thanks , most awfully !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: I 'll do as much for you some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: `` Good-night , young Trix !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 4]: Mind you do .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 10]: I shall remind you when the time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 19]: The door opened and closed ; Ruth rose wearily , and laid her hand on Mollie 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 25]: Such a charming face was lifted to meet her glance -- so fresh , so bright , full of such dazzling youth and vigour !
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 46]: True , Mollie had been lazing all the evening while the others worked ; but as Ruth stood looking down at her she wondered for the hundredth time how it was that so little was made of Mollie 's beauty in comparison with her own .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 56]: The golden hair rippled back in a thick , soft wave ; the grey eyes were large , and generously lashed ; the laughing lips parted , to show white , even , little teeth ; yet a stranger , looking for the first time at Mollie Farrell , rarely remarked upon her good looks .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 6]: `` What a nice girl !
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 5]: What a dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 6]: What a delightful creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 11]: they cried , according to their different degrees of enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 22]: They wanted to know her , to have her for a friend , and forgot to think of mere outward appearance .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 12]: `` What a noise you have been making , Ruth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 4]: said Mollie lazily .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 17]: `` I ca n't think why you ca n't be quiet when you get a chance !
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 8]: This book is too exciting for words .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 71]: I told you how the lovers quarrelled just after they were married , and he went abroad , thinking , of course , that she did n't love him any more ; while , of course , she simply adored the ground he trod on , but thought that he had grown tired of her , while he was more madly in -- '' Ruth gave an exclamation of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 6]: `` Oh , what rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 9]: I do n't believe such things are possible !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 33]: If they really loved each other , do you suppose they could keep on pretending while they lived together every day , and when it came to saying good-bye into the bargain ?
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 19]: She 'd break down and howl , and he would comfort her , and take off his coat .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 9]: Look here , Mollie -- go to bed !
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 21]: I 've waited all the evening to have a talk with mother , and you are the only impediment left .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 14]: Take your book with you if you like , -- but go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 6]: Mollie rose , unwillingly enough .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 20]: `` I know what you want to talk about , '' she said , looking into Ruth 's face .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 13]: `` I know ; and it 's not a mite of use .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 15]: Mother wo n't let you leave home ; she needs you far too much .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 21]: I sha n't go to sleep , for I shall want to hear every single word when you come upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 16]: I 'll snoodle up to the hot bottle , and read till you come . ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 46]: The programme sounded very attractive , -- to snoodle up to the hot bottle , and lie at ease reading an interesting book , -- much more attractive than to linger downstairs by the dying fire , and discuss disagreeable problems with an anxious mother .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 52]: But Ruth did not waver in her decision , and a few moments later Mrs Connor was caught paying a round of visits to the children 's bedrooms -- `` just in time , '' as Ruth thought whimsically , `` to waken the poor souls from their first sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 12]: -- and escorted back to the chair which Mollie had vacated .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 8]: `` Is anything wrong , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 4]: she asked nervously .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 26]: Poor little woman , if a surprise were in store , it seemed so much more likely that it should be disagreeable rather than bright !
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 33]: `` You do n't feel feverish , or ill , or -- '' `` No , no , my dear ; I just want to talk to you about my own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 34]: I 'm quite well , and so strong and -- and grown-up , do n't you know , that it is time I grew independent , and began life on my own account .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 33]: You have Mollie at home , and Trix and Betty growing up , and I think , mother dear , that I ought not to be dependent on the pater any longer .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 31]: He has been very good and kind to us all these years ; but , still -- '' She hesitated , and Mrs Connor looked at her with anxious tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 63]: She had honestly considered the welfare of her two little girls as much as her own when she decided to marry a second time , and it had been a constant joy to feel that her expectations had been fulfilled ; yet here was Ruth , her firstborn darling , her right hand in household affairs , actually talking of leaving home !
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 8]: `` Are n't you happy , Ruth ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: Have you not been happy all these years ?
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 10]: I thought you were quite content and satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 30]: She sighed ; and Ruth gave an echoing sigh , and answered honestly -- `` Quite happy , darling , as far as you and the pater are concerned .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 17]: He could not have been kinder to us if we had been his very own daughters .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 3]: But satisfied ?
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 13]: Oh no , mother ; never satisfied for a long time back !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 5]: How could I be ?
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 46]: I do n't want to seem ungrateful ; but I 'm only twenty - one , and it has been all work and no play , and there are so many , many things that I want to do , and see , and feel .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 49]: I 've never been to a proper grown-up dance in my life , for if we have been asked we have not had decent clothes to go in , and we never invite anyone here , so now people have given over asking us even to quiet evenings .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 32]: I hardly ever speak to a soul outside this house , and I get so tired of it all ; -- and only fifteen pounds a year for dress and pocket-money !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 40]: Remember what your allowance was when you were a girl , and all the jolly times you had , and the parties , and the visits , and the trips abroad , -- and then think of our lives .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 15]: It _ is _ dull for us , is n't it , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 12]: Mrs Connor 's pale cheeks flushed with a touch of offence .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 30]: Not having sufficient insight into girls ' natures to understand that there was nothing either undutiful or unnatural in Ruth 's lament , she felt herself personally injured thereby .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 10]: `` Mollie is happy -- Mollie is content ! ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 4]: she said briefly .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 15]: And Ruth assented with a brief `` Yes , '' and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 26]: If the difference between Mollie 's nature and her own was not patent to their own mother , it was useless to enlarge upon it .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 23]: She waited a moment or two to regain composure , then continued quietly -- `` But that was not exactly the point .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: I did not mean to speak of my own troubles .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 24]: What I feel is that when business is so bad , it is not right for two grown-up girls to stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 34]: You could get on without me , with a little extra help for sewing , and in time I might earn enough , not only to keep myself but to help the others .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 12]: Honestly , now , do n't you think I am right ?
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 30]: In my place , would you not feel it your duty to the pater to be independent , and lighten his responsibility , if even by a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 36]: Mrs Connor sat silent , torn between two thoughts -- dread of parting from Ruth , and a longing to help the overburdened husband , who had come as a rescuer in her own need .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 32]: No one but herself guessed how it tore her heart to present him with fresh bills , or to ask for money for all the thousand-and-one needs of a growing family .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 30]: Her very dread and nervousness made her choose inappropriate moments for her requests , and Mr Connor 's aloofness from the ordinary workaday world made matters still more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 36]: He probably considered fifteen pounds a year a lordly dress allowance for his two step-daughters ; certainly he would not have noticed if they had worn the same garments every day for years on end .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 18]: His own clothes lasted him for an incredible period , and were always neatly brushed and folded .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 14]: It did not occur to him that girls needed more change than himself .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 6]: Mrs Connor sat and pondered .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 32]: It was terrible to think of parting from Ruth , but the strain of making both ends meet was becoming so acute that some method of retrenchment must inevitably be found .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 62]: It is easy for rich people to cut down expenses -- to give up carriage and horses , dismiss two or three servants , and indulge in fewer pleasures and excitements ; but it is a very different matter when there are no superfluities with which to part , but only , as it seems , the barest necessaries of life .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 22]: Mrs Connor 's eyes filled slowly with tears as she stretched out her hand and laid it over her daughter 's .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 22]: It was the signal of capitulation , and Ruth recognised it as such , and felt a sinking of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 10]: `` You will let me go , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 14]: And Mrs Connor answered brokenly -- `` If I must , I must !
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: You would come home for the holidays : we should not lose you altogether .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 8]: But oh , Ruth , not yet !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 8]: Wait until the beginning of the term .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 39]: Years ago , when things were at their very worst with me , and I did not know where to turn for help , God sent my dear husband to take care of me and you two babies .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 8]: Perhaps -- perhaps something may happen again .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 12]: Perhaps , after all , it may not be necessary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 12]: They kissed each other silently , and parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 29]: Half-way upstairs Ruth remembered that her mother had not once inquired as to the nature of the work she intended to undertake , and smiled whimsically to herself .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 14]: It was so very characteristic of the irresponsible little mistress of the household !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 6]: A PROPOSAL AND A REFUSAL .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 37]: It was tacitly understood in the household that after Easter Ruth was going to do `` something '' to retrieve the family fortunes , but what that `` something '' should be remained vague and undefined .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 37]: Ruth herself debated the question morning , noon , and night , and , like many another poor girl in the same position , bitterly regretted an education which had given her no one marketable qualification .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 34]: She could play a little , draw a little , speak French a little , speak German a little less , make her own clothes in amateur fashion , and -- what else ?
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 13]: Nothing at all that any able-bodied woman could not accomplish equally well .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 47]: If she had concentrated her energies on one definite thing , and learnt to do it , not pretty well , nor very well , but just as well as it could possibly be done , what a different prospect would have stretched before her now !
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 66]: If she decided to teach , she must be content to accept juvenile pupils and a poor salary ; if she became a companion , she must sacrifice all spirit of independence , and become a dutiful drudge , while she knew in her inmost heart that it would be wrong to take up nursing , since she felt no real vocation for the task .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 41]: It was useless to ask advice of anyone at home , so , one afternoon , Ruth betook herself to almost the only intimate friend she possessed , -- a middle-aged spinster who kept house for an adored doctor brother .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 37]: The brother was a friend into the bargain -- a tall , thin , clever -- looking man of thirty-eight , engrossed in his practice , which was one of the most prosperous in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 24]: Brother and sister were seated at tea together when Ruth was announced , and she looked round the pretty room with admiring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 48]: Pink silk lamp-shades , luxurious cushions , bowls of spring flowers , a tea equipage , bright and dainty and complete , -- oh , how delightful it all looked after the bare shabbiness of the room at home ; and what fascinating clothes Eleanor was wearing !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 47]: Despite her affection , one-and-twenty was inclined to think pretty things thrown away upon an antediluvian creature of forty , but if Ruth could have had a glimpse of herself as `` others saw her '' at that moment , she might have been more content .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 40]: The subdued lamp-light dealt kindly with the old blue serge coat and skirt , the pink scarf at her neck matched the colour on her cheeks , and the eyes underneath the black brows were unusually bright and animated .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 52]: She was always a welcome guest at this hospitable house , and it was a pleasant variety to be petted and fussed over , provided with cushions and footstools , and tempted to eat by a fresh supply of hot buttered scones and a delectable chocolate cake studded over with walnuts .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 10]: Ruth laughed , and dimpled into ever brighter beauty .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 34]: `` It makes me feel so nice and young , '' she cried , `` as if I were a spoilt only child , instead of the staid eldest daughter of a family !
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 36]: But I ought to be staid ; I ca n't afford to frivol any longer , for I am going to take a most important step , and start life on my own account . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 21]: Brother and sister alike looked up with sharp inquiry , and Ruth , understanding , broke into a merry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: `` Oh , not that !
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 5]: Nothing half so interesting !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 24]: Merely going to earn my living , and I came to ask your advice as to how I had best set about it .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 25]: Nothing is decided so far , except that I am to earn enough money to keep myself , and contribute largely to home expenses .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 16]: That 's the end , but the puzzle is to find out the means . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 5]: `` Poor lassie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 5]: said Miss Maclure gently .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 33]: She had a soft , Scotch burr in her voice , and her plain face was full of an almost motherly kindness as she looked at the pretty girl across the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 37]: She had private means of her own , and her brother was a prosperous man ; but she knew enough of the world to understand the nature of the struggle of which Ruth spoke so lightly .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 14]: `` It 's easier saying than doing , I 'm afraid , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 25]: There are so many women searching for work nowadays , and for many positions it is necessary to prepare by long and expensive training .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 47]: We wanted a lady secretary for one of the societies in which I am interested , and we had hundreds of applicants who were expert typists and stenographers , and had all sorts of diplomas to show , but you have nothing of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 11]: `` No , nor a penny to spend on training .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 13]: I must be taken as I am , or not at all .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: Do n't discourage me , Eleanor , please .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 15]: Mollie runs the cold tap persistently at home , and I really need appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 19]: There must be _ something _ that I can do , if I set my wits to work .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 33]: I am not going to be a nurse , Dr Maclure , so do n't think that I am leading up to a request that you should get me into a hospital .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 34]: I do n't like sick people unless they are my very own , and it would be almost as dull to be shut up in a hospital as to remain at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 25]: Miss Maclure looked a trifle shocked at this candid confession , but her brother laughed , and said approvingly -- `` That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 5]: I admire your honesty .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 29]: We have far too many nurses who take up the work without any real fitness , and I should be sorry to see you added to the number .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 6]: Well , let me see !
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 19]: ... After hospital nursing , the next most popular resort is to turn author and write a novel .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 9]: Have you any leaning in that direction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 14]: He looked across at Ruth with a humorous twitching of his clean-shaven lips .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 45]: Once again she felt conscious that the Maclures looked upon her as a pretty child , to be petted and humoured rather than a serious woman of the world , and once again the knowledge brought with it a feeling of rest and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 22]: She crinkled her brows and smiled back at the doctor , answering frankly -- `` Oh yes , plenty of leanings !
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 55]: I should love to write , and Mollie and I are always ` imagining ' to make life more lively and exciting ; but , when it comes to sitting down with a pen in my hand , my thoughts seem to take wing and fly away , and the words wo n't come .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 15]: They are all stiff and formal , and wo n't express what I want .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 19]: Mollie gets on better , for she writes as she talks , so it 's natural at least .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 42]: She wrote quite a long story once , and read it aloud to me as she went on , but it was never finished , and I do n't think for a moment that any paper would have looked at it .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 19]: The people were all lords and dukes and millionaires , and we do n't know even a knight .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 9]: I expect it was full of mistakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 9]: Dr Maclure smiled and rose from his seat .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 44]: `` Well , I have some letters to write , so I will leave you to have your talk with Eleanor ; but I am starting off again on my rounds in half an hour , and shall be driving past your house .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 6]: It is a disagreeable evening .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 10]: Will you let me give you a lift ? ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 4]: Ruth consented eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 39]: The blue serge coat felt none too warm in the bleak east wind , and it would be a relief to be spared the chilly walk , and be bowled along instead in the doctor 's luxurious brougham .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 34]: She drew her chair nearer to the fire , and proceeded to confide various whys and wherefores to the sympathetic Eleanor -- sympathetic , but hardly responsive this afternoon for some mysterious reason .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 40]: The while Ruth set forward one idea after another , Miss Maclure sat gazing at her with an intent , questioning gaze , as though too much occupied with her own thoughts to grasp the meaning of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 30]: Ruth felt chilled and disappointed , for during the last few days the constant thought in the background of her mind had been , `` Eleanor will advise me !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 8]: Eleanor will know what to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 15]: Miss Maclure was a busy woman , whose name figured in a dozen committees .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 20]: She knew everyone , went everywhere , and her word had weight in guilds , societies , and associations .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 29]: What could be more easy than for her to find a pleasant and lucrative berth for a pet girl friend , and settle her in it without delay ?
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 42]: Ruth had already imagined a touching scene wherein she had been introduced to her future sphere of work , while those in authority overpowered Miss Maclure with thanks for helping them to find the ideal person to fill the vacant post .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 18]: But Eleanor said nothing , suggested nothing , only sat staring with those grave , questioning eyes !
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 20]: It was almost a relief when the half-hour was over , and the doctor gave the summons for departure .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 19]: Then Eleanor came back to the present once more , and was all that was kind and loving .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 10]: `` Have you no wraps with you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 8]: Is that all you have on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 40]: she asked , as the girl buttoned her thin coat and pulled the scarf higher round her throat ; and Ruth answered `` Yes , '' in an irresponsive tone , which effectually put a stop to further remarks .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 27]: She might speak of her own poverty , but not even Eleanor Maclure herself could be allowed to pity , or offer to supply a want .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 36]: That was Miss Ruth 's idea of proper pride , and she straightened her back , and held her head higher than ever as she crossed the hall and took her seat in the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 32]: Such a luxurious brougham it was , with its well-cushioned seats , its electric reading-lamp attached to the wall , its rack for books and papers , and cosy fur rug !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 26]: Ruth tucked the rug securely in position , and , looking up , caught the reflection of her face in the strip of mirror opposite .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 23]: The blue serge toque sat so jauntily on her head that it looked quite smart ; the pink tie was undoubtedly becoming .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 13]: Well , it was a comfort to be pretty , at least !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 13]: To have been poor and plain would have been quite too depressing .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 26]: She smiled back in approving fashion , to feel somewhat disconcerted a moment later as the mirror reflected Donald Maclure 's face beside her own .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 32]: He was staring at her with the same intent questioning which she had noticed in Eleanor 's eyes , and surely he looked paler , older , more haggard than usual !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 20]: She turned towards him , warmed into increased friendship by the presentiment that he was in trouble like herself .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 15]: `` It 's so good of you to take me home , Dr Maclure !
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 23]: It may seem curious to you , but it 's quite a treat to me to drive about in this comfy carriage .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 10]: I so seldom travel in anything but shaky omnibuses .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 23]: I should not object to being a lady doctor , if I could have a brougham like this of my very own .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 16]: We never thought of that when we were discussing my possible fields of labour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 12]: Dr Maclure bent forward , and glanced out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 24]: His horse was travelling quickly to-night ; in another ten minutes Mr Connor 's house would be reached , and his opportunity over .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 29]: He turned to face his companion , and said quietly -- `` There is another possibility open to you , Ruth , which you have perhaps not considered .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: Have you ever thought of it , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 8]: Can you guess what I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 10]: The grey eyes stared into his in frankest bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 10]: `` No , '' cried Ruth -- `` no !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 3]: Something nice ?
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 7]: Tell me what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 26]: `` You have never guessed that I love you ; that I have loved you for years , since you were a girl at school ?
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 11]: You have never once guessed it all this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 25]: He read his answer in the blank face and startled eyes , for Ruth was too utterly taken aback to feel the usual embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 21]: She sat perfectly still , gazing not at him but at the reflection of his face in the mirror opposite .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: Dr Maclure !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 18]: Was she dreaming , or was it really his voice which she heard uttering these extraordinary words ?
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 11]: Dr Maclure loved her -- had loved her for years !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 8]: It was too inconceivable to be grasped !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 63]: He asked if she had not guessed his secret , but Ruth had not thought of him at all ; he had not entered into her calculations except as `` Eleanor 's brother '' -- a nonentity who might be agreeable or the reverse , according as he drove her home on wet evenings , or interrupted a cosy _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 34]: She did not reply to the question in words ; but he was answered all the same , for she heard him sigh , and saw a quiver pass across the thin face .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 12]: `` I am too old , Ruth -- is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 11]: You never thought of me as a possible lover ? ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 7]: `` Oh no , never once !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 17]: You always seemed so busy and occupied , and you have Eleanor to look after you .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 22]: You have always been very kind to me , but you were kind to Mollie and Trix and Betty as well .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 12]: I did not feel that you treated me differently from them .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 21]: You are so clever ; and you saw yourself , when we talked this afternoon , I can do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 13]: -- I do n't see how you can possibly like me . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 4]: he asked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 15]: `` But I do , Ruth ; I care more than I can express .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 12]: I have not spoken before , for you seemed too young .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 17]: I should not have spoken to-day if you had not told us of this new move .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 42]: You do n't know how hard it is for a girl to go out into the world and earn her living ; but I do , and I should like to save you from it , if it can be done .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 18]: I could give you a comfortable home , and enough money to make life easy and pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 11]: It would be my best happiness to see you happy .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 15]: We could travel ; you would be able to help Mollie and the rest .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 38]: If you married me , your people would be my people , and I should be as anxious as yourself to let them share our good fortune ; and I would love you very dearly , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 28]: I seem old to you , perhaps , but my love would be more proved and certain than if I were a boy of your own age .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 28]: I am a prosperous man , but I want something more from life than I have had so far -- something that you alone can give roe .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 10]: You hold my key to happiness , Ruth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 17]: Ruth drew back into the corner of the carriage and turned her face into the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 5]: She wanted to think .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 18]: What an extraordinary change in the outlook at life to have happened in a few brief moments !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 5]: Dr Maclure 's wife !
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 20]: Here was an answer indeed to the question which had been occupying her thoughts for the last few weeks !
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 14]: Suppose -- suppose , just for one moment , that she said yes ?
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 30]: Suppose that on getting home she walked into the dining-room and announced her engagement to a prosperous and charming man , who was already a family friend and favourite ?
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 3]: What fun !
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 3]: What excitement !
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 18]: What pride on the part of the little mother ; what transparent relief to the overtaxed pater !
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 36]: Mollie and Trix would begin at once to discuss bridesmaids ' dresses , and there would be a trousseau to buy , and all the bustle and excitement of a first marriage in a family .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 3]: And afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 31]: A big , handsomely appointed house , pretty clothes , lots of money , the power to help those whom she loved ... It sounded good -- very good indeed !
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 19]: Much more attractive than those nursery governess and companion schemes which she dreaded , despite all her resolutions .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 23]: It would be delightful to be her own mistress , and do just as she liked ... And then a thought occurred .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 4]: What of Eleanor ?
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 28]: Ruth recalled the intent gaze which had mystified her so much during the afternoon , and felt convinced that Miss Maclure had guessed her brother 's secret .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 8]: What was her feeling in the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 29]: Was she jealous of a rival in her brother 's affections , or loyally anxious for his happiness , regardless of how her own future might be affected ?
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 17]: A spasm of curiosity found voice in a sudden question -- `` But there is Eleanor .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 11]: If you married , what would become of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: `` There would be no difficulty about that .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 30]: When we took up house together we made a solemn agreement that if either wished to marry in the future the other should not hinder in any possible way .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 18]: Eleanor has her own income , and many interests in life to keep her happy and occupied .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 22]: She would live near us , I hope , but you should be entire mistress of your home , Ruth . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 37]: He evidently thought she had looked upon his sister 's presence in the house as a hindrance to her happiness , but , in truth , Ruth felt a chilly sinking of heart at his reply .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 21]: The thought of the big house was not half so attractive , shorn of the figure of the sympathetic friend .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 39]: The library with no Eleanor sitting writing at her desk ; the drawing-room with no Eleanor in the deep-cushioned chair ; the dining-room with no Eleanor at the head of the table -- how blank it all seemed !
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 18]: How dreadfully dull to be alone all day , with only the doctor to break the monotony !
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 4]: Only the doctor !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 20]: The blood rushed in a flood to Ruth 's cheeks as she realised the significance of that one word .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 15]: She turned impetuously towards her companion , and gripped his arm with nervous pressure .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 7]: `` Do n't tempt me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 10]: she cried earnestly -- `` do n't tempt me !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 25]: There are so many things that I should like , and I keep thinking of them , when I should think only of you .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: -- I 'd love to be rich , and have a nice house , and play Lady Bountiful at home !
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 47]: I 'd love to travel about and see the world , instead of jogging along in one little rut ; and , really and truly , I dread turning out to work , and am a coward at heart -- but , -- that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 21]: I have always liked you very much as a friend , but I ca n't imagine ever feeling any different .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 16]: When I was thinking over things just now , I -- do n't be angry !
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 25]: I do n't want to hurt you , only to be quite , quite honest -- I thought more of Eleanor than of you !
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 9]: I hardly thought of you at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 21]: The doctor 's thin face looked very drawn and pained , but he smiled in response to her pleading glance .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 8]: `` I 'm not angry , dear .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 5]: Why should I be ?
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 23]: It is not your fault that you do not care , and it is best for us both to know the truth .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 7]: I feared it might be so .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 26]: I am too old and staid to attract a bright young girl , but I even now can not bring myself to regret my love .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 28]: It has given me the happiest hours of my life , and I hope you will always let me help you in any way that is possible .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 15]: I think you owe me that privilege , do n't you , Ruth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do -- I do !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 30]: If it is any pleasure to you , I promise faithfully to come to you whenever I need a friend , and I should like you to help me .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 12]: That means a great deal , for I am horribly proud .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 14]: There are very few people from whom I can accept a favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 33]: He smiled again , but with an evident effort , and Ruth , peeping at his averted profile , felt a pang of real personal suffering at the sight of his pain .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 32]: It seemed dreadful that she should have such power to affect this strong man ; to take the light out of his face and make it old and worn and grey !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 29]: The carriage was nearing home ; in a few minutes ' time the drive would be over , and she would have no chance of continuing the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 20]: With a sudden swelling of the heart she realised that she could not part without another expression of regret .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 14]: `` I am so sorry , so dreadfully sorry to have grieved you !
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 33]: But you would not like me to marry you just for what you could give me ; you would not have been satisfied with that , would you , Dr Maclure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 10]: His eyes met hers with a flash of determination .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 12]: `` No , '' he cried -- unhesitatingly -- `` never !
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 14]: I want a wife who loves me , or no wife at all !
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 31]: One never knows what lies ahead in this world , and if dark days come I should like to feel that she cared for me more , rather than less .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 23]: It would be hard for us both if she valued only my possessions , and they took to themselves wings and fled .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 9]: And there is your own future to consider .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 17]: Love will come to you some day , and you must be free to welcome him .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 16]: Do n't distress yourself about me , Ruth ; I have my work for consolation .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 24]: Before I get home to-night I shall have seen so much suffering that I shall be ashamed to nurse my own trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Ruth faintly .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 27]: His words seemed to place her at an immense distance , as if already he had accepted his burden and put it resolutely out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 63]: She felt chilled and humiliated , for in the depths of her heart she knew that if Dr Maclure had been persistent in his request , and had condescended to `` tempt '' her , to use her own expressive phrase , she would very probably have succumbed to the temptation , however much she might have regretted her decision later on .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 23]: But Donald would have none of her ; he wanted a wife who cared for himself , and not for his possessions .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 14]: Ruth felt almost as if it were she herself who had been refused .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 13]: It was not an agreeable sensation to experience after a first proposal .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 3]: A MEETING .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 54]: One bright spring afternoon about a week after Ruth 's visit to Miss Maclure , Mollie went out to execute some shopping commissions , and on her way home took a short cut through the park , which was the great summer resort of the northern town in which her lot was cast .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 39]: She was an ardent lover of Nature , and it was a joy to see the tiny green buds bursting into life on trees and hedges , and to realise that the long winter was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 14]: `` Nasty , shivery , chilblainey thing , -- I hate it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 11]: said Mollie to herself , with a shiver of disgust .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 26]: `` It might be very nice if one had lots of furs , and skating , and parties , and fires in one 's bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 30]: People who can enjoy themselves like that may talk of the ` joys of winter , ' but , from my point of view , they do n't exist .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 12]: Give me summer , and flowers at a penny a bunch !
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 13]: This dear old park and I have had many good times together .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 14]: I think I have sampled most of the seats in my time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 56]: It was , indeed , a favourite summer custom of the Farrell girls to repair to a shady bench under a tree with such portable sewing as happened to be on hand , for when the sun shone in its strength the temperature of Attica was more like that of an oven than a room .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 40]: The winding paths were , therefore , familiar to Mollie ; but they were apt to be puzzling to strangers who , like herself , wished to take a short cut from one side of the park to another .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 46]: To-day as she approached the junction of four cross-ways , she saw before her the figure of an old man , glancing irresolutely from side to side , then turning round , as though in search of someone whom he could consult in his perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 34]: Besides Mollie herself , there was no one in sight , so she quickened her pace and approached the stranger with the bright , frank smile which came so readily to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 43]: Mollie was nothing if not sociable ; she never lost a chance of talking if it came in her way ; even to direct wandering old gentlemen was more amusing than nothing , and this one had such a curious old-world appearance !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: `` Can I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 25]: she asked brightly ; and the old man planted his stick more firmly on the ground , and stared at her with grim disfavour .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 20]: `` In what way , may I ask , do I appear to be in need of help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 23]: It was decidedly a snub , but some people are not easily quelled , and Mollie Farrell was one of the number .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 18]: Instead of being annoyed , she was simply amused , and her grey eyes twinkled with mischief .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 11]: He was a cross old dear , and proud too !
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 17]: quite amazed that anyone should suppose it possible that he should need assistance of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 28]: `` I 'm sorry , '' she replied ; `` I thought you had lost your way , and that I might be able to direct you .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: Please forgive me for seeming to interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 18]: She took a step forward , but the old man 's eyes seemed to hold her back .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 39]: He was looking at her fixedly beneath his heavy brows ; such bushy , black eyebrows they were , and she fancied that the grim expression softened for a moment as he replied -- `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 8]: I _ have _ lost my way !
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 28]: My cabman brought me to the park gates , and as he said there was a direct path across , I thought I should like the walk .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: As a result , I find myself completely out of my reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 14]: It is a stretch of imagination to call this a direct path . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 29]: `` Oh , it 's direct enough when you know it , '' said Mollie easily , `` ever so much nicer than going round by the streets .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 14]: It is a beautiful park , and we are very proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 22]: When the trees are in blossom , it is like fairyland -- you ca n't imagine how beautiful it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 10]: `` Possibly not , '' returned the stranger curtly .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 32]: `` In the meantime , however , there is nothing particularly alluring in the scene , and you will excuse my reminding you that we are standing in a direct draught .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 17]: I should be obliged if you could direct me to Langton Terrace without further delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 4]: Mollie laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 23]: `` That is just what I have been waiting to do , but you would not tell me where you were bound .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 22]: I am walking in that direction myself , and if you will allow me I will show you the shortest cut .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 25]: I know the park so well that I can dodge about from one path to another , and cut off some of the corners .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 15]: It is cold just here , but the cross-roads are sheltered even now . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 25]: The stranger shrugged his shoulders , and said `` Humph '' in an incredulous manner , and that was his sole reply in words .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 41]: He turned , however , and walked by Mollie 's side , leaning heavily on his stick , and taking such short , laboured steps , that it was evident that the exercise was almost too much for his strength .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 25]: Mollie longed to offer him the support of her strong arm , but even her audacity failed at the sight of the grim face .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 20]: She looked inquiringly at his feet , for the symptoms of temper all hinted to the explanation of gout .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 16]: there were no cloth shoes to be seen , only the trimmest of well-polished boots .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 21]: `` Perhaps he is just recovering from an attack , or sickening for another , '' said Mollie to herself .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 28]: `` Anyway , he is ill , poor old fellow , for his face looks quite grey , just like that poor Mr Burgess before he died .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 9]: I expect he ca n't help being cross .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 12]: I should be horrid myself if I were always in pain .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 37]: I remember that day I had on those new boots that hurt my feet , I quarrelled with Ruth all the way home ... The question is , shall I talk , or let him alone ?
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 18]: If it were me , I 'd like to be amused , to make the time pass .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 12]: I 'll try anyway , and see how he responds . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 45]: They had entered one of the smaller paths by this time , and to the right lay the wide , grey surface of a lake dotted over by little islands , the largest of which was connected with the shore by an ornamental bridge .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 30]: Mollie felt a kind of possessive pride in the scene , and pointed out the beauties thereof as eagerly as though she were the owner of all she surveyed .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 27]: `` It 's the largest lake in any of the parks in the north ; some people say it is nearly as big as the Serpentine .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 13]: I do n't know , for I have never been in London .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 20]: In summer-time hundreds of men come and sail boats -- quite great big boats -- from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: It looks so pretty to see all the white sails floating about in the sunshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: -LRB- `` Does n't care for boats .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 8]: I 'll try something else . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 14]: `` Do you see that big island , the biggest of all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: pursued the indefatigable Mollie aloud .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 7]: `` It is full of peacocks .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 8]: There are dozens and dozens of peacocks !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 21]: You can see them sometimes strutting about with their tails spread out , and roosting right up in the trees .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 11]: People say that peacocks are the laziest birds in existence .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 15]: They go to rest earlier , and get up later than anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 11]: Still grimmer silence ; still slower and more halting footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 19]: Presently the stranger stopped short and asked abruptly -- `` How far are we still from Langton Terrace ?
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 8]: Five minutes ' walk -- ten minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 10]: We are more than half-way , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 8]: `` Not quite , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 17]: If you are tired , would you not rest on this seat for a few minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: It is really quite sheltered behind the trees .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 29]: If you can tell me which end of the terrace you want to reach , it will make a little difference in the way we ought to take .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 16]: There are three blocks of houses , which are all known by the same name .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 24]: You wanted to go to -- '' `` Number 7 , '' said the stranger ; and sat down heavily upon the seat .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 32]: He leant both hands on his stick and rested his chin upon them , as though thankful for the support ; and Mollie stood before him staring fixedly at his face .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 29]: Aquiline features , sharpened by suffering into yet finer lines , closely - set lips drooping out into lines of fretful impatience , sunken eyes beneath overhanging brows .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 22]: She studied them one by one , until , struck by her silence , the old man looked up in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 7]: `` Number 7 , I said .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 19]: If you live in the neighbourhood , you may know the house , and possibly its inmates ? ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 18]: `` Yes , I know them all ; they are nice people and very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 11]: I 've known them quite a number of years . ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 20]: `` Mr and Mrs Connor have a large family , I believe -- a number of young children . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 6]: `` Oh , dozens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 4]: replied Mollie easily .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 16]: She was enjoying herself intensely , but trying to preserve an appearance of innocent calm .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 19]: `` What an adventure , '' she was saying to herself -- `` oh , what an adventure .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: What fun to tell it all to Ruth and the girls !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 15]: I must remember every word , so as to repeat it in style ! ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 18]: Aloud , she added carelessly , `` There are two girls , and lots of little boys .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 37]: It seems as if there were boys , boys everywhere , wherever you turn all over the house ; but they are ubiquitous creatures , so perhaps there are not quite so many as it seems .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 12]: They are handsome little fellows , and I believe clever too .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 14]: Mrs Connor is a very pretty woman , and always kind and gentle .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 4]: Everybody likes her .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 6]: Mr Connor is nice too .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 23]: I do n't think he is at all strong , and he has to work very hard for that big family . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 18]: The strange old man did not display the slightest sign of sympathy for Mr Connor 's anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 18]: He relaxed his hold of the stick , and sank wearily against the back of the seat .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 17]: `` There are two step - daughters , I believe -- the two Miss Farrells ? ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 4]: exclaimed Mollie deeply .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 20]: It was quite a tragic note , as who should say , `` Now we are beginning to talk !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 14]: Now , at last , we reach the real point of the discussion !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 19]: Just that deep ` Ah , ' and no more , until perforce another question must be asked .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 9]: `` You know the Miss Farrells also ? ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 14]: `` And find them as attractive as the rest of the family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 8]: `` Oh , more -- much more !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 5]: They are darlings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 11]: cried Mollie , with unction , `` especially the younger .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 17]: Her name is Mary , but they call her Mollie , because it suits her better .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 17]: Do n't you always imagine a Mollie very sweet , and charming , and attractive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 15]: `` I ca n't say that I have devoted any attention to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 12]: So Mary is the younger of the two , is she ?
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 5]: And the elder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 3]: `` Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 21]: she 's pretty and serious , and very , very nice ; but Mollie is nicer , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 19]: When you get to know them , you must promise to like Mollie best , for my sake !
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 16]: I 'm so fond of her , that I want everybody to be the same .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 11]: I like her better than anyone I ever knew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 6]: The old man smiled grimly .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 28]: `` You appear to be of an enthusiastic temperament ; I fancy I shall prefer to judge for myself when I make the young lady 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 8]: We had better be getting on now .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 22]: I am sorry to hinder your progress , but it is not possible for me to move more quickly at present .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 29]: I should not have attempted the walk if I had known that it was so long ; but the cab jolted insufferably , and the sunshine was tempting .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 15]: Well , -- there is nothing for it but to make another effort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 35]: He pressed his hands on the seat to lighten the effort of rising , but before he had got any further , Mollie stepped forward eagerly , and laid a hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 13]: Her cheeks were flushed with colour , her eyes a-sparkle with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 9]: `` Unless you will let me help you !
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 23]: ... I 'm very strong ; I could support you easily , if you would take my arm and lean on me .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 7]: I 'd love to do it .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 4]: Do let me ?
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 11]: Wo n't you , -- _ Uncle Bernard _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 3]: AN INVITATION .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 15]: The old man fell backward on the seat with an exclamation of keenest surprise .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 32]: His sunken eyes stared into Mollie 's face as she bent over him ; at the golden hair curling beneath the dark toque , the grey eyes , the curving lips .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 21]: Each feature in turn was scrutinised as if he were searching for something familiar which had so far escaped notice .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 27]: Apparently it was not discovered , for the expression of amazement deepened upon his face , and he asked sharply -- `` What did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 8]: _ What _ did you call me ?
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 10]: I do n't understand what you can mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 14]: Mollie sat down on the bench , and smiled brightly into his face .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 4]: `` Uncle Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 6]: You are Uncle Bernard Farrell !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 23]: I knew you the moment you said that you were going to Number 7 , and asked if I knew the Connors .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 23]: Of course I know them , because I am -- '' She hesitated , and Mr Farrell finished the sentence for her .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 10]: `` You are one of Mr Connor 's daughters .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 6]: The eldest , I presume .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 11]: I have not the pleasure of knowing your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 3]: `` No-o !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 5]: I am not Trix .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 8]: She is a child , only fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 8]: I was nineteen on my last birthday .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 30]: I am , '' -- for once in her life Mollie had the grace to blush , and looked a trifle discomposed -- `` I 'm Mollie Farrell . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 15]: The glance which the old man cast upon her was the reverse of flattering .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 10]: `` You are Mollie Farrell , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 4]: he repeated coldly .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 13]: `` Evidently modesty is not one of your failings , young lady .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 17]: It might have been wiser if you had allowed me to discover your attractions for myself .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 39]: Do you consider it quite honest -- we will not discuss the question of good taste -- to play a double part , and criticise your relations to any stranger whom you may meet in your walks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 9]: `` You asked me ; you began it !
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 14]: I should not have mentioned them if you had not asked that question .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 12]: Then I recognised you , and thought it would be fun .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 15]: You were not a stranger , you see ; you were Uncle Bernard . ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 24]: `` That may be my name , but as I have never seen you before , I can hardly rank as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 13]: May I ask how you came to recognise me at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 4]: `` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 33]: We have your portraits at home , and mother often talks of you , and the happy times she had when she used to visit you with father when they were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 79]: When we were children it was a favourite game for one of us to be Uncle Bernard , and the other guests staying at the Court , and we used to go through all the adventures which father had as a boy , -- fall into the mill-stream and be rescued by the dog , and be chased by the bull in the long meadow , and ride on the top of the waggons at the harvest home .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 36]: We know all about the house , and the tapestry in the hall , and the funny wooden pictures of the Dutch ancestors , and the long gallery where you used to dance at night .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 6]: Mother loves talking about it .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 25]: She has not much fun in her life now , poor dear , and that makes her think all the more of her youth .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 20]: We envy her , Ruth and Trix and I , because we have a very quiet time at home .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 7]: We are poor , you see .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 12]: You ca n't have much fun if you are poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 24]: `` You think that riches are the one thing needful ; that if you had enough money your happiness would be assured ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 5]: sighed Mollie rapturously . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 8]: _ How _ happy I should be !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 25]: I 've never had enough money for my wants in all my life , so I ca n't even imagine the bliss of it .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 11]: I should not know how to be happy enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 8]: The old man looked at her silently .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 17]: She saw that he was about to speak , but the words were long in coming .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 19]: A cloud had drifted across the sun , and the stretch of park looked suddenly grey and bare .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 10]: Mollie drew her shoulders together with an involuntary shiver .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 40]: Something had suddenly damped her ardour of enthusiasm ; but it was not so much the bleak wind as the sight of the face gazing into her own , with its set lips , and bleached , joyless expression .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 26]: For years to come Mollie could recall that moment , and feel again the chill in her veins with which she listened to his reply .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 62]: `` All my life long , '' said Bernard Farrell slowly , `` all my life everything that I have touched has turned to gold , and everyone I have loved , '' -- he paused , lingering on the word , and again Mollie shivered in sympathetic understanding -- `` everyone whom I have loved has _ died _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 16]: The wind seemed to take up the word , and repeat it in melancholy echo .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 3]: `` Died !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 2]: died !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 3]: died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 10]: wailed the trees , tossing drearily to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 4]: `` Died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 9]: shivered the ripple over the cold grey lake .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 8]: The clouds gathered in a pall overhead .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 6]: `` I 'm sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 11]: gasped Mollie faintly -- `` I 'm so sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 10]: But Mr Farrell stopped her with a hasty gesture .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: `` Please spare me protestations of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 10]: They were the last thing I wished to evoke .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 21]: I merely wished to impress upon you that I am in a unique position for judging the worth of riches .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 11]: -- Is it your pleasure that we continue our journey ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 7]: The afternoon is growing chill . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 19]: Mollie rose in confusion , but she did not reply , nor make any further offer of support .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 13]: There was something in the old man 's voice which forbade familiarities .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 30]: He was no longer merely cross and unamiable ; she had caught a glimpse into the secret of a desolate heart , and the sight sobered her youthful spirits .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 29]: `` First his wife , '' she said to herself , as she led the way onward -- `` pretty Aunt Edna , whom mother loved so much .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 20]: He adored her , and they were never parted for a day till she took typhoid , and died .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 17]: The little girl died the year after , and he had no one left but Ned .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 19]: Mother says he was the handsomest boy she ever met , and the cleverest , and the best .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 29]: Even now , after all these years , she ca n't speak of the day he was drowned without crying ... I always hated to hear that story !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 11]: `` She says the real Uncle Bernard died with Ned .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 18]: He seemed to disappear from that day , and an entirely different person appeared in his place .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 31]: He had been kind and hospitable , fond of having people around him and making them happy ; but after that he shut himself up and became a regular hermit .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 30]: Then he went abroad , and since he came back four years ago and reopened the Court , he has written to nobody , and nobody has seen him .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 14]: But he has come to see us to-day of his own free will .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 4]: I wonder why ?
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 10]: Something has happened to make him break the silence .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 7]: What can it have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 30]: She dared not ask the question ; but , as the feeble steps endeavoured to keep pace with her own , a possible explanation darted into Mollie 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 28]: The poor old man was ill , very ill ; there was an expression on the grey , sunken face which was eloquent even to her inexperience .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 18]: Death was coming forward to meet him , coming very near ; standing upon the very threshold !
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 19]: Strong , happy nineteen shuddered at the thought , and felt an overpowering pity for the waning life .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 59]: Mollie longed to comfort the old man with the assurance that there were many still left who could help and minister to his declining days ; but her previous overtures had met with so little success that she was afraid of meeting yet another rebuff , and , with unusual prudence , decided to await a better opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 20]: Langton Terrace was reached at last , and Mollie produced a key and opened the door of Number 7 .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 57]: In a household where there are so many children and so few servants , the latchkey was in constant use , and thus it happened that she could bring her guest unnoticed into the house and escort him to her stepfather 's sanctum , which was sure to be unoccupied at this hour of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 33]: She drew forward an armchair , poked the fire into a blaze , and laid Mr Farrell 's hat and stick on the table , while he lay wearily against the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 15]: He looked woefully exhausted , and Mollie 's kind heart had a happy inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 22]: `` I sha n't tell anyone that you are here until you have had a rest , '' she said assuringly .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 23]: `` This is the pater 's den , and his private property after four o'clock , so you will be quite undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 15]: Just tell me what will refresh you most -- tea , coffee , wine ?
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 10]: I can bring what you like quite quietly . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 13]: `` Tea , please -- tea , and ten minutes ' rest .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 12]: I shall be better then , '' Mr Farrell said wearily .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 25]: Mollie left the room to prepare a dainty little tray in the pantry , and beg a private pot of tea from the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 47]: The idea of waiting in secret upon Uncle Bernard was delightfully exciting ; it was almost as good as running the blockade , to creep past the dining-room door where her mother and sisters were assembled , and listen to the murmur of voices from within .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 10]: If they knew -- oh , if they knew !
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 47]: She had prepared some crisp slices of toast , skimmed the cream off the milk in defiance of cook 's protests , and made sure that the water in the little covered jug was boiling , and not only moderately warm , as the custom was .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 45]: It was the simplest of meals , but at least everything was as tempting as hands could make it , and Mollie had the satisfaction of pouring out two cups of tea , and seeing the last slice of toast disappear from the rack .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 27]: She took nothing herself , and preserved a discreet silence until Mr Farrell replaced cup and plate on the table , and condescended to smile approval .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 18]: `` Thank you , Miss Mollie ; I am obliged to you for securing me this rest .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 18]: Judging from my first impressions of your character , I should not have expected so much common-sense .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 17]: I feel quite refreshed , and ready to see your mother when it is convenient . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 18]: Mollie lifted the tray , and stood for a moment looking down with an air of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 6]: `` I 'm so glad !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 46]: I talk a lot of nonsense , but I can be quite sensible if I like , and I _ did _ want to help you , Uncle Bernard ; I 'll send mother in here , where you can have your talk in peace .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 10]: It 's the only chance of being uninterrupted . ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 25]: Mr Farrell made no reply , and Mollie made haste to deposit the tray in the pantry , and rush for the dining-room door .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 18]: The secret had been kept so long that she felt sore -- absolutely sore with the strain .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 36]: It seemed incredible that her mother and sisters should be sitting munching bread - and-butter as calmly as if it were an ordinary day , when nothing extraordinary had happened to break the monotonous routine .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 18]: She leant against the lintel of the door and called her mother by name -- `` Muv !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 9]: you are wanted at once in the Den .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 8]: Somebody wants to speak to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 58]: Mrs Connor 's brow furrowed into the usual anxious lines as she prepared to hear a story of fresh disaster from her husband 's lips ; but at the doorway two magic words were whispered into her ear which brought the blood into the white cheeks , and sent her trotting down the hall on eager feet .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 19]: Then came the delicious moment to which Mollie had looked forward ever since the meeting at the cross-roads .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 21]: She walked back into the room , while Ruth looked up with weary curiosity , and Trix with unconcealed wrath .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: `` You might have let mother finish her tea in peace !
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 15]: She has been slaving all day , and was just enjoying a rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 7]: `` What is it , Mollie ?
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 9]: Why did the pater come home so early ?
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: Is he ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 9]: `` It is n't pater , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 3]: Guess again !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 17]: A friend of mine , whom I met in the park and brought home to tea .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 26]: He was rather tired , so I , gave him a private little feed in the study , instead of bringing him straight in here .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: Considerate of me , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 6]: He was quite touched . ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 4]: `` He ? ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 4]: repeated Ruth breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 9]: `` Mollie , what are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 9]: Do n't make a mystery out of nothing !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 12]: Why ca n't you say at once who it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 10]: `` I 'm afraid of your nerves , dear .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 10]: I want to break it to you by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: Sudden shocks are dangerous for the young .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 13]: My own heart is quite palpitating with all I have undergone to-day .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 37]: I was walking along , -- all innocent and unsuspicious , -- gazing upon the fair spring scene , when suddenly , glancing ahead , I beheld a figure standing at the junction of the cross-roads .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: 'T is ever thus , my love !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 21]: Fate stands waiting for us where the paths diverge , to point out the way in which we should go .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 11]: End of volume one ... Do you feel excited ? ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: Trix grinned broadly , Ruth looked tired and impatient .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: `` Oh , thrilled , of course !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 17]: So many interesting people come to see us that it 's difficult to choose between them .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 16]: The piano-tuner , perhaps ; or the gasman , to look at the meter . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 21]: `` I should have walked home with them , should n't I , and given them tea in the study ?
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 11]: A little higher in the social scale , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 9]: `` The curate calling for a subscription ? ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: `` Cold ; quite cold !
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 3]: Try again !
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 24]: Someone you have often wished to see , but who has never displayed any great anxiety to make your acquaintance in return . ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 8]: `` Uncle Bernard , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 39]: said Ruth sarcastically , not for one moment believing the truth of her words , though her mind instantly reverted to the personage of that mythical uncle who had played so large a part in her mental life .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 25]: She did not even trouble to look at Mollie as she spoke ; but Trix did , and bounded to her feet in excitement .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 7]: `` Is it -- is it ?
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 7]: Oh , Mollie , not really !
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: He has n't really and truly appeared after all these years ?
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 7]: You do n't seriously mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: Look at her , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 9]: I believe it _ is _ true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: Ruth looked , and flushed the loveliest of pinks .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 29]: It seemed almost incredible that Trix was right , yet something very much out of the usual course of events must have happened to excite Mollie so keenly .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 20]: Her cheeks were burning as though with a fever , the hand resting on the table was actually trembling .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 7]: `` Tell me , Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 11]: she pleaded ; and Mollie nodded her head in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: `` Uncle Bernard himself !
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 27]: The real , genuine article sitting in solid flesh and blood in our very own study , and I 'm the one who brought him here .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: What do you think of _ that _ for an adventure ?
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 33]: I saw an aged , aged man a-leaning on a stick , as the poem says , and I went up and asked him if I could help him in any way .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 17]: I once read about an old man whose nose suddenly began to bleed in an omnibus .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 47]: He searched for a pocket - handkerchief , but had evidently forgotten to bring one , and the other passengers began to smile and titter , all except one girl , who opened her bag and presented him with a nice clean one of her own .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 19]: The old man died soon afterwards , and left her a million pounds as a token of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 22]: I think it 's just as kind to escort a stranger through a lonely park when he has lost his way !
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 22]: If Uncle Bernard adopts me and gives me a million , I 'll treat you both to a nice new hat .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 23]: -- I asked where he was going , and he said to Number 7 Langton Terrace , and I looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: And , Ruth , do you know what I thought of ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 7]: I thought of _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 42]: He had black eyebrows like yours , and he scowls , as you do -LRB- only when you are cross , dear , not when you 're in a good temper -RRB- , and his lips droop like yours , too .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: I thought , ` I have seen that face before ! '
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 17]: and then I remembered the photographs , and it burst upon me all in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 43]: Then he asked me if I knew the Connors , and I said I 'd known them for years , and the step-daughters , too , and that they were a charming family , but Mollie was the nicest of all . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: `` Mollie , you did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 8]: It 's true , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 19]: When I revealed myself to him , however , he seemed to think that I was rather vain .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 15]: I must leave it to time to prove the truth of my assertion . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 6]: `` You are in earnest ?
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: You really mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: Mollie , what has he come for ?
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 11]: What has made him remember us after all these years ?
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 10]: Has something happened that we know nothing about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 7]: `` I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 32]: There 's only one thing certain , -- he is very old and ill , and if he wants to see us at all there is n't much time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 36]: He is not at all like the Uncle Bernard mother remembers , but very cross and irritable , and his poor old face looks so miserable that it goes to your heart to see him .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 25]: I wanted to put my arms round his neck and kiss him , but I would as soon have attempted to embrace a tiger .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 7]: He snubbed me the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 6]: Oh , talk of adventures !
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 10]: _ What _ an afternoon I have had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 37]: `` If you met him walking across the park he ca n't have any luggage , and if he has n't any luggage he ca n't intend to sleep here to-night , '' reasoned Ruth thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 9]: `` Perhaps he will just stay to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 34]: Pea - soup , cold beef , and apple-pie -- that 's all there is , and he is accustomed to half a dozen courses , and two men-servants to wait upon him .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 18]: Poor dear mother will be in despair because she did n't order a fresh joint for to-day .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 22]: Shall I go to the kitchen and see if there is anything that can be made into a hot dish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 43]: Mollie pursed up her lips , but , before she had time to reply , the sound of footsteps was heard from without , and Mrs Connor appeared in the doorway , followed by the tall , gaunt figure of Uncle Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 30]: The girls rose from their seats as he entered the room , and Ruth and Trix approached him with diffident smiles , while Mrs Connor introduced each by name .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 21]: `` This is my eldest girl , Ruth ; you saw her last when she was a baby in arms .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 21]: This is Beatrice Connor ; she knows you quite well by name , do n't you , Trix dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 25]: But Mr Farrell betrayed not the faintest interest in Trix or her memories , and barely touched the hand which she extended towards him .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 24]: All his attention seemed concentrated on Ruth , as she stood before him with her beautiful , flushed face raised to his own .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 6]: `` This is Ruth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 4]: he repeated slowly .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 10]: `` She is not at all like her sister .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 17]: I am glad that one of your girls takes after her father 's family , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: This one is an unmistakable Farrell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 8]: Mollie turned aside with an expressive grimace .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 12]: `` I 'm cut out already , '' she told herself .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 12]: `` Ruth 's black brows have walked straight into his affections !
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 13]: I might as well resign myself to play second fiddle forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 30]: Mr Farrell accepted an invitation to stay for the family dinner , but it can not truthfully be said that his presence added to the gaiety of the meal .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 40]: Mrs Connor was nervous and ill at ease , regretting , as her daughter had foretold , that she had not ordered a hot joint for to-day , and allowed the cold meat to be used on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 68]: She looked gratefully at Ruth when a small dish of curry made its appearance , in addition to the scanty menu ; but Uncle Bernard had spent some years of his life in India , and his ideas of curry evidently differed from those of the plain cook downstairs , for after the first taste he laid down his fork and made no further pretence of eating .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 25]: Mr Connor made several attempts to introduce interesting subjects of conversation , but receiving only monosyllabic replies , relapsed in his turn into silence .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 65]: With every moment that passed , the girls felt less able to imagine the reason for the appearance of a visitor who showed so little interest in the affairs of the family ; for Mr Farrell asked no questions , paid no attention to the general conversation , and , for the greater part of the time , appeared lost in his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 24]: The three little boys alone were unaffected by the general tension , and chattered about their school adventures in their usual noisy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 52]: On another occasion Mrs Connor would have checked them , but anything was better than the dead silence which at one time had threatened the whole table ; so she left them unreproved , and Uncle Bernard scowled at them beneath his bushy brows in a manner the reverse of approving .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 36]: It happened that Betty occupied the seat immediately opposite the visitor , and it was one of Betty 's idiosyncrasies to repeat the grimaces of others with an imitation as faithful as it was unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 70]: When , for example , Mollie was speaking , Betty tossed her head , tilted her chin , and arched her brows , to the delight and amusement of the family ; and now , there she sat -- good , kind , most inoffensive of creatures -- drawing her wisps of eyebrows together in a lowering scowl , and twisting her lips into an expression of sour distaste .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 34]: The three boys nudged each other and tittered together , and Mr Farrell looked round to discover the reason of their mirth , and beheld Betty 's transformed face peering into his own .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 33]: His glance of indignation made her flush with what appeared to be conscious guilt , though , in truth , the poor child had no idea of the nature of her offence .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 34]: Mrs Connor beheld the incident with petrified horror , Ruth registered a determination to lecture Betty out of so dangerous a habit , but warm - hearted Mollie rushed headlong into the breach .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 12]: `` Uncle Bernard , Betty did not mean to be rude !
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 9]: Please do not think she was intentionally disrespectful .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 54]: She has a habit of imitating people , without knowing what she is about , and I am afraid we laugh at her for it , because it is so funny to watch ; but she would be dreadfully sorry to be rude to anyone , would n't you , Betty dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 12]: Betty 's lips opened to emit a hoarse , inarticulate murmur .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 24]: Uncle Bernard turned his eyes upon Mollie , and said coldly -- `` You wish to imply that she was imitating my expressions ?
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 2]: Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 14]: It is always interesting to know in what light one appears to others .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 11]: I regret that I failed to catch the likeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 13]: `` Dear Uncle Bernard , shall we go to the drawing-room now ?
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 10]: The children use this room to prepare their lessons .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 9]: We will have coffee in the drawing-room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 5]: cried Mrs Connor eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 31]: And the elders filed across the hall , leaving poor Betty reduced to tears of misery , while the boys comforted her by jibes and jeers in true schoolboy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 15]: In the drawing-room a ghastly silence prevailed , broken by fitful efforts of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 41]: Mr Farrell had asked that a cab should be ordered by nine o'clock to take him back to his hotel ; but , though the time drew nearer and nearer , he still vouchsafed no explanation of the unexpected visit .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 31]: Surely -- surely , before going away he would say something , and not once more disappear into the mist , and let the veil of silence fall around him ?
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 35]: The same thought was in every mind , the same wondering anticipation ; but it was only when the cab was announced and Mr Farrell rose to say good-bye that he appeased their curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 15]: `` I came here to-day to make the acquaintance of my nephew 's daughters .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 21]: I should be glad , Mary , if you would allow them to pay me a visit at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 21]: I have arranged to have a lady in residence who will look after them and do what chaperonage is needful .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 17]: If Monday will suit you , I should like them to arrive on that day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 22]: It sounded more like a command than an invitation , but such as it was it thrilled the listeners with joy .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 42]: To pay a visit , and above all , to visit the Court , of which they had heard so much , had been the girls ' day-dream for so long that it seemed impossible that it had come at last .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 33]: Ruth 's mind flew at once to considerations of ways and means , and she suffered a moment of agonising suspense before Mrs Connor 's eager consent put an end to anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 10]: `` Oh , I shall be delighted -- delighted !
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: The girls will love it , of all things .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 9]: How kind of you , dear Uncle Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 2]: Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 2]: Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 13]: Are you not delighted to have such a treat in store ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 14]: `` Thank you , Uncle Bernard ; I should love to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 4]: cried Ruth warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 26]: `` Mollie and I have often said that there is nothing in the world we should enjoy more than paying a visit to the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: It is most good of you to ask us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 27]: `` And we will try to behave very nicely , and not bother you at all , '' added Mollie , her eyes dancing with happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 9]: `` We are to come on Monday week .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 16]: And will there be other people , too -- other visitors , besides ourselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 9]: `` Probably , '' said Uncle Bernard curtly .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 21]: `` There are several important matters to be discussed , into which I can not enter in a short interview .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 19]: I am inviting you -- and others -- in order that we may talk them over at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 10]: A carriage will meet the train arriving at four-twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 6]: Good - afternoon , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 17]: I shall not see you again , as I leave by an early train to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 23]: Even as he spoke , Mr Farrell made his way towards the door with an air of finality which forbade further questioning .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 31]: He had waited until the last possible moment before giving his invitation , and , having obtained an acceptance , was evidently determined to take his departure without further delay .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 43]: Mrs Connor escorted him to the door , her husband helped him into the cab , offered to accompany him to the hotel , was coldly snubbed for his pains , and came back into the house heaving deep sighs of relief .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 7]: `` Now for my smoke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 25]: he exclaimed , and hurried off to the study , while Mrs Connor was dragged into the drawing-room and subjected to a breathless cross-questioning .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 7]: `` Matters of importance to discuss !
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 8]: Mother , what can he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 6]: `` Other people besides ourselves !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 8]: Mother , who can they be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 11]: `` How long does he want us to stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 11]: `` What are we going to do about clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 12]: `` That 's just exactly what I 'm asking myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 15]: cried Mrs Connor , referring with equal truthfulness to all four questions at once .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 43]: `` It is most awkward , not knowing how long you are expected to stay , or what sort of a party you are to meet ; but , in any case , I am afraid you must have some new clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: I will have a talk with pater , and see what can be done , and you must divide my things between you .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 21]: I have a few pieces of good lace still , and one or two trinkets which will come in usefully .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 21]: I am afraid we can not manage anything new for evenings ; you must make the black dresses do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 4]: Mollie groaned dismally .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 8]: `` They are so old and shabby !
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 13]: The sleeves look as if they had come out of the Ark. .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 12]: I do so long to be white and fluffy for once .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 10]: Ca n't we squeeze out white dresses , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 18]: I 'd do without sugar and jam for a year , if you 'll advance the money .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 33]: Even muslin would be better than nothing , and it would wash , and come in for summer best , and then cut up into curtains , and after that into dusters .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 21]: Really , if you look at it in the right light , it would be an economy to buy them !
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 13]: I am sure Uncle Bernard would like to see me in white !
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 9]: Now do n't you think he would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 17]: `` I 'll do what I can , dear -- I 'll do what I can !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 12]: I should like you both to look as well as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 6]: ` Matters of importance ! '
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 20]: ... I ca n't think what matters of importance Uncle Bernard can wish to discuss with children like you .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 7]: And who are the other guests ?
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 9]: And are they also included in the discussion ?
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 38]: I do n't know of any near relations he has left , except ourselves ; but he was even more intimate with his wife 's people than his own , and she belonged to a large family .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 4]: Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 12]: It is most awkward to be so much in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 17]: I do wish he had been a little more explicit while he was about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 14]: `` Never mind , muv ; it makes it all the more exciting .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 37]: We are going to meet someone , and we do n't know whom ; and to discuss something , and we do n't know what ; and to stay , we do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 21]: There 's this comfort -- we can easily take all our belongings , and still not be overburdened with luggage !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 10]: Ten days -- only ten days before we start !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 9]: It sounds almost too good to be true .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: But how will you manage without us , dear little mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: `` Oh , do n't trouble about me , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 5]: I 'll manage beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 48]: Old Miss Carter can come in to help me if I get too tired ; but , indeed , I shall be so happy to think of you two girls staying at the dear old Court that it will do me as much good as a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: Now I will go and talk to pater about money matters .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: We ought to begin preparations at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 62]: Mr Connor joined in the general satisfaction at the invitation which had been given to his step-daughters , and , though mildly surprised to hear that any fresh equipments would be required , took his wife 's word for the need , and produced two five-pound notes from his cash-box , which she was deputed to use as she thought fit .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 55]: `` If you do n't need it all , you can give me back whatever is over , '' said the innocent male , little reckoning that three feminine heads would lie restless on their pillows that night , striving in vain to solve the problem of making ten pounds do duty for fifty .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 33]: Next morning , pencils and paper were in requisition to check mental additions , while Ruth drew up a list of usefuls , and Mollie one of fineries which seemed equally essential .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 18]: At a most modest estimate it seemed possible to purchase the whole for something under thirty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 19]: A painful curtailment brought it down to twenty , but by no persuasion could that sum be halved .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 9]: `` Unless we play Box and Cox ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 6]: cried Mollie , in desperation .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: `` One rain cloak , and an understanding that one of us invariably feels chilly , and stays at home on wet days .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 23]: One white dress , to be worn in turn on special occasions , while the other languishes in bed with a headache .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 6]: One evening cloak , ditto .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 5]: Ditto gloves and sundries .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 14]: It is the only way I can see out of the difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: `` Do n't be absurd , Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 24]: We shall _ both _ have to stay in bed if anything special takes place , for we ca n't afford any extras .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 69]: I remember once asking Eleanor Drummond 's advice about spending my allowance , and she said , ` Wear a shabby dress , if you must ; wear a shabby hat , if you have not taste and ingenuity to trim one for yourself out of next to nothing ; but never , never , never condescend to a shabby petticoat or shoes down at the heel ! '
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 19]: I thought it splendid advice , and have always acted upon it , as far as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 17]: Let us buy really nice boots and slippers and petticoats before we do anything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 22]: `` I 'll have a silk one , then , and rustle for once , if I die for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 4]: cried Mollie recklessly .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 24]: `` And the boots shall be thin , not thick , with a nice , curved sole to show off my patrician instep .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 17]: If I have to content myself with usefuls , they shall be as ornamental as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 34]: Do n't you think we might possibly squeeze out net over-skirts to wear with the black silks , sometimes , so as to make them look like two dresses instead of one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: `` Oh , my dear , I like luxuries as much as you do !
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 10]: It 's only grim necessity which makes me prudent .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 38]: The black net is really an inspiration , and if we make it up ourselves we can manage quite well , and have enough money left for gloves and ribbons , and one fresh blouse a-piece . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: For the next week all was bustle and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 61]: The girls paid two long shopping expeditions to town , and returned laden with interesting parcels , the contents of which were displayed to an admiring audience in the drawing-room , and then taken upstairs to Attica , which was transformed into a dressmaker 's work-room , barriers being for once ignored in consideration of the importance of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 31]: The five-pound notes became wonderfully elastic , and even after they were expended little offerings came in from friends and members of the family to swell the great sum total .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 16]: One sent a pretty tie , another a belt , a third a lace handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 39]: Trix supplied a most stylish collection of pens , pencils , and indiarubbers , reposing in her very best box ; and Betty , not to be outdone , rummaged among her various collections for a suitable offering .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 55]: Eventually she discovered a half - emptied bottle of eau-de-Cologne , which had been presented to her the Christmas before , filled it up with water , and presented it to her sisters for mutual use , unperturbed by the fact that the transparent hue of the scent had changed to a milky white .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 81]: On the morning of the fifth day Ruth had a conviction that she was sickening with a dire disease ; on the sixth , she anticipated a disabling accident ; on the seventh , she waited hourly for a telegram from Uncle Bernard , retracting his invitation ; on the eighth , she wanted to know what would happen if there was a cab strike in the city ; and on the ninth , talked vaguely of blizzards and earthquakes .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 43]: Something it seemed _ must _ happen to prevent this long-dreamed-of journey ; it did not seem possible that the stars should run placidly in their courses , while Ruth and Mollie Farrell were going a-visiting with a box full of fineries !
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 21]: Yet the day did break , an ordinary , grey morning , with no sign to distinguish it from another .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 18]: Looking out of the window , men and women could be seen going calmly about their duties .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 10]: The postman and newspaper-boy arrived at their accustomed time .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 16]: No one outside the household seemed to realise that the day was big with fate .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 40]: At eleven o'clock a cab drove up to the door ; the boxes were piled on the roof ; and the heroines of the hour made their appearance in the doorway , immaculately trim and tidy in travelling array .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 33]: The brothers and sisters were absent at school , so there was only the little mother to say adieu , and stand waving her hand until the cab had disappeared from view .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 31]: Once , she too had been young and fair , and life had stretched before her like an empty page , on which the most marvellous happenings might be enrolled .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 29]: Now , she was old and harassed and poor , and there seemed little ahead but work and worry ; yet she could not call life a failure .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 40]: `` I have had the best thing , '' she said to herself , as she shut the door and re-entered the empty house -- `` plenty of dear ones to love , and to love me in return .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 15]: God bless my two girls , and give them the same sweet gift . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 4]: AT THE COURT .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 29]: The girl whose lot has been cast in narrow places , and whose youth has known few relaxations , should take heart at the thought of the future .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 7]: There is a good time coming !
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 31]: However long be the lane , the turning must eventually be reached ; and then -- ah , then , what zest of delight , what whole-hearted , unqualified enjoyment !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 53]: If Ruth and Mollie Farrell had been in the habit of paying half a dozen visits a year , -- if , indeed , they had even once before started off together on pleasure bent , would they have hailed every incident of the journey with the delight which they experienced to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: Not a bit of it !
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 40]: They would have grumbled at the wait on the platform , at the stoppages of the train at country stations , at the draught from the window , the banging of the door , the constant requests for tickets .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 30]: They would have yawned and lolled back in their corners , and eventually shut their eyes and fallen asleep , regardless of the scenes through which they were passing .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 11]: As it was , every fresh stop was a delight .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 38]: They beamed at the porter who collected their luggage , paid for return tickets with the complacence of millionaires , and thought it lucky that there were ten minutes to spare before the arrival of the train .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 31]: They tried each other 's weight , to the delight of the onlookers ; put a penny in every available slot , and made a reckless expenditure in penny magazines .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 62]: Last , and greatest luxury of all , Ruth actually ordered a tea-basket to be handed into the carriage at a half-way station ; one basket to do duty for two , but still a deliberate extravagance , when refreshments had been provided from home ; and oh , dear me , how delicious it was to be extravagant for once !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 64]: When the train came in , one porter dashed forward to secure window-seats in an empty carriage , another hurried up with rugs and handbags ; groups of people standing upon the platform looked after the two girls with kindly glances ; everybody seemed kind and interested , as though understanding the nature of their expedition , and wishing them good - speed .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 52]: They sat opposite to each other , gazing out of their respective windows , or making an affectation of reading the magazines which lay littered about the seat ; but the end was always the same , their eyes met in irrepressible smiles , and they began to talk once more .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 10]: Real life was so much more interesting than romance !
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 8]: `` I feel so very Lucille-y ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 15]: Mollie declared `` Travelling on pleasure , with a tea-basket coming to meet me !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 12]: It was an inspiration of yours to order it , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 13]: I shall be grateful to you to the end of my life !
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 25]: Let 's talk about what we shall do to-night ... Let 's guess who will be there , and what they will be like .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 6]: The lady chaperon , now !
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 20]: Should you think that the presence of a chaperon implied that there would be young men in the party ?
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 6]: I hope there are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 10]: `` So do I , '' assented Ruth frankly .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 13]: `` But I fancy that they are more likely to be old .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 24]: Some nieces and nephews of Aunt Edna 's , about mother 's age , perhaps -- middle-aged couples , with caps and spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 14]: How will you feel if we are the only young people there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 9]: `` I refuse to imagine anything so ghastly !
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 10]: The couples may have children , may n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 28]: I imagine a charming girl who has no sisters , and who will adopt us as her dearest friends , and ask us to stay with her .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 26]: I rather think she will be dark , and wear eyeglasses , and have a brother who is musical , and has a tenor voice .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 21]: Then there will be another man -- Sir Somebody or other , who has a big estate in the county .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 33]: He will be very superior at first , and take no notice of us , but in the end he will be conquered by our modest charms and become a devoted admirer .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 45]: Perhaps there may be some couples , but they will be young and festive , and the chaperon will be a dear old thing with side-ringlets , who will let us do as we like , and take our part with the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 12]: That sounds about the right thing , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 4]: Ruth smiled happily .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 5]: `` Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 11]: whoever we meet , I am going to enjoy myself .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 12]: A change , a change -- that 's what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 16]: Everything will be different , and there 's a world of refreshment in that alone .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 13]: How thankful I am that Uncle Bernard asked us both , Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 12]: It 's half the fun to talk things over together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 28]: She lay back in her corner , and gazed out of the window once more , smiling dreamily as a whirl of thoughts flew through her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 14]: What would have happened before she travelled once more past these flying landmarks ?
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 17]: What new friendships would be formed -- what experiences undergone -- what matters of importance revealed ?
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 27]: Life seemed all to lie ahead ; yet from time to time her thoughts drifted back unconsciously to Donald Maclure , and lingered on the memory .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 35]: She had not seen him since the eventful afternoon , but Eleanor had conveyed his good wishes for a happy visit , and her manner showed she was in ignorance of what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 23]: Ruth was grateful for a silence which left her friendship untouched , and her thoughts of the doctor were gentle and kindly .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 11]: `` But I could n't -- I could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 6]: she said to herself excusingly .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 10]: `` I do n't want to marry anyone yet .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 16]: I just want to be young and happy , and have a good time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 47]: At the half-way station the tea-basket made its appearance , and the girls sat side by side taking turns at the cup , and nibbling at bread - and-butter and plum-cake like two happy children out for a holiday , which in good truth they were .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 24]: They made a pretty picture , and more than one of the passengers upon the platform cast admiring glances as they passed by .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 49]: So far , the carriage had been empty , except for themselves ; but , just as the train was preparing to leave the junction , a young man turned the handle of the door , threw a bag on the seat , and leapt in after it .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 46]: He was on the point of seating himself in the place which Ruth had just vacated , but , seeing the scattered papers , checked himself , and took possession of the further corner , while the sisters studied him furtively from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 27]: He was tall , he was handsome , he was probably about thirty years of age , and he looked thoroughly bored and out of temper .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 27]: After one casual glance at the pretty sisters , he unfolded a newspaper , and turned from page to page seeking for some item of interest .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 27]: His eyes were blue , he was clean-shaven , his nose was aquiline , and his nostrils were arched , and had a trick of dilation .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 62]: `` Like a high-bred horse , who would n't like the bridle a single bit , '' was Mollie 's comment , as she turned back to the window ; for , after all , the unknown landscape through which the train was now passing was more absorbing than the appearance of a stranger who took so little interest in herself .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 28]: She gazed and whispered , and dreamed afresh , until at last the name of a familiar station gave warning that the journey was nearing its end .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 23]: In another ten minutes the train was due to reach Nosely , and in the interval there was much to be done .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 75]: Ruth solemnly lifted down the aged dressing-bag , which dated from her mother 's youth , and , with a furtive glance at the stranger in the corner , took out a looking-glass and carefully surveyed her hair , pulling it out here , tucking it in there , patting it into position with those deft little touches which come naturally to a girl , but which seem so mysterious to a masculine observer .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 80]: The young man in the corner glanced across the carriage with an expression of lordly amusement at the foibles of a member of the weaker sex ; and there was even worse to come , for when Mollie , in her turn , had arranged her hair , a cloth brush was produced to remove the dust of travel , and two pairs of well-worn dogskin gloves were thrown into the bag , and replaced by others immaculately new .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 29]: Mollie was absolutely without embarrassment in these attentions to her toilet , but it required a little resolution on Ruth 's part to ignore the stranger 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 13]: Only the reflection , `` We will never see him again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 31]: supported her through the critical moments during which she trained a fascinating little curl into position on her temple , conscious meantime of a steady scrutiny from behind the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 86]: It was something of a shock to see the stranger rise from his seat a moment later , and begin making those preparations which showed that he also was approaching his destination ; but , although he alighted at Nosely Station , he had disappeared from sight while the girls were still looking after their luggage , and when they took their seats in the carriage which was waiting to convey them to the Court there was no sign of him on platform or road .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 7]: `` That 's a comfort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 4]: remarked Mollie thankfully .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 13]: `` I am glad he did not see where we were going .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 11]: How superior he looked when we were prinking , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 12]: I do n't like him a bit -- do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't know -- I ca n't think !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: I 'm Berengaria , Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 20]: I never _ was _ a poor girl travelling third-class , and changing her gloves at the last moment !
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 25]: I must have been a duchess in my last incarnation , for I feel so thoroughly at home in an atmosphere of luxury ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 17]: sighed Ruth , leaning back against the cushions , and glancing languidly from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 10]: `` Our luggage is following behind in the cart .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 15]: I hope it will arrive soon , for I want to change my blouse .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 34]: I suppose we shall have tea in the hall with the rest of the house-party , as they do in books , but I hope they wo n't be assembled when we enter .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 24]: I should feel awful walking in , and knowing that they were all staring and criticising our appearance , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: Mollie laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 21]: I 'd criticise , too , and shake hands high up -- like this -- and be pleasant and condescending .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 26]: We are Uncle Bernard 's nearest relations remember , and the guests of honour ... Now , we are beginning to go up the hill !
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 24]: You remember mother said there was a long , winding hill , and at the top to the left stood the lodge gates .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 4]: Do n't talk !
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 11]: I do n't want to miss a single thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 18]: So each girl stared steadily out of her window as the horses slowly mounted the hill path .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 63]: For the first few hundred yards there were hedges on either side , and beyond them a wide , uneven landscape ; then came a little village , grouped round a square `` green , '' with all the picturesque accessories of church , ivy-covered parsonage , thatched roofs , and duck-pond , which travellers look for in a well-conducted English village .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 43]: This passed , there was another climb upwards , a wider view of the valley beneath , and finally a sharp turn to the left , and a long drive leading to the greystone Court , whose beauties photographs had made familiar .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 23]: The butler threw open the door as the carriage stopped , and the travellers thrilled with excitement as they crossed the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 31]: First a square vestibule , then the great hall itself , stretching the whole length of the wing , and turning to the right by the foot of the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 40]: The girls ' eyes turned in a flash to the tapestry on the walls , and the wooden portraits of ancestors ; but besides these historic relics there were many articles belonging to a later and more luxurious age .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 40]: Carved oak tables , laden with books and magazines ; chairs and lounges of every description ; a fireplace brilliant with beaten copper and soft green tiles ; leather screens shielding cosy corners ; cabinets of china and curios .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 19]: It was even more imposing than imagination had painted it ; but -- there was no one there !
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 65]: No Uncle Bernard to speak a word of greeting ; no flutter of silken skirts belonging to nice girls who had no sisters , and were dying to adopt other nice girls without delay ; no scent of cigarettes smoked by interesting young men , who might have sisters or might not , but who would certainly be pleased to welcome Berengaria and Lucille !
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 26]: Ruth had knitted her dark brows , and drawn herself stiffly erect ; Mollie was prepared to smile in benign patronage on less important guests .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 35]: It was a trifle disconcerting to see no one at all but a little , black - robed lady , who came hurriedly forward as they approached the staircase and stammered a nervous greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: `` Miss Farrell !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 3]: Miss Mary !
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: I hope you have had a pleasant journey .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: I am Mrs Wolff .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 11]: Mr Farrell was kind enough to ask me -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 7]: I hope you are not cold .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 14]: Your uncle thought you would like to have tea in your own room .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 10]: It will be brought up to you at once .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 20]: Mr Farrell desired me to say that he wished to see you both in the library at half-past five .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 8]: Shall I take you upstairs at once ?
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 31]: We have given you one room -- a very large one ; but if you prefer to have two separate ones , it can easily be arranged -- yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 42]: The girls protested that they wished to be together , and followed their guide up the broad staircase to a room on the first story , where the curtains were already drawn , and a cosy tea-table spread before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 56]: Mrs Wolff had called it large , and she might truthfully have used a more emphatic word , for what had originally been the best bedroom in the house had been , like the drawing-room beneath , enormously enlarged by the addition of a curved , mullioned window , the entire width of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 21]: `` One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , _ nine _ !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: Nine dear little windows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 16]: counted Mollie rapturously , as the door closed behind the figure of the lady chaperon .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 12]: `` What a view we shall have to-morrow morning , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 26]: Sofas , armchairs , writing-tables , two long mirrors to show the set of our skirts -- this is a room after my own heart !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 14]: I shall have one exactly like it when I marry my duke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 29]: `` But I did n't expect to have tea in it , all the same , '' Ruth objected , as she took off her hat and jacket .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 9]: `` The house feels very quiet and deserted .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 22]: If we had n't uncle 's own word for it , I should think there was no one here except ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 9]: He might have come to meet us himself !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: It seems so cold to leave us to strangers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: `` You will be disappointed , my dear , if you expect warmth from Uncle Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 11]: My short interview taught me so much , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 12]: But he wants to see us at half-past five , Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 19]: I 'll prophesy something -- he is going to talk to us about the ` important matters ' !
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 28]: It would be just like him to explain his position before we have been an hour in the house , so that there can be no misunderstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 9]: I 'm right -- I know I am !
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 11]: We are on the eve of solving the mystery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: Ruth shivered , and drew closer to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 7]: `` Do n't make me nervous .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 19]: It will be bad enough when it comes to the point , without thinking of it beforehand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 30]: And it was all the easier to change the conversation , as at that moment a maid entered with a tea-tray and a plate of hot , buttered scones .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 43]: Tea after a journey is always a most enjoyable meal , and when it was over the girls made as careful a toilet as could be managed with the materials at hand , the heavier luggage not having yet made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 20]: Shortly before half-past five a tap came to the door , and a maid entered with a double request .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 35]: `` I have come to show you the way to the library , miss ; and if you would kindly give me your keys before you go , I will have your boxes unpacked .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 11]: What dresses would you like to wear for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 11]: The horror of that moment was never to be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 38]: Before Ruth 's eyes there arose , as in a vision , the patches on the under-sleeves of her morning blouse , the faded dressing-gown , the darns , and make-shifts and pitiful little contrivances of poverty .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 22]: Her cheeks flamed before the sharp eyes of the abigail , and then flamed again with scorn at her own folly .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 10]: `` It is all neat and clean and tidy .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: I _ wo n't _ be ashamed of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 14]: she told herself angrily , as she turned to search for her keys .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 4]: But the evening-dresses !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 27]: The next moment with a mingling of relief and irritation , she heard Mollie 's unabashed reply -- `` Oh , we have only black dresses !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 10]: We will wear the net over-skirts , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 26]: Just like Mollie , to wear her best clothes on the first possible occasion , instead of prudently storing them up for a special need !
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 17]: But it was too late to protest ; already the maid was leading the way onward .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 7]: The all-important interview was at hand !
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 5]: MR. FARRELL 'S PLAN .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 7]: `` Miss Farrell , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 12]: said the maid , throwing open the door of the library .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 10]: And Ruth walked forward , followed closely by Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 38]: It was a long , narrow room , lined with book-shelves , and the solitary light from a crimson-shaded lamp on the central table gave an air of gloom after the bright illumination of the hall without .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 26]: On a lounge - chair beside the table sat Bernard Farrell , looking more cadaverous than ever , with a velvet-skull-cap over his whitened locks .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 26]: He did not rise as his great-nieces approached , but held out his hand in a greeting which was courteous enough , if somewhat cold .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 7]: I am pleased to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 17]: Excuse me for not having met you earlier , but I am not feeling well to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 14]: I trust you have received every attention since your arrival at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 12]: Mrs Wolff had my instructions to look after your comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 17]: `` Thank you , yes ; we had tea in our room -- a lovely room .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 14]: We are looking forward to enjoying the view from that splendid window ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 13]: `` Ah , yes ; it is very fine in clear weather !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 14]: Please make yourselves at home , and ask for anything that you need .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 12]: The servants are good , but they are unused to visitors .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 11]: Have no hesitation in keeping them up to their duties .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 5]: Will you be seated ?
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 18]: In a few minutes we can , I hope , begin the business of the hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 13]: He waved them towards some chairs which were ranged before his table .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 3]: Four chairs !
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 18]: In the twinkling of an eye the girls had grasped both the number and what it implied .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 22]: Two other guests at least were at present in the house , and equally interested with themselves in the coming discussion .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 37]: Their advent was evidently momentarily expected , for Mr Farrell turned an impatient glance at the clock , and even as he did so the door opened once more and two young men entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 33]: One was tall and dark , with an olive skin , and a curious , veiled look about his eyes , caused by the presence of short but abnormally thick black lashes .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 29]: Viewed in profile the lashes entirely hid the eye , but the effect of the thick black line was , singularly enough , rather attractive than the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 16]: He had a dark moustache , and his chin was square and well - developed .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 6]: His companion was -- well !
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 23]: the girls felt that they might have guessed it before , as one of the awkward things which was bound to happen .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 23]: He was the stranger of the railway carriage , the supercilious personage whom they had flattered themselves they would never see again !
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 34]: Like the two girls , the new-comers had evidently not seen their host before , for they were greeted by him with practically the same phrases ; and then came a general introduction .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 25]: `` I must make you known to your fellow-guests -- Mr Jack Melland , Mr Victor Druce -- Miss Farrell , Miss Mary Farrell .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 12]: Mr Melland and Mr Druce are great-nephews of my late wife .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 14]: Miss Farrell and her sister are my own nephew 's only children . ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 12]: The two young men turned towards the girls with curious glances .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 13]: Over Mr Jack Melland 's face flitted an amused glance of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 22]: His companion 's dark eyes widened with a curious scrutiny ; then the lashes dropped , and hid them from sight .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 37]: Seen thus , with mouth and eyes alike veiled , the face was a mask devoid of expression ; yet Mollie had a conviction that she had surprised something closely approaching disappointment in that fleeting glance .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 27]: Why the sight of Ruth and herself had affected the stranger in so unpleasant a fashion it was difficult to understand ; but the impression remained .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 17]: Her eyes travelled upward to the face of Jack Melland , and marvelled at the contrast .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: `` His face betrays him , in spite of himself .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 15]: His nostrils alone would give him away , '' she told herself , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 18]: `` He is cross , the other inscrutable ; Ruth is frightened , and I am amused .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 25]: We look like four school-children seated in a row , with Uncle Bernard as the teacher ... When is the lesson to begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 27]: At once , apparently ; for Mr Farrell lost no time in preliminaries , but began his explanation as soon as the young men were seated .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 31]: `` I have asked you to meet me here as soon as possible after your arrival , for it is better that we should understand each other from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 34]: You have thought it strange , no doubt , that , after having had no communication with your families for so many years , I should suddenly develop a desire for your company .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 30]: Circumstances have , however , materially altered for me during the last few weeks by the discovery that it is necessary that my affairs should be settled without delay .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 35]: `` I have , as you know , no child left to inherit , and as this place is not entailed , it is entirely in my hands to bequeath as I think fit .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 50]: Until now -- for reasons which you may perhaps understand -- the idea of making a will has been so painful that I have continually postponed the ordeal ; but my doctor , who is also my old friend , has convinced me that I must delay no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 36]: `` I am suffering from an affection of the heart which makes it impossible that I can live longer than a couple of years , and probably the time may be but a few months .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 37]: He has urged me , therefore , to settle business affairs , so that I might spend the remainder of my days undisturbed ; but to decide on a suitable heir is not an easy matter .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 39]: I am , as you may have heard , a very rich man , and I hold strong , and perhaps somewhat unusual , ideas as to the qualifications which are necessary for the owner of great wealth .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 26]: It is not my intention to divide the inheritance in any way , therefore it is the more important to make a right choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 15]: He paused for a moment , and the four young people looked up sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: Victor Druce 's eyes roved quickly from one to the other of his three companions .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 10]: Jack Melland 's lips closed more tightly than before .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 9]: Ruth 's cheeks glowed with a carmine flush .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: She was the nearest relation ; hers was the first claim !
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 17]: Her heart beat with quick , sickening thuds ; only Mollie looked frankly curious and unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 41]: `` As I said before , '' continued Mr Farrell , `` we are , so far , complete strangers to each other ; but I judge you all to hold equal rights to anything which I have to leave .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 36]: Ruth and Mary are my nearest legal relations ; but my wife 's people always ranked with me as my own , and , other things being equal , I should prefer a male heir .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 25]: I make no point of the name ; the Court is not an estate which has descended to me from many generations of ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 22]: My father bought it from the late owner , so there is no real reason why a Farrell should necessarily inherit .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 38]: `` It is from one of your number , then , that I shall adopt my heir ; but , in order to do so , I must have some knowledge of your respective characters and attainments .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 11]: As I said before , I hold somewhat unusual views .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 28]: What the world in general would probably consider the best qualification for the owner of a big estate is , in my eyes , an insuperable objection .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 13]: What I look to find , others might regard as a fault .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 15]: We all have our own ideas , and must act according to our lights .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 27]: I wish then , in the first place , to make your acquaintance but do not be afraid that I shall make the task too unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 24]: `` For the furtherance of my plan , I should wish you to lead as full and interesting a life as may be .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 21]: The Court has been shut up for years , but its doors can now be thrown open for your benefit .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 27]: You are free to come and go , to invite whom you will , and no doubt the neighbourhood will be eager to meet you half-way .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 43]: My own health will not permit me to arrange your amusements ; but I give you the use of my house , carte blanche as regards expenses , and Mrs Wolff to play propriety -- the rest you must arrange for yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 37]: If each in turn took the management of affairs for a few weeks at a time , it would meet my views , as helping me to form the necessary ideas of character and tastes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 32]: There was a simultaneous movement of surprise on the part of the listeners , and one and the same word was repeated by four pairs of lips -- `` Weeks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: Mr Farrell smiled grimly .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: `` You are surprised at the time implied .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 22]: My invitations were intentionally vague , for I had not at the time made up my mind as to various details .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 20]: I have now decided that for the proper development of my scheme three months at least will be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 16]: I therefore invite you to be my guests at the Court during that period . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 21]: Again came the involuntary , simultaneous start of surprise , and Jack Melland cried hastily -- `` It is impossible !
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 21]: I am obliged to you , sir ; but it is quite impossible , so far as I am concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 11]: My business -- '' `` My -- my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 3]: cried Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 22]: `` We could not leave her so long ; she needs our help -- '' Mr Farrell interrupted with upraised hand .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 10]: `` We will defer objections , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 12]: I am prepared to meet and answer them , later on .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 37]: For the present I ask you to think quietly over the prospect which lies before you , and to consider how far such obstacles as you have mentioned should be allowed to stand in the way .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 11]: Surely the object is worth some temporary inconvenience or loss .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 51]: This house , and all that it contains , with various properties bringing in an income of over ten thousand a year , will in due course become the property of one of your number -- of the one who best fulfils a certain condition which I consider essential . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 9]: `` And the condition -- the condition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 4]: queried Mollie eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 17]: Mr Farrell looked at her in silence , while a grim smile passed over his features .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 41]: `` That , '' he said slowly -- `` that , my dear Miss Mary , -- will be discovered , with other things , -- when you hear my will read aloud on the day of my funeral ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 2]: SPECULATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 18]: exclaimed Ruth , sinking back in armchair number one , at the right of the bedroom fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 14]: exclaimed Mollie , sinking back in armchair number two , facing her sister .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 6]: `` Likewise , good sooth !
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 4]: By my halidom !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 2]: Gadzooks !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 12]: Of a surety these are great happenings , fair sis ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 9]: `` Do n't be so tiresome , Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 8]: You make a joke out of everything .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 10]: I want to talk over the position seriously . ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 9]: `` So do I -- just dying to .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 6]: Where shall we begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: `` With the time , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 3]: Three months !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 12]: I never dreamt of more than a fortnight , at most .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 10]: Do you think we can possibly be spared ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 11]: `` I do n't think at all -- I know !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 22]: If it was three years , with such an interest at stake , the poor little mother would jump at it .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 27]: Three months soon pass , and there will be two people less to feed and wait upon , and a room less to keep in order .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 31]: Every little tells when people are as hard up as we are , and with the savings mother will be able to pay Miss Carter to help with the mending .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 9]: It will be good for Trix , too .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 14]: The more you depend upon Trix the more she rises to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 23]: I have a shrewd suspicion that she is going to cut us out , and be the show daughter of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 25]: Mother will be blissfully happy building castles in the air ; Trix will be blissfully happy playing eldest daughter , and bossing the family .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 16]: We shall be blissfully happy not pretending , but actually being , Berengaria and Lucille .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 9]: It 's all quite smooth and easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 11]: Ruth heaved a sigh , half convinced , half reluctant .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 8]: `` That 's what you always say !
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: I see such crowds of objections .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 15]: To begin with , I hate the position ; it 's awkward and humiliating .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 41]: To stay here on approval , studied like specimens in a case ; being on one 's good behaviour , and ` acting pretty ' to try to get a fortune for oneself , away from other people -- bah !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 10]: It makes me hot even to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 7]: I should feel a hypocrite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 13]: `` Do n't be high-flown , dear ; it 's quite unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 24]: You could n't be a hypocrite if you tried ; you are too ridiculously ` proud , ' I suppose you would say .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 5]: I call it quick-tempered !
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 34]: If Uncle Bernard snubs you , you will flare out , fortune or no fortune , and if you feel mopey , mope you will , if he disinherits you the next moment .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 39]: I shall be honest , too , because I 'm too lazy to be anything else ; besides , you know , there is always the pleasing reflection that he may _ prefer _ us to be crotchety !
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 8]: Everything is possible where everything is vague .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 52]: Imagine how maddening it would be if we kept our tempers , and smiled sweetly from morning till night , and in the end he left everything to that cross Mr Melland , because he considered it necessary for the owner of wealth to have a will of his own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 4]: Ruth laughed involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 8]: `` You _ are _ a goose !
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 14]: Not much chance of your being the chosen one , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 22]: Uncle Bernard is not in the mood for appreciating nonsense ; he is too sad and ill , poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 6]: That 's another hateful thing .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 37]: I should love to nurse and coddle him , and read aloud , and be good to him generally ; but if one does , it will seem -- Oh , you know -- you understand !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 7]: It 's a loathsome position ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 11]: `` If I feel affectionate , I shall act affectionate !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 23]: He will probably loathe it , so there 's just as much chance of injuring one 's chance as of bettering it .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 31]: In fact , if we are to get on at all , we had better try to forget the wretched money , and behave as if it did not exist .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 72]: If anyone had told us a month ago that we should be staying in a big house with two quite good-looking young men as fellow-guests , and carte blanche to enjoy ourselves as much as we pleased , we would have thought it too impossibly good to be true ; but now that it has come true , we shall be idiots if we do n't make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 19]: I hope Uncle Bernard keeps to his idea of making us each master of the ceremonies in turn .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 14]: Wo n't I make the money fly when it comes to my turn !
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 22]: Picnics and luncheons by day , dances and theatricals by night -- one giddy whirl of excitement the whole time long .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 36]: I 'll take the old dear at his word , and give no thought to expense , and entertain the whole countryside until the name of Mollie Farrell is immortalised for ever in grateful hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 44]: I have always credited myself with a genius for social life ; now for the first time you will behold me in the halls of the great , and gaze with surprise at your sister reigning as queen over the assembled throngs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: `` In your one black dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 4]: `` Certainly not !
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 8]: I 've thought of that , too .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 15]: Suitable equipments must , of course , be part of the carte blanche . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 13]: `` I am sure nothing was further from Uncle Bernard 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 31]: He looks to me like a man who would never notice clothes , or care what we looked like , so long , of course , as we were respectable .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 10]: He has more important things on his mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 6]: Mollie tossed her saucy head .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 21]: `` If he does n't notice of his own accord , his eyes must be gently , but firmly opened .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 35]: We stay at his special request ; at his special request we entertain and are entertained ; it is only reasonable that he should bear the expense of making our appearance do him credit .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 18]: I 'll tell him so , too , if he does n't see it for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 7]: `` Mollie , you wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 4]: You sha n't !
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 5]: You never could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 5]: `` Could n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 6]: You wait and see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 12]: `` And if you did I would never touch a farthing .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 21]: I warn you , once for all , that it is useless , so far as I am concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 19]: Mollie looked at her sister 's flushed , defiant face , and laughed her happy , light-hearted laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 6]: `` Dear old High-falutin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 7]: We wo n't argue about it .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 18]: Half a dozen invitations will show you the soundness of my position better than a hundred discussions .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 8]: Meantime , I 'm going to dress .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 31]: I have a horrible conviction that that maid will return and offer to do ` your hair , madam , ' so I mean to be beforehand with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 50]: Ruth sat still in her chair , enjoying the unwonted luxury of idling , with no disturbing spasm of conscience to remind her that she ought to be mending or patching , or giving Betty a music lesson , or helping Mary to hang clean curtains in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 30]: It was delightful to nestle back against the cushions and study one by one the dainty appointments of the room , and revel in the unaccustomed sense of space .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 16]: Imagine just for a moment -- imagine possessing such a home of one 's own !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 63]: The house , with its treasures of beautiful and artistic furnishings , which represented the lifelong gatherings of a man renowned for his taste ; the extensive grounds , with gardens and vineries and forests of glass , providing an endless summer of blossom ; the income , that in itself was a fortune , and held such inexhaustible possibilities of good .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 13]: What she could do with it , if it were only hers !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 35]: With one stroke of the pen she would repay the poor old tired pater for all his goodness in the past , and lift the weight of care for the future from his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 35]: She would heap luxuries upon the dear little mother , who was still a child at heart ; so pathetically easy to please that it seemed a sin that she should ever be sad .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 25]: The girls should be sent to finishing schools , and the boys given a thorough training to equip them for their fight in life .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 44]: Mollie , of course , should live at the Court , and share equally in all her possessions ; and they would travel , and help the poor , and be kind to everyone , and never forget the day of small things !
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 6]: or grow arrogant and purse-proud .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 40]: Ruth dreamed on in a passion of longing till Mollie , standing before the dressing-table , with her white arms raised to her head , caught sight of her face in the mirror , and uttered a sharp exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 3]: `` Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 7]: What is it , darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 43]: Ruth started nervously and glanced upwards with guilty eyes , but there was nothing alarming in the aspect of the figure which stood over her , white necked , white armed , with the loosened golden hair falling round the anxious face .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 14]: She caught the outstretched hand , and gripped it tightly between her own .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 9]: `` Oh , Mollie , I want it !
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: I want it _ dreadfully _ !
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 11]: When I think of the possibility I feel half wild .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 11]: If I am disappointed , I believe I shall die !
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 10]: I ca n't be unselfish , even for you .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 7]: I want it for myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 19]: She was on the verge of tears , but Mollie 's matter-of-fact cheeriness had the usual bracing effect .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 13]: She seemed neither shocked nor surprised , but only anxious to soothe .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 12]: `` Of course you do ; so do we all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 4]: she replied easily .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 31]: `` It 's humbug to pretend anything else , only I 'm not going to die , in any case , but live and make myself agreeable to the Chosen .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 26]: If it 's you , I shall sponge on you for life , so do n't imagine you will have all the fun to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 13]: Now get dressed , and do n't think about it any more .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 13]: We must look our best to awe those two superior young men .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 34]: I am convinced that they look upon us as country bumpkins , and it 's most important to put them in their proper position at once , so that we may start fair .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 22]: If you are going to do your hair in skriggles it will take you an age , so do begin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 4]: Ruth rose obediently .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 32]: `` Skriggles '' was an inelegant but descriptive title for her most becoming coiffure , which she had already decided must be adopted for the first eventful evening at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 45]: She set to work at once , and was half-way through her task when the maid appeared , as Mollie had prophesied , paused upon the threshold for one horrified moment , and then hurried forward with an `` Allow me , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 6]: which could not be gainsaid .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 39]: The girls grimaced at one another furtively , but in the end the value of the skilled hands was proved by a dainty finish to hair and toilette which sent them downstairs agreeably conscious of looking their best .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 4]: MR. JACK MELLAND .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 31]: In the drawing-room Mr Farrell and his two nephews were standing with their backs to the fire , in the position affected by mankind in that trying wait before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 31]: Little Mrs Wolff was stiffly perched upon an uncomfortable chair , twisting her mittened fingers together and looking supremely uncomfortable , and there appeared to be no attempt at conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 30]: Everyone looked at the two girls as they crossed the wide room , and once again Mollie surprised that curious gleam of disapproval in Victor Druce 's veiled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 23]: Mr Melland was apparently still on his high horse , a faint flush upon his face , his nostrils curved and dilated .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 42]: As for Uncle Bernard himself , his set face showed no sign of approval or the reverse ; he simply bowed to his nieces , and waved them towards a seat , saying curtly -- `` Our party is not complete .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 18]: I have asked the vicar and his wife to dine with us , and make your acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 10]: They will probably arrive in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 5]: `` Oh yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 4]: said Ruth vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 19]: Even Mollie suffered a moment 's eclipse , during which she sought in vain for an appropriate remark .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 20]: It was too absurd , she told herself , to sit round the room like mutes at a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 20]: What was the use of a lady chaperon if she could not fill up the gaps with harmless inanities ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 15]: She glanced from one stolid face to another , then made a desperate plunge .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 11]: `` What time do the posts go , Uncle Bernard ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 11]: We ought to let mother know of our arrival . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 14]: `` I have already directed a telegram to that effect to be despatched .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 21]: May I suggest that you delay any communication on your own part until we have had a future conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 2]: Checkmate !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: Mollie gave a vague murmur of assent , and cast about for remark number two .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 21]: `` It seems so funny to be here and to see all the things we have heard about so often !
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 11]: I recognise this room quite well from mother 's description .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: There is an alcove behind me , is n't there , with a harp in the corner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 8]: `` The harp was removed years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 15]: I imagine there are a great many alterations since your mother 's last visit .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 16]: The use of the word ` funny ' is somewhat inappropriate , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 9]: I see nothing ludicrous in the position . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 4]: Check number two !
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 11]: Mollie 's wide-eyed perturbation was almost pathetic in its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 31]: She was not accustomed to being snubbed in this public fashion , and , after the first shock , a feeling of resentment brought the colour rushing into her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 7]: `` I meant ` curious . '
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 11]: The two words are often used for each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 4]: `` Mistakenly so .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 14]: Many situations are curious which are not in the least degree amusing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 6]: `` They are indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 6]: was Mollie 's mental comment .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 17]: `` The present , for example ; anything much less festive I fail to imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 37]: Her lips twitched involuntarily as the thought passed through her mind , and , looking up , she met Jack Melland 's eyes fixed full on her , with an answering twinkle in their blue depths .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 30]: For one agonising moment she trembled upon the brink of laughter , when mercifully the door was thrown open to announce the arrival of the vicar and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 42]: Mr Thornton was tall and thin , with a much-lined face full of shrewd kindness and sympathy ; his wife was a pretty , plump little woman , who looked on exceedingly good terms with herself and the world at large .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 8]: `` Thank goodness , they will talk !
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 24]: They look alive , not mere graven images , '' Mollie said to herself thankfully , as the necessary introductions were taking place .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 41]: Then the squire gave his arm to Mrs Thornton , Mr Thornton offered his in turn to Mrs Wolff , and Victor Druce , evidently obeying a previous instruction , paired off with Ruth , leaving Mollie to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 23]: In silence the little company crossed the hall ; in silence they seated themselves round the dinner-table and prepared for the feast .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 16]: Ruth 's grey eyes were brilliant with excitement as she turned from side to side .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 27]: She did not want to talk ; conversation would have been but an interruption at the moment ; she wanted but to look and to think .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 44]: The walls were covered with portraits of ancestors -- Captain Farrell who sailed the seas with Nelson 's fleet ; General Farrell who fought under Wellington ; Lord Edward Farrell , the famous judge ; fresh-faced country squires in quaint , old-world costumes .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 42]: The dim faces looked down from their frames with a curious , haunting likeness running through all ; and at the head of the table sat the last of his race , the grim old man to whom death was coming .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 47]: Ah , it must be hard to look back on so good a race , to realise that no son remained alive to carry on the name , and that one of the strangers now seated round his own table would shortly reign in his place !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 32]: Ruth thrilled with pity ; her beautiful eyes grew soft and dreamy ; and the clergyman , looking at her across the table , could scarcely restrain an exclamation of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 59]: He had understood that Mr Farrell possessed only distant relatives , but this girl was a true chip of the old block ; allowing for difference of age and sex , here was the same face which was repeated again and again upon the walls -- the aquiline features , the melancholy lips , the straight heavy brows .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 50]: Mr Thornton knew that the time had come when his host was to choose his successor at the Court , and , looking from one to the other of the four young people , he personally felt no doubt as to the one on whom the choice would fall .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 37]: Ruth Farrell bore her credentials in her face , and with a thrill , half painful , half amused , he realised how great a factor in his own life this slim young girl might be .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 25]: As lady of the Court and his own patron , she would have it in her power to ensure his comfort or the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 13]: Ah , well , well , it was too early to speculate !
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 16]: The child had a sweet , good face ; no doubt all would be well .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 32]: While Ruth and the vicar were absorbed in their own thoughts , Mrs Wolff was also silent , overcome with the weight of responsibility which pressed heavily on her unaccustomed shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 43]: Little Mrs Thornton prattled of cheery nothings at the other end of the table , and Jack Melland , turning towards his companion , remarked formally -- `` I -- ah -- I think we have met earlier in the day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 10]: `` In the train , you mean ; yes !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 26]: We saw you get out at the station , but you disappeared so quickly that I could not think what had happened to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 4]: `` Nothing mysterious .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: A dogcart had been sent for me .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 22]: I jumped into it with my bag , and was out of sight before you had gathered together your possessions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 13]: `` Ah , yes ; we had boxes in the van . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 17]: Mollie tilted her head to its characteristic angle and smiled at him with wide grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 19]: `` And you watched our toilette across the carriage , little guessing it was for your own benefit .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 25]: We knew that we were to meet other visitors here , but had no idea who they were or how many there might be .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 15]: We imagined walking into the midst of a big house-party ; hence the preparations .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 12]: It was only natural we should want to look nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 3]: `` Perfectly !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 26]: I am glad I was fortunate enough to see the result , since I suppose no one else -- '' Mollie shook her head tragically .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 5]: `` Not a soul !
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 13]: Mrs Wolff met us and sent us straight up to our room .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 47]: If it had not been for you , the new gloves would have been wasted on the desert air ; but now we can console ourselves that our trouble was of some use , after all , since at least half the party had the benefit .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 8]: Were you also despatched straight upstairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 4]: `` I was .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 21]: Afterwards , Druce and I had tea in the billiard-room , and went on to join you in the library .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 18]: It has been a somewhat trying opportunity ; I sympathised with your conversational efforts before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 16]: Mollie 's brows went up at this , and she made a sceptical little grimace .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: `` That is not my idea of sympathy !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 14]: You stood by and watched me flounder without making a effort to help .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 15]: It 's not at all pleasant to be snubbed before a roomful of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 19]: You might easily have remarked that it was a fine day , or that the train was punctual .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 9]: Anything is better than a ghastly silence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 15]: `` But , you see , I had had my innings before you arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 24]: As a matter of fact I had introduced those very subjects , and added some original remarks on the beauty of the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 26]: I fared no better than you , so my fellow-feeling made me sympathise with you , though I had no spirit to try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: Mollie laughed under her breath , the influence of her surroundings instinctively subduing the usual merry trill .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 21]: This Mr Melland was an unexpectedly pleasant companion , now that his former gloom and irritability of manner had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 19]: It was as if a dreaded prospect had been removed , and he was luxuriating in recovered freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 54]: Mollie wondered what the change of circumstances could be ; time , no doubt , would show ; and , when they had reached a greater degree of intimacy , she would tease him about his sudden change of front , and treat him to a pantomimic imitation of his former gloomy frowns .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 26]: The prospect pleased her , and she laughed again , showing the pretty dimples in her cheek , while Jack Melland looked at her inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 6]: `` What 's the joke ?
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 6]: May I hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 10]: `` Oh , nothing -- I was just imagining !
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 22]: All sorts of things fly through one 's head , especially to-day , when we really are in an exciting position .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 22]: At home my sister and I have a very quiet time , and we get most of our excitement in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 9]: We imagine things until they are almost real .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 8]: Do n't you know the feeling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 5]: cried Mr Melland bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 16]: His brows were arched , his nostrils curved with the old look of scornful superiority .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 17]: `` I have no experience of the kind , and I do n't want to have .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 6]: It 's a dangerous habit .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 30]: We have to live among realities , and very commonplace realities , for the most part ; and it unfits one for work to be dreaming of impossibilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 11]: `` No , no , no ; it helps one !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 15]: It is like a tonic which braces one up for the ordinary routine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 23]: `` It is like a sleeping draught -- agreeable for the time , but mischievous and relaxing in its after effects . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 15]: Grey eyes met blue with a flash of defiance , then softened into smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 11]: `` It depends upon disposition , '' said Mollie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 16]: `` We find nothing relaxing about it , but a great deal of innocent amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 54]: When we are out shopping and want something badly and ca n't have it , because it costs five shillings and we only possess half a crown , Ruth says to me , ` Let 's pretend a letter arrived by the afternoon post to say someone had left us a million pounds !
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 9]: What would you do first of all ? '
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 65]: Then we can talk about it for the rest of the walk , and decide what dresses we would have , and where we should live , and the papers we should have in the entertaining room , and the furniture in our bedrooms ; and we choose things out of all the shop-windows as we pass , and decide where they shall go .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 22]: I 've furnished my house so often that I really know the rooms , and love them into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 20]: `` And when you go back into the real house you are discontented and amazed at the contrast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 6]: `` Oh dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 5]: That would be silly .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 22]: I am so refreshed by my visit to the castle that I can laugh over the shabbiness which annoyed me before .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: You do n't think it wrong to read an interesting book ?
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 22]: Very well , then , why is it wrong to indulge in a little fiction on one 's own account ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 20]: `` Wrong is rather a strong word , perhaps , but there is a great difference between the two .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 32]: In reading a book you forget yourself in your interest about others ; in dreams -- excuse me -- you think constantly of yourself , and play the part of hero .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 20]: It is a habit which is inclined to make one consider oneself the most interesting person on earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: `` Well , so you are !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 12]: To yourself , I mean ; you know you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 16]: cried Mollie , with an innocent _ naivete _ which made Mr Melland laugh again .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 62]: It was seldom , indeed , that anyone was honest enough to confess to self - love , and her candour seemed infectious , for , on the verge of contradicting her assertion with regard to himself , a sudden recollection rushed through him of his own thoughts , doubts , conflicts , and final determination of the past twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 19]: Did not every one of these concern himself as a primary , if not an only , motive ?
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 35]: Was he not exercised , first of all , by a sense of his own importance , so that the wishes of a dying man availed nothing against the preservation of his own dignity ?
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 23]: The laugh gave place to a frown as he replied -- `` If it is so it ought certainly to be discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: One ought not deliberately to pamper selfishness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 17]: Mollie 's eyes dropped to her plate , and her lips pouted in an involuntary grimace .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 23]: `` Rather inclined to preach , '' she said to herself naughtily , `` and so intensely practical and matter of fact !
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 12]: I must devote myself to the education of his higher faculties .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 27]: I shall have something to say to you , Mr Jack Melland , the first time that will of yours comes into opposition with my own .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 11]: -- ` One ought not deliberately to pamper selfishness . '
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 4]: -- Delightful sentence !
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 7]: I must not forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 2]: INTRODUCTIONS .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 26]: In the drawing-room , after dinner , Mrs Thornton made herself agreeable to the two girls , and was evidently full of interest and curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 31]: `` Having the Court open again will make a great deal of difference to the village in general , and to ourselves in particular , '' she said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 29]: `` Mr Farrell has been so invalided of late years that we have seen nothing of him , and it is quite an excitement to dine here again .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 22]: Dr Braithey told us whom we were to meet , and that , of course , added greatly to the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: I hope you will like the neighbourhood , and enjoy your visit .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 15]: You must let me help you in any way that is in my power .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 18]: I hope you will , for I love being with young people and making them happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 22]: One glance at the kindly face of the speaker proved the truth of her assertion , and both girls assented gladly .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 62]: A few hours ' acquaintance had proved Mrs Wolff to be a mere figurehead of a chaperon , and Ruth shrewdly suspected that her very weakness had been the attraction in Mr Farrell 's eyes , since , in consequence , she would be less likely to hinder that display of character and self-will which it was his object to study .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 28]: Failing Mrs Wolff , then , it was a comfort to meet this brisk , motherly woman , who might be depended on as a helpful confidante .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 29]: Mollie glanced at the heaped-up fire , and , with a sudden impulse of friendliness , pulled forward an armchair , saying eagerly -- `` Do sit down !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 28]: Let us all sit down and be cosy till the men come ; and will you tell us about the neighbourhood and the people we shall know ?
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 21]: We are to be here for three months , and uncle says we can entertain as much as we like .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 16]: He wants us to entertain , but of course we must know the people first .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 10]: Do you suppose we shall have many callers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 5]: Mrs Thornton laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 11]: `` There 's no doubt about that , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 38]: Everybody who is anybody within a radius of a dozen miles will think of nothing , and speak of nothing , and dream of nothing else but you and your cousins until they have made your acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 36]: We have not much to excite us in the country , and to have the Court open again , with four young people to act as hosts , is a sensation of the first water .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 16]: There will be a stream of callers after you have appeared in church on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 25]: You will have a busy time driving over the country returning their calls , and after these formalities are over the invitations will begin .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 13]: I do n't think you will find any lack of hospitality . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 17]: The girls looked at each other with tragic glances which said `` One black dress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 18]: so plainly to their own understanding that it seemed as if everyone else must interpret the meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 19]: Ruth flushed , and asked hurriedly -- `` Are there many girls like ourselves living pretty near ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 17]: `` Oh dear , yes ; girls are never at a discount in a country place .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 12]: Let me see , now , how shall I describe them !
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 103]: In the village itself there is Dora Braithey , the doctor 's daughter , a very good , useful worker in the parish ; and Lettice Baldwin , who lives with her widowed mother ; and the three Robsons , who are what they call good sportsmen , and go in for games ; and further afield there is Honor Edgecombe of Mount Edgecombe , a charming girl , and very musical ; and Grace and Schilla Trevor ; and the Blounts at the Moat have a London niece , Lady Margot Blount , who pays them a long visit every year .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 12]: She is staying there now , and is sure to call .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 14]: She is very elegant and distinguished-looking , and we all admire her immensely .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 15]: My husband thinks her a model of everything that a girl should be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 65]: Ruth and Mollie , staring fixedly into the fire , were naughtily conscious of a dislike towards the immaculate Margot , who had suddenly loomed on their horizon as a formidable rival in the favour of the neighbourhood , while Mrs Thornton unconsciously proceeded cheerily with her recital -- `` Of course there are many more , but I am mentioning the most attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 41]: We have a few young men , too , and most of the big houses have constant visitors for shooting or fishing , so that you can manage to get partners if you want a little hop now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 22]: And then , as you would suppose , I hope you will find time to take an interest in the parish .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 42]: I do n't ask you to take up any active work , for , of course , as visitors your time will not be your own , but I should like to tell you of our various clubs and enterprises . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 20]: `` I hope you will not only tell us of them , but show them to us as well .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 27]: Uncle Bernard wishes us to do exactly as we choose , so our time is our own , and I should like to do some work .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 16]: I should feel so idle doing nothing but enjoying myself , '' cried Ruth eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 12]: Mrs Thornton 's smile of approval had a somewhat wistful expression .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 48]: As her husband had done before her , she looked at these two young girls , and wondered if the time to come would see one of them acting the role of the squire and patron , and as such holding almost unlimited power over the parish .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 33]: They seemed kindly , natural creatures , who would be well disposed towards the vicar and his family ; and a woman had more understanding of little things than any mere man .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 46]: In the flash of an eye Mrs Thornton 's mind reviewed the damp patch on her drawing-room wall , the ill-fitting windows which let in a constant draught ; the hopeless ruin of the tiny conservatory , wherein she reared her precious `` bedding-outs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 72]: She could not but remember that other squires not only kept their vicar 's house in order , but assisted in sending sons to college , daughters to finishing schools , and expressed their interest in the family in a hundred helpful ways ; but Mr Farrell had seemed unconscious of the very existence of her precious olive branches , and had never gone beyond the bare duties of his position .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 60]: Mrs Thornton was no vulgar schemer for her own benefit , but just a mother of a large family , struggling to make the most of a small income ; and a quick repentance for the selfishness of her dreams prompted the desire to help these two young things who were suddenly called upon to fill a difficult position .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 17]: `` Remember , I am always to be found at home or somewhere about the village .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 23]: You will soon get to know my haunts , so that you can run me to earth if you need my services .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 36]: Just come in and out as you like ; the oftener you come the better I shall be pleased , for I am so anxious to help you , if you will allow me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 7]: `` We will , we will !
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 16]: it is lovely of you to offer ; and do please help us now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 26]: cried Mollie eagerly , as the sound of an opening door was heard in the distance , and footsteps crossed the hall towards the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 8]: `` Talk , talk ; do talk !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 29]: I tried before dinner , and got snubbed for my pains ; and we are such strangers that it is difficult to know what to say next . ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 4]: Mrs Thornton laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 13]: `` I 'll do what I can , '' she promised good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 12]: `` Someone may suggest to Mr Farrell a game of whist .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 35]: He used to be a crack player , so I do n't think he can resist the temptation , and that would leave you young folks free to make each other 's acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 16]: As she spoke the gentlemen entered the room and approached the group by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 29]: Judging from their appearance , the last half-hour had not been particularly lively , for the vicar looked tired and worried , and the young men unmistakably bored .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 50]: Mr Farrell 's set face showed few changes of expression , but a faint gleam of pleasure manifested itself at the mention of his favourite game , and presently the four elders of the party were occupied , while the younger members stood together in a somewhat embarrassed silence .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 50]: Left entirely to their own resources , no one knew what to say or what to do ; each girl looked first at her partner of the dinner-table , and then shyly across at the other stranger who was to be a daily companion during the next three months .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 52]: Ruth met no answering glance , for Jack Melland was frowningly regarding the carpet ; but for the first time Mollie had a direct view of the eyes which were habitually hidden behind Victor Druce 's thick eyelashes , and was surprised to find how bright and friendly was their expression .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 8]: `` Shall we investigate the conservatory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 12]: he said at once , as if answering an unspoken appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 14]: `` They wo n't want us to stay here and interrupt the game .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 10]: I think we had better make a move . ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 5]: `` But may we ?
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 7]: Would Uncle Bernard like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 4]: `` May we !
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 13]: Are we not told to amuse ourselves in any way we choose ?
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 23]: Of course we may , '' he replied laughingly , leading the way forward , while the others followed , nothing loth .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 27]: The conservatory opened out of the drawing-room by means of a long glass door , which , being shut , made it into a separate room .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 40]: A room it was , rather than the ordinary glass passage , for it had a wide , open floor , broken only by spreading palms standing in wooden boxes , and in the midst an old-fashioned pink camellia-tree .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 19]: Stands of flowers encircled three sides , and a lamp stood out from the walls in a bracket .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 15]: Given a few rugs and accessories , it would have made an ideal lounge .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 27]: As it was , there was no provision for visitors , and it was evident that no one but the gardener took the trouble to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 35]: Mr Druce looked round rapidly , spied a wooden box under one stand , a stool under another , and brought them forward one after another , flicking off the dust with his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 9]: `` You must have something to sit on .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 15]: Can you manage with these , or shall I bring chairs from the drawing-room ?
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 15]: I do n't want to make a noise if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: `` No , no ; please do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 5]: These will do perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 10]: But what will you do , and Mr Melland ?
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 9]: You must not stand all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 9]: `` Oh , do n't trouble about us !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 29]: We can look after ourselves , '' responded Jack Melland , pushing the flower-pots nearer together on the staging , and lightly swinging himself into the vacant space .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 13]: Victor followed his example , and thrust his hands into his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 33]: For the next few minutes silence reigned while the young men took in and quite obviously admired the charming picture made by the two girlish figures against the background of flowering plants .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 31]: Ruth 's stool had been placed against the camellia-tree , and the pink blooms matched the soft flush in her cheeks , and relieved the sombreness of her black attire .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 22]: Thus placed she looked charmingly pretty , and held herself with an air of dignity , which was a new accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 15]: Ruth was an adaptive creature , tremendously influenced by the surroundings of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 25]: At home her little head was wont to droop with despondency , and the consciousness that she was poor and unknown and shabbily dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 36]: At the Court she was intensely , delightfully assured of being Miss Farrell -- of possessing the family features , and of being , so far , the recipient of her uncle 's greatest favour .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 19]: And so Ruth now leant back with an air of languid elegance , smiling sweetly at her companions .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 13]: Mollie 's bright head peeped from beneath the shadow of a palm .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 34]: She held in her hand a spray of heliotrope , which she had picked in passing , and from time to time bent to smell the fragrance , with little murmurs of delight .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 32]: But Mollie was obviously longing to say something , and when the time came that she met Jack Melland 's eye she suddenly plucked up courage to put it into words .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 13]: `` Do n't you think we ought to introduce ourselves properly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 4]: she cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 24]: `` We have been told each other 's names , and talked politely at dinner , but that 's not really being introduced .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 17]: We ought to know something about each other , if we are to be companions here .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 22]: I do n't know if you two know each other ; but we did not know of your existence until to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 61]: My mother used to stay at the Court when she was a bride , and she loved Aunt Edna , and has often talked to us about her ; but she knew very little of her relations , and for the last twenty years or more she has never seen Uncle Bernard until he suddenly descended upon us last week .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 10]: `` We live in the North -- in Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 20]: People in the South seem to think it is a dreadful place ; but it is n't at all .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 26]: The river is splendid , and out in the suburbs , where we live , it 's very pretty , near a beautiful big park .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 7]: The people are nice , too .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 17]: We are rather conceited about ourselves in comparison with the people in the towns round about .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 24]: You have heard the saying , ` Manchester man , Liverpool gentleman , ' and we are proud of our county , too .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 11]: ` What Lancashire thinks to-day , England thinks to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 35]: I really must boast a little bit , because South - country people are so proud and superior , and seem to think that no one but themselves knows how to speak or behave .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 22]: Someone said to me once , ` You live in Liverpool , then why have n't you a Lancashire accent ? '
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 5]: I was so cross .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 28]: What should she have thought of me if I had said , ` You live in London , why do n't you speak like a Cockney ? '
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 20]: We are not at all ashamed , but very proud indeed , of coming from the North-countree . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 47]: ` Oh , the oak and the ash , And the bonnie ivy tree , ' '' chanted Victor , in a pleasant baritone voice , at the sound of which Mollie flushed with delight , and cried eagerly -- `` Ah , you are musical !
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 4]: That 's nice .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 16]: We must have some grand singing matches , but you must n't sing that ballad .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 7]: It 's Ruth 's special property .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 8]: She sings it with such feeling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 18]: ` And the lad that marries me , Must carry me home to my North-coun-tree ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 4]: `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 37]: Ruth 's tone was eloquent of reproof , but Mollie only laughed , and said easily -- `` Oh well , of course , if you inherit the Court you will have to change your plans .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 26]: I wish I could lift it up bodily and put it down among the dear Westmorland mountains ; but I 'm afraid that 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 10]: I think that is all the history we have .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 12]: No two girls could possibly have led a less eventful life .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 50]: We have had no money to travel and see the world , and we are not in the least bit accomplished , but we have had a happy time all the same , and we mean to be happy , whatever happens ; do n't we , Ruth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 16]: Ruth did not answer , but sat with downcast eyes , staring at the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 34]: She more than half disapproved of Mollie 's candour , despising herself the while for so doing , so she preserved a dead silence , until Jack Melland nobly stepped into the breach .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 17]: `` Well , if you are North-country , Miss Mollie , I suppose I am Colonial .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 14]: I was born in India , where my father 's regiment was stationed .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 23]: He died when I was a youngster , and my poor little mother had a hard struggle to keep herself and me .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 50]: If a fortune had come to us in those days it would have been a godsend , and she would probably be with me now ; but she died eight years ago , and I am alone in the world , with no one to think of but myself .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 23]: I have dingy diggings and a garrulous landlady , but , like you , I manage to have a very good time .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 14]: I am interested in my work -- I 'm interested in life generally .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 14]: I mean to make something out of it before I am done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 12]: He threw back his head with a proud , self-confident gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 19]: Young , strong , high-spirited , he felt at that moment that the world lay at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 20]: All things seemed possible to his unaided powers , and the thought of help was repugnant rather than welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 28]: The two girls looked at him with the involuntary admiration which women pay to a strong man , while Victor Druce smiled his slow , inscrutable smile .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 16]: `` A good thing for you that you are not in my profession , Melland !
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 15]: A barrister ca n't push ; he must sit still and wait his turn .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 21]: I have been waiting a long time , and I ca n't say that I seem much nearer the Woolsack .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 28]: Still , one can amuse oneself in London , and I have my home in the country to which I can retire whenever I need a rest .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 13]: My old parents are alive , and one sister -- an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 20]: Altogether , I have nothing to complain of in the past , and the future looks pleasant just now .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 12]: Three months in this charming place -- in such society ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 34]: Victor Druce made a graceful little bow , which took in both the girls , and his glance lingered on Mollie bending forward , the spray of heliotrope still raised to her face .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 7]: `` Stealing already , Miss Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 9]: You will get into trouble with the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 18]: How do you know that plant was not being specially preserved for exhibition at a show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 30]: `` I hope it was n't ; but it 's no use telling me to do as I like , and then to object if I pick a flower .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 12]: I shall pick them every day -- several times a day .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 7]: I shall always be picking them !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 23]: I think I shall take the care of this house altogether , and do the watering and snip off the dead leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 4]: I love snipping !
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 21]: And I shall arrange the flowers on the table , too ; they are very badly done -- so stiff .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 8]: Just like a man 's taste ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 22]: The two men smiled at each other , while Ruth protested quickly -- `` No , you ca n't , Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 14]: I 'm the eldest , and I 've ` barleyed ' it already .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 14]: You can arrange the vases in the drawing-room , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 7]: `` Thank you , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 4]: said Mollie calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 7]: `` Just as you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 37]: Judging from the fervour with which she had stated her intentions a moment earlier , the listeners expected that she would dispute her sister 's mandate and hardly knew how to account for her unruffled composure .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 34]: But , in truth , Mollie was already reflecting that flowers took a long time to arrange satisfactorily , and that it would be a bore to saddle herself with a regular duty .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 14]: Much more fun to let Ruth do it , and criticise the results !
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 22]: She sniffed daintily at the heliotrope , turning her head from side to side to examine the possibilities of the conservatory .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 13]: `` Well , anyway , I shall take this place in hand !
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 40]: It will make a lovely little snuggery , with rugs on the floor and basket-chairs everywhere about , and an odd table or two to hold books and work , and tea when we like to have it here .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 26]: I 'll have a blind to the door , too , so that we sha n't be surprised if visitors are shown into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 11]: Is there a door of escape , by the way ?
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 19]: I hate to be penned up where I ca n't run away to a place of safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 29]: She peered inquiringly round the trunk of the palm , whereupon Victor Druce slid down from his perch , and walked to the further end of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 9]: `` Yes , there 's a door here .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 23]: If you see anyone coming for whom you have a special aversion you can get out , and hide in the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 6]: I promise not to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 7]: Perhaps I may come with you .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 9]: I am not fond of afternoon calls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 16]: `` Do n't encourage her , please , Mr Druce , '' said Ruth quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 39]: `` Mollie talks a lot of nonsense which she does n't mean ; but if people are kind enough to come here to see us , she must not be so rude as to refuse to see them .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 18]: I am sure Uncle Bernard would be very angry if we did not receive them properly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 14]: But Mollie was obstinate this time , and refused to be put down .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 4]: she asked rebelliously .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 15]: `` He might be very pleased with me for sharing his own retiring tastes !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 15]: He said himself that he approved of what other people would consider a fault .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 5]: Perhaps he likes unsociability .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 12]: There 's as much chance of that as anything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 53]: Victor Druce came back from his tour of investigation , but instead of taking his former seat , leant up against the stem of a huge palm-tree , whose topmost leaves touched the glass roof , folded his arms and looked down at the two girls with an intent , curious scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 30]: `` It 's an odd position , '' he said slowly , `` a very odd position for us all to be plunged in at a moment 's notice !
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 23]: None of us have any knowledge of Mr Farrell 's tastes , so any attempts to please him must be entirely experimental .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 28]: If we please him we may thank our good fortune ; if we offend , we can , at least , feel innocent of any bad intentions .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 31]: It 's rather a disagreeable position , but I expect the poor old fellow shirks being left to himself any longer , though he would die rather than acknowledge it .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 12]: It 's dull work being left alone when one is ill .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 24]: Personally , it is extremely inconvenient for me to be away from home for three months , but I shall manage it somehow .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 39]: One ca n't refuse a request from a man in his condition , and it would be a pleasure to cheer the poor old fellow a bit , even at the cost of one 's own comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 12]: There was silence for a moment after he had ceased speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 16]: Jack Melland stared at the ground , and swung his feet gently to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 13]: Ruth knitted her black brows , and Mollie looked puzzled and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 6]: It was a kind speech .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 17]: She would have liked to admire it thoroughly , but -- did it ring quite true ?
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: Was there not something unnatural in the avoidance of any reference by the speaker to his own possible gain ?
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 21]: `` I 'm afraid I did n't think much of Uncle Bernard ; I was too busy thinking of myself .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: I want to have a good time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 4]: she said bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 41]: `` It 's a lovely , lovely house , and the grounds are lovely , and the spring flowers are coming up , and we can live out of doors , and be as happy as the day is long .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 16]: I am not going to worry my head about the money , or anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 48]: I 'll be nice to Uncle Bernard in my own way , as nice as he will let me ; but he said that we could enjoy ourselves , and I am going to take him at his word , and do every single thing I like .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 33]: It 's an opportunity which may never occur again , as the shop people say in their circulars , and it would be foolish not to make the most of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 7]: `` I want the money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 4]: said Ruth clearly .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: The pretty flush had faded from her cheeks , and she looked suddenly wan and white .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 11]: The hands which were resting on her knee trembled visibly .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 29]: She had evidently strung herself up to what she considered a necessary confession , and her eyes turned to one after another of her companions in wistful apology .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 6]: `` I want it dreadfully !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 33]: I have been poor all my life , and have longed to be rich , and I would rather live here , in this house , than anywhere else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 22]: If we are going to live together and be friends we ought to be honest with each other from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 9]: It 's selfish , but it 's true !
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 21]: I want the money , and I mean to do every single thing in my power to get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 7]: cried a man 's voice suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 34]: Mollie was frowning and biting her lips in obvious discomfort ; Victor Druce 's drooping lids once more hid his eyes from sight as he stood with folded arms leaning against the palm .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 21]: It was Jack Melland who had spoken -- Jack Melland , roused for once to display unqualified approval and enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 32]: He bent forward on his seat , hands in his pockets , his tall , lithe figure swaying gently to and fro as he faced Ruth with his bright blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 6]: `` Bravo , Miss Farrell !
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 11]: I admire your honesty , and wish you good luck .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 23]: You are perfectly justified in doing all you can to gain your point , and I sincerely hope you may be successful .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 32]: It is only right that a Farrell should inherit the Court , and if you were the old man 's grand-daughter , you could not possibly be more like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: Ruth flushed , but did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 13]: Victor Druce 's measured voice cut like a sword across the silence .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 7]: `` You are unselfish , Melland !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 18]: Are you quite sure that you share the honesty which you admire so much in Miss Farrell ?
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 10]: Have you forgotten how the question affects yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 13]: Jack Melland jumped lightly to the ground and straightened his long back .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 10]: `` Unselfish or not , it 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 9]: The question does not affect me at all .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: I am not going to stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 4]: AN EARLY DECISION .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 38]: `` I am not going to stay , '' said Jack Melland ; and whatever his faults might be , he looked and spoke like a man who knew his own mind , and would abide thereby .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 24]: His three companions stared at him in silence , and one of the three at least felt a distinct sinking of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 31]: `` I was beginning to like him ; we got on quite famously at dinner , and I thought we were going to have ever such a good time together .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 26]: Now we shall be a wretched uncomfortable three , and Mr Druce will like Ruth best , and I shall be out in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 3]: How horrid !
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 5]: How perfectly horrid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 5]: grumbled Mollie to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 36]: Just because she was so perturbed , however , she would not allow herself to speak , but put on an elaborate display of indifference , while Victor asked curiously -- `` You mean that ?
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 7]: May one ask your reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 31]: I never looked upon myself as having the slightest claim upon Mr Farrell , and I do n't care to ruin my business prospects for the sake of an off-chance .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 45]: Besides , the whole position is unpleasant ; I object to being kept ` on approval , ' with the consciousness that if I allow myself to be ordinarily agreeable I shall at once be credited with sponging for the old man 's favour .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 15]: I am quite satisfied with my own lot , without any outside assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 11]: `` Do n't you care about money , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 4]: asked Ruth timidly .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 13]: Jack Melland threw back his head with an air of masterful complacency .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 7]: `` I care about making money .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 38]: That is to say , I love my work , and wish it to be successful , but I am keen on it more for the sake of the interest and occupation than for what it brings .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 24]: A few hundreds a year supply all that I want , and I should not care to be burdened with a big fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 41]: If you come into this place , Miss Farrell , I shall be grateful to you if you will ask me down for a few days ' shooting in the autumn , but I shall never envy you your responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 34]: To kick my heels here in idleness for three solid months , and know that the business was suffering for want of my presence -- nothing would induce me to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 14]: But at this Mollie found her tongue , indignation spurring her to speech .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: `` You are not very polite to the rest of us !
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 32]: I should not have thought it would be such a great hardship to stay in a lovely big house with three young companions , when summer was coming on , too !
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 31]: I should think there are one or two people in the world who would like it even a little better than poking in a stuffy office from morning until night .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 8]: But there 's no accounting for tastes .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 31]: When you are grilling with heat in the City you can think of us sitting under the trees eating strawberries , and thank Fate you are so much better off .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 8]: We promise not to send you any .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 11]: It might remind you too painfully of the country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 4]: `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 15]: cried Ruth in sharp reproof ; but Jack laughed with good - natured amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 10]: `` Oh , I deserve it , Miss Farrell !
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 6]: My remarks sounded horribly discourteous .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 44]: I assure you if I had the time to spare I should thoroughly enjoy staying on for a time under the present conditions ; but as it is quite impossible to remain for three months , I might as well depart at once .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 16]: I do n't suppose Mr Farrell will wish to keep me under the circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 53]: It appeared , however , Jack Melland was wrong in his surmise , for when he announced his decision to his host before bidding him good-night , the old man looked at him coldly and replied -- `` I thought I had explained that we would discuss objections at a later date .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 24]: May I ask what limit you had mentally fixed to your visit when you did me the honour of accepting my invitation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: `` I hardly know -- this is Monday .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 17]: I thought , perhaps until Saturday , or , at the longest , a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 8]: Mr Farrell waved his hand in dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 11]: `` We will leave it for a week , then .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 15]: On Monday morning next I will discuss the position as fully as you wish .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 19]: Now , if either of you young gentlemen cares to smoke , the billiard-room is at your service .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 7]: Please ring for anything you require .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 20]: Meantime , as it is past my usual hour for retiring , I wish you a very good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: `` Checkmate , old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 19]: cried Victor Druce , as the door closed behind the stooping figure ; but Jack deigned no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 18]: The cloud had returned to his forehead , his nostrils were curved with annoyance and thwarted self-will .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 39]: The cloud was still there when he came down to breakfast next morning , and did not lighten even at the sight of the well-appointed breakfast - table , and the two pretty girls who were seated thereat .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 11]: Some meals may be more attractive abroad than at home .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 65]: A French dinner , for example , has certain points above an English dinner ; but we give way to none as regards our breakfast -- that most delightful of meals to the strong and healthy , especially in springtime , when the sunshine pours in at the open window , and the scent of flowers mingles with the aroma of freshly made coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 18]: The breakfast-table of the Court had all the attractions which one instinctively associates with old country houses .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 52]: The massive , old - fashioned silver , the revolving stand in the centre , the plentiful display of covered dishes to supplement the cold viands on the sideboard ; and , as Mr Farrell invariably remained in his own room until lunch-time , the restraint of his presence was removed .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 39]: Little Mrs Wolff busied herself with the duties behind the urn , and Ruth and Mollie in serge skirts and spick and span white blouses looked as fresh as paint , and a great many times as pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 34]: They were laughing and chatting with Victor Druce , who had donned Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers , and was quite the country gentleman both in appearance and in his manner of leisurely good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 48]: The entrance of Jack in what are technically called `` Store clothes , '' with a gloomy frown upon his forehead , seemed to strike a jarring note in this cheerful scene , and both girls were conscious of a distinct feeling of grievance against the offender .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 18]: Was it so dreadful a fate to be doomed to spend a whole week in their society ?
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 56]: Need a man look as if his last hope in life were extinguished because Fate kept him away from the City for seven days , and placed him instead in the sweet green country , with three companions of his own age who -- to put it mildly -- were not perfect ogres in appearance !
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 6]: The necessary greetings were observed .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 25]: Jack helped himself to a bowl of porridge , and , looking up , asked discontentedly -- `` Has n't the newspaper arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 49]: `` Not yet , sir ; it will be here by ten o'clock , sir , '' the butler replied ; and Mollie pulled down her lip with an expression of solemn propriety , and added -- `` But perhaps I can relieve your anxiety in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 18]: Cotton is down twenty points , very strong and steady , and the Bears are making fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 22]: ` Mauds ' are fluctuating , but ` Louisa Christinas ' are in great demand ; everybody is rushing after them .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 18]: The Bank rate is ten and a half , and Consols have gone up two per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 11]: General market firm , with a tendency to drop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 12]: `` My good child , what nonsense are you talking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 32]: cried Ruth aghast , and the two young men exchanged glances and burst into a laugh ; even Jack laughed , though such a feat had seemed impossible a moment before .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 6]: `` What a thrilling report !
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 8]: You make me more impatient than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 56]: It is just like my luck to be out of the way when there is a chance of a good thing , though , after all , I do n't know if the wisest plan would not be to sell everything one had , and put the money in the bank -- eh , Druce ?
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 7]: Ten and a half per cent !
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 11]: Where do you get your knowledge , Miss Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 20]: `` Oh , I see things in the newspapers , and I hear the pater talking to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 20]: Do n't call me ` Miss Mary ' please , it sounds far too quiet and proper for me .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 25]: I am never called anything but Mollie , except when I overspend my allowance , and mother feels it her duty to scold me .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 10]: Are you on the Stock Exchange , Mr Melland ?
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 13]: What sort of business is it which you find so attractive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 16]: `` I am afraid you would not be much wiser if I tried to explain .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 22]: We are what is called ` brokers ' ; but there are an endless variety of businesses under the same name .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 18]: I have nothing , however , to do with ` Mauds ' and ` Christinas ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 52]: `` Neither have I , '' volunteered Victor smilingly , `` To tell the truth , I have no money to invest , Briefs do n't come my way , and I am at present occupied listening to more fortunate fellows , and thinking how much better I could plead myself .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 22]: It palls at times , but I am fond of the profession , and have no wish to change it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Mollie reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 9]: `` The wigs _ are _ becoming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 34]: and when the two young men leant back in their chairs and roared with laughter , she blushed and pouted , and looked so pretty that it did one good to see her .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 66]: The three earlier comers had finished their meal by this time , but they sat still until Jack had disposed of the toast and marmalade which makes the last breakfast course of every self-respecting Briton ; then they rose one after the other , strolled over to the open window , and faced the question of the day -- `` What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 22]: It was Ruth who spoke , and at the sound of her words the shadow came back to Jack 's brow .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 8]: `` Yes , what shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 24]: Think of it -- three months -- twelve weeks -- eighty-four separate days to lounge away with the same question on your lips !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 11]: I 'd rather be sentenced to hard labour at once .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 8]: Life is not worth living without work .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 19]: I 'd rather be a clerk on sixty pounds a year than stagnate as a country squire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 14]: `` You would be a very bad squire if you did stagnate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 23]: cried Mollie spiritedly , throwing back her little head , and looking up at him with a flash of the grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 76]: `` You would have your tenants to look after , and your property to keep in order , and the whole village looking to you to lead every scheme of pleasure or improvement , and the vicar looking to you to be his right hand , and all the growing boys looking to you to help them to a start in life , and the old people expecting you to make their last days easy .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 40]: You would be the hardest-worked man in the country if you did half the work that was waiting for you , and it would be unselfish work , too -- thinking of others , and not of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 10]: Jack looked at her , and his face softened .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 10]: `` That 's true , '' he said frankly .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 9]: You are right , and I am wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 18]: I 'm in a bad temper , and ca n't see things in their right light to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 33]: Of course , if one really settled down to it , there would be plenty to do ; it 's when one is only playing with the position that time drags . ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 14]: `` Well , it ought not to drag to-day , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 25]: We must be very dull if we can not amuse ourselves in surveying the domain , and seeing all there is to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 27]: I am going to put on my hat this minute and examine the gardens , and go down to the stables to look at the horses .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 45]: If anyone likes to come too , they may , but my plans are fixed , '' cried Mollie , nodding her saucy head ; and at the magic word `` stables , '' a ray of interest lit up the two masculine faces .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 42]: Ten minutes later the four young people were strolling down the drive , the girls with serge coats over their white blouses , and sailor-hats on their heads , the men wearing their cloth caps with an evident air of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 23]: They turned the corner of the house , and coming round to the south side uttered simultaneous exclamations of surprise and delight .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 49]: Along the entire length of the house ran an enormously wide terrace edged with a balustrade , from the centre of which a flight of marble steps led to an Italian garden , its green sward and stiffly outlined flower-beds flanked by a quantity of curiously cut shrubs .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 52]: Beyond this garden the ground dipped sharply , showing first a glade of trees whose fresh spring foliage contrasted with the dark colours of the evergreens ; then came a glimpse of a lake , a sweep of park ; and beyond all a glorious , wide-stretching view over the countryside .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 53]: Perched upon one of the highest sites for miles around , this terraced walk afforded such a panorama of beauty as is rarely to be found even in our well - favoured isles , and withal the beauty was of that peaceful , home-like nature which irresistibly endears itself to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 32]: The four young people stood in silence gazing from side to side , and into each mind , even that of the rebellious Jack himself , there crept the same thought .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 15]: This was indeed a goodly heritage , whose owner would be an enviable person !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 23]: The possibility of possessing it as a home was worth a far greater sacrifice than anything which had been demanded of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 17]: In those few minutes of silence dreams ran riot , and finally found vent in words .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 37]: `` When the Court belongs to me I shall have an awning put up on this terrace and sit here all day long , '' said Mollie ; as usual the first to break the silence .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 20]: `` I shall have a table brought out , and breakfast here every fine morning , '' said Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 9]: `` I 'll smoke here after dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 3]: said Victor .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 10]: `` I 'll do ditto in every case ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 23]: said Jack , then caught himself up sharply -- `` when I come to visit the Chosen , that is to say !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: Of course , I 'm out of the running .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 10]: What are you smiling at , Miss Mollie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 19]: For , turning towards her , he had seen the grey eyes light up with a merry twinkle .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 22]: She shook her head , however , refusing to gratify his curiosity , and sped rapidly down the broad marble steps .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: `` He is beginning to have qualms !
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 13]: The very first morning , and for a moment his resolution wavered .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 45]: The spell is working , '' she told herself triumphantly ; for , despite his lack of gallantry , both girls had already candidly admitted that upon Jack 's going or staying depended a great part of the pleasure of the next three months .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 14]: `` Do n't persuade him ; do n't mention the subject at all .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 11]: Let him think we do n't care how he decides .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 26]: Men are contradictious creatures , and the less he is urged the more likely he is to give way , '' argued Ruth the experienced .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 5]: And Mollie dutifully agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: A NOVEL EXPERIENCE .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 35]: Down the winding path , the visitors , as they walked together , came upon masses of daffodils , standing up erect and golden from the carpet of dead leaves which covered the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 68]: Not the ordinary common or garden daffodil , charming as it is , but named varieties of every description -- white trumpeted _ Horsefieldi _ , stately yellow Emperors , _ Bari Conspicui _ with its dainty outline of orange ; these , and a dozen others were growing in patches , not in dozens or scores , but in literal hundreds , beneath the budding trees .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 43]: There were violets , too ; and white and purple and golden saxifrages peeping out between the stones which bordered the trickling stream -- a scene of enchantment , indeed , for City eyes accustomed to gaze only on bricks and mortar .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 34]: The girls were wild with delight , and flitted about gathering specimens of the different flowers ; while the two young men were content to watch them with an air of masculine superiority .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 21]: `` What is the use of burdening yourselves with all those things at the very beginning of our walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 12]: `` They are n't a burden , they are a joy .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 35]: Hold them for me , please , while I get some more , '' replied Mollie , laying a stack of long-stemmed beauties in Jack 's arms , regardless of his look of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 14]: `` Do n't crush them ; I want them kept quite fresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 15]: `` What are you going to do with them , if I might ask ?
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 7]: There are plenty in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 12]: It 's a pity to cut them just to waste . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 14]: `` I would n't waste them for the world , the beautiful darlings !
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 10]: I 'm going to send them home to mother .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 18]: We will pack them in a box , and take them down to the post-office this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 13]: It will provide honest work for the afternoon , '' retorted Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 15]: She was too happy , too supremely happy , to be stiff and formal .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 19]: As she darted from one flower-bed to another she looked like an incarnation of the bright spring morning .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 12]: There was no room in her mind for doubts and fears .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 12]: The future simply did not exist ; the present was all-sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 32]: From the gardens the quartette strolled onwards past the lake , and across the wide park to the further gates ; then , returning , paid a visit to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 33]: The groom greeted them with a smile , which showed that he had anticipated their coming ; and , like the other servants , hailed with delight a return to livelier days .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 35]: `` The horses will get some work now , I hope , ma'am , '' he said , touching his forehead as he addressed himself to Ruth , as the head of the party .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 8]: -LRB- `` The Farrell eyebrows again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: said Mollie to herself . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 14]: `` They have had it far too easy for a long time back .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 42]: The master 's fond of horses , and we need a good many for driving up these steep hills , as everything has to be brought up from the station ; but it 's regular gentle exercise as suits 'em best .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 19]: I 've a nice little mare as would carry you , if you 'd care to try her .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 6]: She 's in this box .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 6]: Fanny , we call her .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 2]: Whoa !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 10]: Fanny , old girl , come and show yourself !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 15]: Nice gentle creature , you see , miss : no temper in her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 13]: `` But I do n't ride , '' began Ruth , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 30]: `` I should like to very much ; and I do n't think I should be nervous , but -- '' `` Oh , I 'd love to ride !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: Is there a horse for me , too ?
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 9]: And would you teach us -- would you ?
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: Could we come down every day and have a lesson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 4]: interrupted Mollie impetuously .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 22]: And the groom wheeled round to face her , and touched his forehead again , his face one smile of delight .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 8]: `` Ay , would I , miss !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 5]: Proud to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 13]: Many 's the one I 've taught to ride in my time .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 26]: You settle any hour you like , and I 'll have the horses ready for you , and take you a turn across the park .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 11]: There 's some old side-saddles put away in the loft .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 13]: I 'll have 'em down , and put in order for ye .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 4]: And the gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 13]: You 'll not be needing any lessons , I 'm thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 22]: I think I can manage to sit any horse you have here , '' replied Victor in a slightly superior tone .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 17]: Jack , however , shook his head , and said -- `` No use for me .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 12]: I ca n't ride , and it 's no use beginning .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 9]: I 'm only here for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 13]: The groom looked the surprise he was too well trained to express .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 5]: `` Indeed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 14]: Well , I can give you a mount if you change your mind .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 19]: It would n't take long to get your seat ; and it 's pleasant exercise these spring days .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 9]: The carriages are round this way , miss .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 14]: There 's a pretty little cart you might like to drive yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 21]: He led the way forward ; but while the others followed , Mollie hung behind , blocking Jack 's way .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 14]: Something prompted her to speak , an impulse too strong to be resisted .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 5]: `` Do learn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 4]: she cried entreatingly .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 5]: `` Learn with us .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 5]: Why wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 6]: It would be such fun .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: You said you hated to be idle .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 14]: It would n't be wasted time if you learnt a useful accomplishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 13]: `` Hardly useful to me , I am afraid , Miss Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 7]: I have no money for horses .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 15]: My only acquaintance with them is from the top of a City omnibus . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 10]: `` But you ca n't tell what might happen .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 14]: We might go to war again , and you might want to volunteer .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 5]: You might grow rich .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 23]: Besides , you volunteered to come and stay with the ` Chosen , ' and then you will certainly find it useful .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 11]: So you will join us , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 14]: Jack laughed and hesitated , looking down at the flushed , eager face .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: It seemed a very trifling matter .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 23]: He could not tell that with the acceptance or refusal of this light request the whole of his future destiny was involved .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 24]: He only thought that Mollie was a charmingly pretty girl , and that it would be amusing to practise riding by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 17]: since you put it like that , I ca n't refuse , '' he answered laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 17]: `` We will learn together , Miss Mollie , and good luck to our efforts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 8]: `` But what about the riding-habits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 3]: asked Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 10]: `` We must get them , '' said Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 3]: asked Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 10]: `` At a tailor 's , '' said Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 17]: `` Bond Street , for choice ; only it would be difficult to arrange about fitting .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 23]: I 'm not at all sure that we sha n't have to pay a visit to town on this matter of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 26]: For the present I mean to consult that maid , and see what can be done until we can get habits well made for us .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 5]: And -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 16]: -- there may be some old things stored away somewhere which will come in handy .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 15]: Anyway , I 'm going to begin lessons to-morrow , habit or no habit .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 8]: You can do as you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 39]: As there was no time to be lost , the maid was summoned only to proclaim her inability to manufacture riding attire in the space of twenty-four hours , or to produce the same from the household treasures .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 37]: `` There is the mistress 's habit , of course , but that was locked away with her other clothes ; and even if I could get at it I would n't dare to use it .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: Mr Farrell keeps everything she wore , and nobody touches them but himself .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 20]: There 's a very good tailor at Bexham , miss -- only half an hour 's rail from here .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 12]: Many of the ladies go to him for their things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 10]: `` But we want something now -- at once !
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 5]: Something to wear to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 7]: Surely you can think of something ?
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 24]: Mr Farrell said we were to ask you for everything we wanted , and this is the first thing we have asked for .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 6]: You must suggest something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 4]: cried Mollie imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 29]: Thus adjured , Emma pursed up her lips , and wrinkled her forehead , leant her head on one side , and stared at the ceiling for inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 16]: Presently it came , for the frown disappeared , the lips relaxed into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 33]: `` Well , miss , '' she said , `` there 's the parson 's young ladies ; they are nearly as big as you , though they are still at school .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 26]: They ride with the father in the holiday , for the squire let 's them have a mount from the stables whenever they send up .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 10]: Their habits will be at home , lying idle .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 34]: They are not much for style , of course , but for a few days , until you have time to get fitted yourself -- '' `` Emma , you are an angel !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 6]: It 's a splendid idea !
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 14]: Mrs Thornton begged us to let her help in any way she could .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 29]: We 'll call this very afternoon , when we go down to post off the flowers , and I 'm sure she will be delighted to lend them .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 9]: Now we can have our first lesson to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 4]: That 's glorious !
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 13]: I do hate to wait when I have planned anything nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 27]: At luncheon Mr Farrell made his appearance , and listened with polite indifference to the history of the morning 's doings as volunteered by his guests .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 30]: He asked no questions , made no suggestions , and retired into the library the moment the meal was over for his daily perusal of the _ Times _ .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 49]: Here for the first time he discovered the inconvenience of the novel interruption to his solitude , for the newspaper was missing from its accustomed place , and , on ringing to make inquiries , he was informed that Mr Melland had carried it off to the billiard-room .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 39]: `` Tell Mr Melland , with my compliments , I should be obliged if he would allow me to have it for the next hour -- and order two copies for the future , '' he said grimly .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 17]: And five minutes later Jack appeared in person the bearer of the newspaper and frank apologies .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: `` I 'm really awfully sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 10]: I did not know you had not seen it .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 11]: Would you care for me to read aloud any article ?
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: I should be glad to be of use . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 7]: My eyes are still quite useful .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 8]: I prefer to read for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 26]: Jack had the good sense to depart without further protest , and Mr Farrell stretched himself on his big chair with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 21]: He took no pleasure in his guests , whose bright young presence depressed him by reviving memories of happier days .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 24]: If it had not been for the necessity of choosing an heir , he would have cherished his solitude as his dearest possession .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 40]: He congratulated himself , however , that by reserving one room for his own use he could be still safe from interruption , and , turning to a leading article , read the first few paragraphs with leisurely enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 18]: The writing was excellent , the views irreproachable , in that they exactly coincided with his own .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 34]: He turned with anticipatory pleasure to the article next in order , when the sound of a light tap-tap came to the door , and Ruth appeared upon the threshold , blushing shyly .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 33]: `` Uncle Bernard , Mrs Wolff says that you always read the _ Times _ after luncheon ... Would it be any help if I read aloud what you wish to hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 15]: Sometimes , when pater is tired -- '' `` I am obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 8]: I require no help of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 15]: Is there any other subject on which you wished to speak to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 27]: The tone was so suggestive of concealed wrath that Ruth quailed before it , and the faltering `` No '' was hardly audible across the room .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 17]: Mr Farrell lifted the paper from his knee so that his face was hidden from view .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 14]: `` Then you will forgive my remarking that I prefer to be undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 10]: We shall meet in the drawing-room for tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 22]: Ruth shut the door , advanced a few steps into the hall , and stamped her foot violently upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 34]: The thick Turkey carpet reduced the noise to the faintest echo , but an answering laugh sounded from behind a screen , and Jack Melland 's eyes looked quizzically into her flushed face .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 6]: `` Allow me to sympathise .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 11]: I was sent about my business a few minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 25]: Took back the _ Times _ by request , and ventured to offer to read aloud -- '' `` Oh , so did I !
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 13]: His eyes looked so tired , that I long to do something !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 35]: It 's like living in an hotel , to take everything and do nothing in return , but if he is so cross and glares like that I shall never dare to offer again .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 13]: Do you suppose it will go on like this all the time ?
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 9]: Will he avoid us entirely except at meal-times ?
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 9]: Shall we never get to know him really ?
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 15]: If it is like that , I do n't think I can stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: I shall run away and go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 10]: Jack looked down at her with a kindly sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 12]: `` Ah , well , it 's early days to judge !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 18]: I do n't think it would be consistent with Mr Farrell 's plans to remain a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: Opportunities are bound to arise as the days pass by .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 13]: Do n't worry about it , but enjoy yourself while you can .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 11]: -- I am going to sit out on the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: Will you come , too ?
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 13]: It will be quite warm so long as the sun lasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 34]: They strolled away together , to make acquaintance in a quiet _ tete-a - tete _ , while once more interruption approached the library in the shape of Mollie , primed for battle .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 30]: She rapped at the door , received a low growl by way of reply , and had no sooner crossed the threshold than an infuriated voice startled her ears .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 6]: `` I tell you no !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 5]: I want no help .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: I can read without assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 24]: Am I stone-blind that I can not be left in peace to read my paper , as I have done these forty years ?
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 13]: How many times over have I to answer the same question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 14]: `` But -- but -- I have n't asked you anything yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 4]: gasped Mollie blankly .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 38]: Eyes and lips alike were wide with amazement , but instead of retiring at full speed , as the other two visitors had done before her , she shut the door carefully and advanced towards the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 12]: `` What did you think I was going to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 26]: `` I have already had two interruptions in the last half-hour ; two offers to have my news read aloud -- a thing I detest .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 11]: I conclude you have come on the same mission ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 11]: Mollie shook her head , half penitent , half amused .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 10]: `` Indeed such a thing never entered my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 13]: I was selfish enough to be thinking of myself -- not you .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 5]: Something is worrying me .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 15]: May I sit down and talk to you about it , Uncle Bernard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 17]: She drew forward a chair even as she spoke , and Mr Farrell made no objection .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 32]: The _ Times _ lay on his lap , his thin hands crossed above it , while his sunken eyes were fixed upon the girl 's face with a curious scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 25]: `` If it is any argument about going or staying , I have already explained -- '' `` Ah , but it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 6]: I am going to stay .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 4]: I love staying !
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 26]: I do n't know when I have been so happy in my life as I 've been to-day , wandering about this sweet old place .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 25]: It was the most curious feeling this morning before you were down -- like living in an enchanted castle where the owner had disappeared !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 26]: When I gathered the flowers I felt quite like Beau -- '' She drew herself up sharply -- `` They were such lovely flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 12]: A short laugh proved that the interruption had come too late .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 16]: `` As I said before , Miss Mary , you are not overburdened with modesty !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 11]: I am obliged for my part of the simile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 23]: But the speaker 's eyes were twinkling with quite the most amiable expression Mollie had yet seen , and she laughed unabashed .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 14]: `` Ah , well , one description is as exaggerated as the other .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 13]: I did n't mean to say it ; it just popped out .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 11]: You know that I did n't mean to be rude .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 17]: I wanted to speak to you about something very important -- to us , at least .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 37]: Ruth will be scandalised , but it 's bound to come out sooner or later , and I want to understand our position ... We told you this morning that we proposed to learn riding . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 5]: `` You did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 8]: `` And you made no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 9]: `` On the contrary , I quite approved .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 20]: It is almost essential for your own comfort and convenience it you wish to enjoy a country life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 4]: so we thought .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 7]: But there is one great objection .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 6]: We have no habits . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 14]: `` No ; of course , we have never ridden at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 6]: `` I presume not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 9]: `` And we can not ride without habits .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 30]: Emma , the maid , suggested that Mrs Thornton might lend us her daughters ' just for a few days ; but we can not keep them long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 5]: `` Certainly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 17]: Mr Farrell made his remarks with an air of polite indifference , which was peculiarly baffling .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 28]: It was evident that no lead was to be expected from him , and that Mollie would have to put her request in the plainest possible words .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 37]: Her lips were pressed together in a momentary hesitation between embarrassment and laughter ; then she thought of the lecture she would receive from Ruth if her errand ended in failure , and grew strong again .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 14]: Her eyes met those of Uncle Bernard still fixed intently on her face .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 19]: `` I wanted to ask you what we were to do about them , and about clothes altogether !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 7]: You know we are very poor .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 12]: Ruth and I have fifteen pounds a year to dress on .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 72]: You have never been a girl , so you do n't understand what that means ; but though we can get along on that at home and could look respectable for a few days ' visit , we ca n't manage as we are for three whole months , especially when you wish us to go about , and have parties here , and meet your friends on their own terms .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 31]: We have only those black evening-dresses which you saw last night , and girls ca n't always wear the same things , as a man does his dress suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 6]: `` I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 6]: `` No they ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 7]: So -- '' `` So ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: Mollie 's cheek flushed with a dawning impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 16]: `` Uncle Bernard , do n't you think you make it very hard for me ?
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 23]: After all , it was your wish that we should stay , and we can not put the pater to more expense .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 9]: You said we were to have carte blanche .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 12]: I want to know if that applies to clothes also ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 19]: `` I must say I had not anticipated anything of the sort when I made my remark . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 14]: `` Well then , are you content to have us as we are ?
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 23]: It wo n't be easy or pleasant , but I suppose we _ could _ rub along if you do n't object .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 31]: People would make remarks , and as they are your friends -- '' `` It is a great many years since I have troubled my head about what people say .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 45]: That argument has no weight with me ; but , as you say , you remain here and go into society at my invitation , and it is therefore only reasonable that I should make it possible for you to do so in comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: I am in ignorance as to what is required .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 17]: What sum , may I ask , would you consider sufficient to make up deficiencies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 11]: Mollie 's smile of rapture was a sight to behold .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 19]: The victory was won , and won so easily that there had been no fight worthy the name .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 32]: Her mind flew to Ruth , picturing the scene between them when she retold the conversation ; then turned at a tangent to gloat over the thought of fineries to come .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 3]: `` Ah-ah !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: That 's a difficult question to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 19]: We shall need riding - habits , and summer things , and evening-dresses , and hosts of etceteras .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 27]: I could make myself look respectable for twenty pounds ; I could look smart for fifty ; I could be a vision for a hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 22]: cried Mollie , clasping her hands ecstatically , while once again a faint twinkle showed itself in Mr Farrell 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 15]: His words were , however , as a rule , decidedly damping in tone .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 22]: `` That is interesting to know , but something less bewildering than visions might be more in keeping with ordinary life .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 31]: Very well , then , Miss Mary , order what you please , and tell your sister to do the same , and let the bills come in to me .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 23]: You can run up to town for the day whenever it is necessary , and no doubt you will enjoy the variety .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 10]: Is there anything more you wish to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 22]: He took up the newspaper in sign of dismissal , but Mollie sat her ground , flushing and knitting her brows .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 27]: `` Uncle Bernard , you are an angel , and I 'm ever so much obliged , but please might n't we have a fixed sum ?
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 8]: It would be so much more comfortable !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 20]: If it is left like this , we should not know what you would think reasonable or extravagant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 15]: `` And in the other case , I should not know it of you !
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 11]: No ; it must be left entirely to your discretion .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 12]: Get what you please , and as much as you please .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 5]: I make no restrictions .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 30]: As I have said before , money is no object to me , but it is my great aim at present to understand your position as to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 11]: `` I understand , but it 's very awkward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 3]: sighed Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 17]: Her forehead was puckered with thought ; she stroked her soft little chin in thoughtful fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 17]: `` I should like to please you , but I am so completely in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 12]: A man 's ideas are so different from a girl 's .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 15]: If I get all I think necessary , you may think me extravagant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 7]: `` Very possibly I may . ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 17]: `` And if I get less than the best , you might think me mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 6]: `` Very possibly again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 15]: Mollie made an involuntary gesture of impatience , then laughed and tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 13]: `` Uncle Bernard , it is hopeless to try to understand you .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 30]: There is only one thing to be done ; since I do n't know how to please you , I must take extra good care to please myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 6]: `` A most sensible conclusion !
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 6]: I congratulate you upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 10]: I have , however , one request to make .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 32]: It is my wish that you and your sister should be independent of each other ; each acting exactly as she thinks fit , without reference to the other 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 10]: Is there anything more that you wish to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 18]: If not , may I suggest that I am generally left free from interruption after lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 29]: `` I 'll never come again -- I promise I wo n't , but there is a lot I should like to say if you would let me .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 40]: I 'd like to thank you and tell you how much fun and happiness we shall get out of your generosity ; but , I suppose , if I did you would hate it , and call it gush .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 26]: The best thing I can do is to go away at once ; but you ca n't prevent me thanking you in my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 35]: She looked at him half smiling , half wistful , longing for some sign of softening which might break down the barrier between them , but Mr Farrell did not even meet her glance .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 24]: His eyes had already strayed towards his newspaper ; he was settling himself in his chair and preparing to resume the interrupted reading .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: Mollie turned with a sigh and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 4]: LEARNING TO RIDE .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 43]: The riding-lessons duly began the next day , and , continuing each morning of the week , proved a veritable godsend to the four young people , in providing amusement for hours which might otherwise have hung somewhat heavily on their hands .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 31]: The season was yet too young for outdoor games , and in the early stages of their mutual acquaintanceship it was difficult to keep up a perpetual flow of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 33]: Some occupation of general interest was thus badly needed , and this was supplied by the delightful canters over the moors -- delightful , despite the drawbacks which were inseparable from inexperience .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 62]: On the first morning the girls were kept sternly in hand by the careful groom , each taken in turn for an amble along a quiet road under his own supervision ; while the other strolled about , feeling very fine and large as she held up the skirt of her habit , and nonchalantly flicked her whip to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 34]: From the safe vantage of the ground also it was amusing to watch Jack Melland 's plungings to and fro , and offer him good advice as to the management of his steed .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 32]: Jack , needless to say , disdained the groom 's good offices , and set forth confident of being able to master any horse by the sheer force of his manhood .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 34]: His seat was not elegant , certainly , and for once he was at a distinct disadvantage beside Victor , who looked his best on horseback , and was evidently an experienced rider .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 80]: On the third day the horses were led to the broad road , crossing the well-treed park , and , after half an hour 's patient trotting to and fro , Ruth was started on her first independent canter , which was fated to have an ignominious end ; for the horse , impatient of restraint , increased its pace to a gallop , which swiftly left the groom behind and sent its rider 's composure to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 34]: Her foot slipped from the stirrup , she dropped her whip , clung wildly to the pommel , and , regardless of dignity , screamed for help at the pitch of her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 38]: It seemed an eternity of time , but in reality it was only a couple of minutes , before Victor overtook her , and leaning forward , seized the reins and brought both horses to a halt .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 29]: The groom came running up behind , followed by Jack , jogging painfully up and down on his saddle , while Mollie puffed and panted in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 37]: Their faces were all keen with alarm , but fear changed to amusement at the sight of Ruth with hat cocked rakishly at one side and a thick coil of hair hanging snake-like down her back .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 64]: She looked piteously for comfort , and , meeting only smiles , drew herself up with what was intended to be an air of haughty disdain ; but it is difficult to look haughty when with every moment fresh hairpins are falling to the ground , and with the descent of fresh coils your hat is continually assuming a still more impudent angle .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 10]: `` You _ do _ look a sight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 19]: cried Mollie with sisterly candour , and Ruth beckoned imperiously to the groom to help her to dismount .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 5]: `` Take me down !
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 10]: I 've had enough of this for one morning .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 10]: You must give me another horse to-morrow , Bates .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 11]: I 'll never trust myself on this hateful creature again .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 15]: No , thank you , I prefer to walk on my own feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 50]: She jumped to the ground and stood twisting up her hair , her cheeks aflame with mingled fright and annoyance -- a sight , indeed , as Mollie had remarked , though the young men 's translation of the term was not perhaps precisely the same as her own .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 34]: `` I 'll put in a thousand hairpins next time , '' she said angrily , as she fastened the coils to the best of her ability , and straightened the rakish hat .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 19]: `` You had better see that your hair is safe , Mollie , before you have your turn .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 17]: I am going to sit down on the grass and jeer at you for a change .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 15]: It 's so easy to be superior when you are doing nothing yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 26]: `` I sha n't hang on to my pommel , anyway , and I wo n't call , ` Help , murder , thieves ! '
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 8]: whatever happens , '' cried Mollie lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 22]: `` I am going round this curve , so you can all watch and see how well I do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 41]: She flicked her horse 's side as she spoke with quite a professional air of unconcern , and started off at a brisk canter , holding herself resolutely erect , despite the ever-increasing pain in the small of her back .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 5]: Echoes of `` Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 3]: bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 12]: followed her down the path and goaded her to increased exertion .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 47]: A second flip on Prince 's back sent him forward at such a surprising increase of speed that , involuntarily , she gripped the pommel ; then , remembering her resolve , let go her hold to hang on more and more tightly to the reins .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 10]: Prince tossed his head and gave an expostulatory amble .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 9]: Mollie set her lips and pulled the stronger .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 40]: She was not conscious that the right hand pulled more strongly than the left , but that it did so was proved by the fact that the horse gradually abandoned the path and directed its course across the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 32]: The watchers behind gave cries of warning as they saw what was happening , but in her agitation Mollie mistook their meaning for more applause and dashed headlong on her way .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 46]: She was so much occupied in keeping her seat that she had no eyes to discover danger ahead , but the groom looked with dismay at the low - spreading trees on right and left , and raced across the grass to intercept her progress .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 7]: He was too late , however .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 34]: Maddened by the incessant dragging of the reins Prince galloped ahead , skirting so closely a clump of trees that it was only by crouching low over the saddle that Mollie escaped accident .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 34]: The watchers drew deep breaths of relief , but renewed their anxiety as once more horse and rider disappeared from sight behind a giant elm , whose branches hung threateningly towards the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 50]: Ruth gripped her habit in both hands and sped across the grass after the groom ; the two young men galloped ahead ; and from one and all came a second cry of alarm , as a moment later Prince sounded his appearance careering wildly along riderless and free .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 7]: What were they going to see ?
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 19]: A helpless form stretched on the ground ; a white unconscious face ; a terrible , tell-tale wound ?
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 44]: A dozen horrible pictures suggested themselves one after the other in those breathless seconds ; but when the fatal spot was reached there was no figure upon the ground , senseless or the reverse ; no Mollie was seen to right or left .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 50]: It seemed as if the earth had opened and swallowed her up , until a feeble squeak made the rescuers lift their eyes suddenly to the heart of the tree , where a black skirt and two small kicking feet were seen swinging to and fro in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 41]: Another step forward showed the whole picture , gauntleted hands clutching wildly to a bough , and a pink agonised face turned over one shoulder , while a little pipe of a voice called out gaspingly -- `` Catch me !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 3]: hold me !
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 4]: take me down !
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 5]: oh , my arms !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 10]: I 'm falling , falling , I 'm falling !
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: oh , oh , oh -- I 'm falling down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 24]: And fall she did , so suddenly and violently that the groom , although a stoutly built man , tottered beneath her weight .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 83]: The ordinary heroine of fiction is so frail and ethereal in build that when she faints away , under a stress of emotion , the hero gathers her lovely form in his arms and carries her for a couple of miles with delightful ease ; but Mollie Farrell was a healthy , well-grown girl ; and for one agonising moment it appeared as if the sequel to the adventure was to be an ignominious tumble to the ground of rescuer and rescued .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 15]: The moment passed , the groom steadied himself with an involuntary `` Whoa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 22]: and Mollie turned to confront her friends , swaying painfully to and fro , with crossed hands pressing against each shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 6]: `` Oh , my arms !
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 3]: my arms !
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 8]: They are torn out of their sockets !
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 5]: I know they are !
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 7]: The pain is really hideous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: `` What happened ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 12]: How did you manage to perform such an acrobatic feat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 52]: cried Jack , now that anxiety was appeased , unable to resist a smile at the remembrance of the pretty , comical picture , and the undignified descent to the ground ; but Mollie snapped him up sharply , her sense of humour absolutely eclipsed by the pain she was suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 7]: `` It was n't a feat !
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 66]: I saw the bough before me and I thought I should be killed , and I put out my hands to save myself and -- I do n't know how it happened ; but the next moment that horrid , wicked animal slipped from under me , and my arms were jerked nearly out of my body , and I was left dangling in mid-air .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 13]: It 's perfectly hateful of you all to stand there and laugh !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 15]: I might have been killed outright if it had n't been for Bates . ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 23]: `` You were only a yard or so from the ground ; you could have dropped down yourself without making a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 18]: I kept my seat at any rate , and I did n't howl half so loudly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 4]: said Ruth self-righteously .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 18]: `` What made you do anything so mad as to ride in among all those trees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 5]: `` I did n't !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 27]: It was the horse ; he would go , whatever I did , '' protested Mollie feebly : whereupon Bates shook his head with solemn disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: `` We 've got to be very thankful as matters is no worse , '' said the alarmed groom .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 29]: `` I shall have a fine lecturing from the squire when he hears of this , but you will bear me witness as it was against my wishes .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 28]: If I 'd had my way you would never have ventured off by yourselves , for another week at least , but there was no gainsaying you .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 21]: I 'm thinking you 'll have had about enough lesson for to-day , and I must look after those horses .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 19]: To-morrow -- '' `` To-morrow we 'll be good and docile , and do as you tell us .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 35]: My nerves are too shaken to be disobedient ; but do n't be afraid ; you sha n't be scolded for what is n't your fault , '' said Ruth with her pretty smile .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 17]: Bates touched his cap and walked off , mollified , while the girls turned sadly homeward .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 32]: Jack and Victor offered their escort , but , finding it impossible to disguise all traces of amusement , were promptly snubbed and bidden to go and be superior by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 6]: `` I do hate men !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 6]: horrid , patronising creatures ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 9]: cried Mollie pettishly , as she limped onwards .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 23]: `` They think themselves so grand because they are stronger than we are , and have no tiresome skirts to hamper them .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 12]: I do n't like riding half as much as I expected .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 18]: I 'm so stiff and sore , I should like to go to bed for a month .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 7]: I shall lie down this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 63]: I 'll get a nice book , and pull the sofa up to the window , and have tea brought up to me ; and I just hope it will rain and pour , and they will have nothing to do and be bored to death , and then they will miss me , and be sorry that they were so rude .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 19]: Laughing , indeed , when I was in danger of my life , before their very eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 18]: `` You were safe enough before they laughed , and you did look funny hanging in mid-air !
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 24]: You did n't think it was cruel to laugh at me , and I was just as much frightened as you were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 16]: retorted Ruth ; and thereafter a frigid silence was maintained until the Court was reached .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 18]: At lunch Mr Farrell appeared with a clouded brow , and vouchsafed only monosyllabic replies when addressed .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 57]: It was evident that something had displeased him , and , though no reference was made to the adventures of the morning , the young people had discovered by now that he possessed a mysterious power of knowing all about their actions , in sight or out of sight , and felt correspondingly ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 18]: When the meal was over and the servants had left the room , the storm burst suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 19]: The sunken eyes gleamed with an angry light , and the tired voice sounded unusually loud and threatening .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 23]: `` Has neither of you two young men the sense or the prudence to prevent a lady from running a foolish risk ?
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 16]: I am informed that Ruth was in danger of having a serious accident this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 58]: I am not personally able to look after her safety , and she was possibly ignorant of her own folly in attempting more than she could accomplish ; but I had imagined that in my absence she had two sufficient protectors -- one of whom , at least , I understand to be an accomplished horseman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 13]: Victor flushed deeply , and the lids fell over his tell-tale eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 15]: `` No one regrets Miss Ruth 's fright more than I do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 27]: She had been such an apt pupil that I did not imagine that there was any danger in trying a little canter on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 14]: Bates disapproved of it , but I am afraid I sided against him .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 12]: I can only promise to be more careful in future . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 19]: `` It was no one 's fault but my own , Uncle Bernard , '' interrupted Ruth eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 24]: `` I was conceited and thought I could do anything I liked , and I have learnt a lesson -- that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 26]: I was frightened , but I hung on so tightly to the pommel that I do n't think there was any real danger of falling .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 13]: I really will be careful not to run any more risks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: `` I trust you will .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 32]: I feel responsible for your safety while you are under my roof , and it will be a severe strain on my nerves if I can not rely on your discretion .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: Are you feeling any ill effects from your fright ?
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 33]: Can Mrs Wolff help you in any way , or perhaps the doctor -- '' Ruth gave an involuntary exclamation of surprise and protest , and the colour rushed into her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 28]: It was so surprising , so extraordinary that Uncle Bernard should betray such concern for her safety and actually suggest sending for a doctor on her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 33]: Her heart beat high with the conviction that she was , indeed , his favourite , his Chosen , and that therefore her safety was all-important for the success of his scheme .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 22]: She turned her grey eyes upon him with a liquid glance of gratitude , as she faltered out words of acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 11]: `` Oh no , indeed , it is quite unnecessary !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: Thank you so much all the same .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 23]: I am vexed with myself for having upset you by being so headstrong , and did n't hurt myself a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: `` That is well , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 13]: Mr Farrell rose from the table and turned slowly towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 39]: As he did so he found himself suddenly confronted by another face -- a bright-eyed , mutinous girl 's face , so transparently charged with speech that he stopped short , uttering an involuntary inquiry -- `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 4]: what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: What have _ you _ got to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 13]: Mollie 's lips parted , her head tilted to the side . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 9]: _ I _ was in danger , too !
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 6]: much more than she was .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 7]: I _ did _ tumble off !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 10]: I hung on to the branch of a tree .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 9]: I might have been injured most dreadfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 4]: `` Ah-ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 5]: said Mr Farrell slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 12]: He turned his head aside , and his lips twitched uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 3]: `` You !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 17]: But you , my dear Mary , can take such uncommonly good care of yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 5]: MOLLIE DEFENDS HER UNCLE .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 13]: Mr Farrell walked to the door , and shut it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 14]: Everyone stood still , staring at Mollie , and Mollie stared ruefully back .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: she cried breathlessly , `` oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 10]: and pressed both palms to her now scorching cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 14]: `` I 've never been snubbed like that in all my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 15]: Then suddenly she laughed a bright , sweet-hearted laugh , utterly free from envy .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 31]: `` I 'm nowhere , Ruth , when you are concerned ; but there 's one comfort , I can do as I like , and no one will interfere !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 18]: If it is to be a choice between the two , I prefer freedom to riches . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 19]: She left the room to make her way upstairs , and Jack crossed the hall by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 28]: He looked intently at her as he walked , and when their eyes met he said simply -- `` You took that well -- very well indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 9]: I congratulate you on your self - control .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 12]: I could not have kept my temper as you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 4]: returned Mollie easily .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 9]: `` I brought it on my own head .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 36]: It was stupid to speak of myself at all ; but just for the moment I could n't help feeling aggrieved , because , really and truly , I was in greater danger than she .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 15]: Uncle Bernard is old , poor thing , and that makes him querulous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 6]: `` It ought not to .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 8]: I call that a very poor excuse .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 25]: When a man gets to his age he ought surely to have learnt to be patient , even if he imagines himself provoked . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 8]: `` But he is ill as well .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 6]: You say nothing about that .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 8]: Should that make him patient too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 5]: `` Certainly it should .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 9]: Suffering has often a most ennobling effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 33]: Mollie stood on the first step of the staircase , her arm on the banister , looking with a challenging smile into the proud self-confident face on a level with her own .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 11]: `` Have you ever been ill , Mr Melland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 11]: `` I am thankful to say I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 21]: `` But you have surely had a pain , or an ache , for a few hours at a time ?
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 14]: Ear-ache , when you were a child , or toothache later on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 14]: I 've had my share of toothache , and the smaller ailments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 17]: `` And when the spasms were on , -- were _ you _ gentle and patient ?
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 21]: Did you feel your character being ennobled , or did you rage and champ about like a mad bull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 3]: Jack laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 25]: It was impossible to resist it , at the sight of the mischievous face , and the sound of the exaggerated , school-girl simile .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he conceded magnanimously , `` perhaps the champing was the more in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 12]: I was not citing myself as a model , Miss Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 17]: I know quite well that -- that I might be more patient than I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: `` More patient !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 2]: More !
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: You are not patient at all .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 10]: You are the most impatient person I ever met .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 18]: If anyone dares even to have a different opinion from you , you can hardly contain yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 8]: I wish you could see your face !
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 6]: You look like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 67]: Mollie drew herself up , making a valiant attempt to draw her eyebrows together , send out lightning sparks from her eyes , inflate her nostrils , and tug the ends of an imaginary moustache at one and the same time ; and succeeded in looking at once so pretty and so comical that , instead of being convicted , Jack laughed more heartily than before .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 6]: `` As bad as that ?
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: I must be ferocious !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 25]: It 's rather unkind of you to pitch into me like this , Miss Mollie , when I have just been paying you compliments .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 20]: It 's a good thing I am going away so soon , as I am such a desperate character .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 20]: There is no saying to what lengths Mr Farrell and I might get if we were long together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 14]: Mollie 's face sobered , and a little chill came over her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: `` You are still determined , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 11]: Nothing has happened to make you change your mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 7]: `` What should have happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 5]: replied Jack the ungallant .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 20]: `` There has been nothing behind the scenes , Miss Mollie -- nothing that you do not know of .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 14]: Only I prefer to go back to my work -- that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 28]: I consented to remain for a week to please Mr Farrell , but I do n't see that I am called upon to make any further sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 22]: I have my life 's work before me , and just now it needs all the attention I can give it .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 27]: Besides , Mr Farrell and I would never get on ; I should be a disturbing element which would not improve matters for any of you .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 20]: Between ourselves , I think there is little doubt who will be the Chosen , as you express it .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 8]: Your sister is evidently first in favour .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 9]: Witness your experience a few minutes ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 9]: Mollie stared before her , thoughtful and absent-minded .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 19]: One word in Jack 's speech had detached itself from the rest and printed itself on her brain .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 2]: Sacrifice !
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 28]: He had stayed at the Court for a week as a matter of necessity , and did not feel called upon to sacrifice his inclinations any further .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 4]: Sacrifice , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 36]: The word rankled the more as she realised how differently she herself had described the past five days , and how high Jack Melland 's presence had ranked among the pleasures of the new life .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 31]: When she projected her thoughts into the future , and imagined living through the same scenes without his companionship , it was extraordinary how flat and dull they suddenly became .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 34]: But he called it a `` sacrifice '' to stay away from a dingy , dreary office , and preferred the society of his partner to all the Mollie Farrells in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 48]: He liked her , of course -- she could not pretend to doubt that ; but just as a grown man might care for an amusing child who served to while away an idle hour , but who was not worth the trouble of a serious thought .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 19]: `` He thinks I am shallow , '' thought Mollie sorrowfully , and then suddenly inverted the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: `` Am I shallow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 13]: she asked herself , with an uneasy doubt creeping over her self-complacency .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 25]: `` I expect I am , for I am content with the surface of things , and like to laugh better than to think .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 19]: But I 'm twenty ; I do n't want to be treated as a child all my life .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 11]: It 's horrid of him to talk of sacrifices ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 18]: Thoughts fly quickly , but , even so , the pause was long enough to be unusual .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 23]: Jack looked inquiringly at the thoughtful face , and said smilingly -- `` Why , Miss Mollie , you look quite sober !
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 8]: I never saw you so serious before .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 14]: Is that because I said that your sister was preferred before you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 9]: That aroused Mollie to a flash of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 11]: `` No , indeed ; I am not so mean .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 23]: I 'd almost sooner Ruth had things than myself , for I 'd have all the fun and none of the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 22]: Besides , she wants it more than I do , and would be a hundred times more disappointed to do without .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 11]: And then you must not blame Uncle Bernard too much .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 11]: He had a good reason for saying what he did .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 4]: I deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 10]: -- You will never guess what I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 6]: Jack looked amused and curious .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 9]: `` Nothing very dreadful , I feel sure .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: You are too hard on yourself , Miss Mollie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 28]: `` I asked him for heaps of money to buy heaps of new clothes -- '' Jack 's whistle of amazement was too involuntary to be controlled .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 31]: He tried his best to retrieve himself by an expression of unconcern , but the pretence was so apparent that Mollie laughed at the sight , albeit a trifle ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 17]: `` Do you mean to tell me seriously that you asked Mr Farrell for money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 6]: `` Yes , I did .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 6]: I asked him on Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 35]: It seemed the only thing to do , as he wants us to entertain his friends , and go out whenever we are asked , and we had n't enough clothes to go in .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 12]: Ruth would n't ask , so I had to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 36]: We have no evening-dresses in the world except those black things that you see every night , and we ca n't live in them for three months like a man in his dress suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 7]: `` They are very pretty dresses .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 9]: I am sure you always look charming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 17]: `` Oh , do n't feel bound to be flattering , I hate obvious compliments ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 4]: cried Mollie irritably .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 10]: She was surprised to realise how irritable she felt .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 19]: `` I only told you because it was mean to let poor Uncle Bernard get the blame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 23]: She paused , and over her face flashed one of those sudden radiant changes of expression which were so fascinating to behold .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 15]: Her eyes shone , her lips curled , a dimple dipped in her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 30]: `` But he _ did _ give it to me -- he gave me more than I asked -- carte blanche , to spend as much as I liked !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 21]: Next Tuesday morning as ever is , we are going up to town to shop with Mrs Thornton as assistant .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 4]: Think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 4]: Think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 27]: Oxford Street , Regent Street , Bond Street -- just to look in at all the windows in turn , and buy what one likes best .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 41]: Hats , '' -- two eager hands went up to her head -- `` dresses '' -- they waved descriptively in the air -- `` coats ; fripperies of all descriptions , delicious blouses for every occasion , and evening-dresses !
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 15]: -- oh , chiffon and lace and sequins , and everything that is fascinating !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 34]: I 've never had anything but the most useful and long-suffering garments , though I have yearned to be fluffy , and now I shall be as fluffy as I can be made !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 29]: Think of me , all in tulle and silver gauze , with a train yards long , all lined with frills and _ frills _ of chiffon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 34]: cried Mollie ecstatically , tilting her head over her shoulder , and pushing out her short skirt with a little slippered foot as if it were already the train of which she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 9]: `` Indeed , I will think of you !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 19]: I wish I could do more than think ; I should like to see you into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 15]: It is hard lines that I have to leave before the exhibition opens . ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 13]: `` Oh , pray do n't pose as an object of pity !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 12]: Whose fault is it that you are leaving at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 4]: retorted Mollie quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 27]: `` You have made up your mind to go , and it 's a matter of pride with you that nothing or nobody shall prevent you .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 37]: My poor fineries would be a very weak inducement ; but you will have to reckon with Uncle Bernard before you get away , and I do n't think he will be easy to oppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 15]: Jack Melland straightened himself , and his nostrils dilated in characteristic , high-spirited fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 17]: `` When I make up my mind I never give way , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: Mollie tossed her head defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 18]: `` So you say ; but there is something even stronger than will , Mr Melland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 10]: `` And that is -- '' `` Fate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 4]: cried Mollie dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 25]: The blue eyes and the brown met in a flashing glance ; then the girl dropped a demure curtsey , and ran lightly upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 5]: IN THE VILLAGE CHURCH .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 27]: The shopping expedition was , by common consent , postponed until the middle of the following week , when Jack Melland would have taken his departure .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 10]: `` Let us make hay while the sun shines .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 21]: Three is an abominable number , especially when you happen to be the third , '' said Mollie , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 10]: `` Mr Druce admires you very much , Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 36]: I often see him staring at you when you are not looking ; but when I appear upon the scene his eyelids droop , and he does not deign even to glance in my direction .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 11]: He puzzles me a good deal , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 31]: I rather fancy myself as a judge of character , but I ca n't decide whether he is really a model of virtue , or a villain in disguise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 7]: Ruth made a movement of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 8]: `` How exaggerated you are , Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 12]: Why must you rush off to extremes in that foolish fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 20]: Mr Druce is probably neither one nor the other , but just an ordinary combination of faults and virtues .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 36]: He is kind and considerate to Uncle Bernard , and very chivalrous to us ; -- a hundred times more so than Jack Melland , who certainly does not err on the side of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 22]: Personally , I do n't think any the less highly of people because they are little reserved and uncommunicative at first .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 24]: It will be time enough to judge Mr Druce 's character when we have known him for weeks , instead of days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 36]: I believe in first impressions , '' insisted Mollie obstinately ; `` and so do you , really , or you would not bristle up when I dare to cast a doubt on his excellence .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 47]: You are going to like him , Ruth , I can see that quite clearly , and he admires you ; so , as I said before , I shall be the poor little pig who stays at home , while you two wander abroad together .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 41]: It 's not exactly the programme which my fancy painted when we came down ; but if I devote myself to Uncle Bernard , and cut you both out , I shall have the best of it , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 30]: Perhaps , too I may make friends with someone in the neighbourhood , -- there is always the chance of that , and I do love meeting new people .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 21]: I suppose callers will begin to arrive after we have made our first public appearance at church to - morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 18]: I am quite excited at the prospect of seeing all the people -- are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 10]: `` I am not going , '' said Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 18]: And when Mollie exclaimed and cross-questioned , she flushed uncomfortably , but did not refuse to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 20]: `` I have made up my mind to go to early service , but not again at eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 26]: It 's not that I do n't want to go ; it 's because I want to go so much -- for the wrong reasons !
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 68]: Ever so many times during the last few days I have caught myself thinking about it , and imagining the scene -- everybody staring at us , while we sit in the squire 's pew trying to look unconscious , but really enjoying it all the time , and building castles in the air about the future , when we may have a right to be there .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 30]: We should be thinking most of all of ourselves , and that 's not a right spirit in which to go to church ; so I 'm not going .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 13]: I 'm disappointed , but I 've made up my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 13]: Mollie leant her head on her hand and gazed thoughtfully before her .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 67]: The sisters were seated in the great round window of their bedroom , from which such a glorious view of the surrounding country could be obtained ; and as Mollie 's eyes wandered from the blue of the sky to the fresh green of the trees , and anon to the patches of golden daffodils among the grass , a wonderful sweetness softened her young face .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 6]: `` But God understands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 4]: she said gently .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 13]: `` He made girls , so He must know how they feel .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 23]: This is a great occasion for us , and it is natural that we should be excited and a little bit self-engrossed .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 33]: Mother would think it natural , and make excuses for us , even if we were carried away by our new importance ; and God is kinder and more forgiving than mother .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 33]: Perhaps , when one is quite old and staid , it is easy to sit through a service and never think of self ; but it is difficult when one is young .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 62]: I used to be miserable because every time I had a new hat or dress , or anything that was fresh , I could n't help remembering it and being pleased that I looked so nice , and hoping that other people liked it too but when I thought it over I came to the conclusion that it was only natural .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 7]: Look at that lovely view ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 10]: She waved her hand expressively from right to left .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 55]: `` When God made the world so beautiful and so full of colour , He must mean us to love pretty things without being ashamed of it ; so now I just thank Him for the new things in my prayers , and remember them as some of the things to be thankful for .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 9]: I 'm sure it 's the best way .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 15]: It 's cowardice to stay at home because we are afraid of a temptation .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 57]: Surely it would be far better to go , to thank God for giving us this good time , and to ask Him to send us nice friends , and , if it be His will , to let Uncle Bernard leave us the Court , so that we may help them all at home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 38]: She broke off , looking round half timidly in Ruth 's face , for it was reversing the usual roles to find herself laying down the law as to right and wrong to the serious-minded elder sister .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 9]: Would Ruth be annoyed -- shocked -- disapproving ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 31]: It appeared that she was not , for the troubled lines had gradually smoothed away from her forehead , and she cried heartily -- `` Yes , you are right .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 5]: I feel you are !
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 10]: Thank you for putting it so plainly , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 31]: I _ did _ want to go to church , and now my conscience will be clear , so I can go comfortably , feeling it is the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 33]: But oh , Mollie , shall we all four be praying , one against the other , each one wanting to disappoint the others , and keep the Court for himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 16]: `` Jack Melland wo n't , for one ; and I wo n't for another .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 18]: I 'm not sure that I want it and all the responsibility that goes in its train .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 25]: I 'd honestly rather it were yours , dear ; then I could come and sponge upon you as often as I liked . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 4]: `` Sponge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 4]: echoed Ruth reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 16]: `` As if it would be any pleasure to me if you were not here !
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 10]: What would become of poor Berengaria without her Lucille ?
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 55]: We are so grand in real life now that we forget the dear old game ; but , when we are back in Attica , we shall be able to play it better than ever , now that we really know what it feels like to be rich and have everything one wants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 44]: Mollie did not answer , and both girls sat silently gazing before them , while their thoughts wandered northwards to a shabby , crowded house , and to a sloping-roofed attic under the leads , in which so many hours had been spent .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 31]: Mollie smiled , remembering the little make-shifts and contrivances , seeing the humour of them , and feeling again the glow of triumph with which each difficulty had been surmounted .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 10]: Ruth shuddered with a mingling of fear and repulsion .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 16]: Oh , how bare it was -- how poor , and small , and unlovely !
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 26]: the few small rooms , the shabby furniture , the little plot of grass in front of the door which did duty as a garden .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 26]: Could it be possible that in a few short months she might have to return and take up life once more under the old conditions ?
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 34]: The thought of Dr Maclure 's handsome house had been a distinct temptation to her when he had asked her to be his wife ; then how much more the beautiful old Court ?
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 10]: `` I would do anything to get it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: thought poor Ruth desperately .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 14]: `` Oh , if I could only find out what Uncle Bernard wants !
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 12]: It is terrible to be in the dark like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 55]: The next day was Sunday , and the ordeal of church-going proved to be much less trying than had been expected , for the congregation was mainly composed of villagers , who looked too stolid and sleepy to trouble themselves about the appearance of strangers , even when seated in the squire 's pew .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 29]: The pew , moreover , was situated in the front of the chancel , so that it was all the easier to pay whole-hearted attention to the service .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 30]: Coming out through the churchyard , the girls were conscious of glances of interest directed towards themselves by various little parties who plainly composed the gentlefolk of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 55]: At the gate one or two carriages were waiting in readiness to convey their owners home , the best appointed of which was presently occupied by an old lady and gentleman , whom Ruth recognised from Mrs Thornton 's description as being the couple whom the renowned Lady Margot Blount was about to visit .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 30]: She said as much to Mollie , when the carriage had passed by , and the four young people were strolling together in easy country fashion along the road .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 7]: `` Did you notice , Mollie ?
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 14]: Those must be Mr and Mrs Blount , who live at the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 11]: I should know them anywhere from Mrs Thornton 's description .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 17]: I wonder whether they will call , and if Lady Margot Blount will come with them ?
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 10]: She was expected this week , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 25]: She was interrupted by a sharp exclamation , and turned with her two companions to stare in amazement into Victor Druce 's transformed face .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 36]: For once amazement had broken down the veil which gave a tinge of mystery to his personality ; his sallow cheeks showed a streak of colour , and his eyes were wide open and eager .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: `` Lady -- Margot -- Blount ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 4]: he repeated incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 7]: `` Here , in this village !
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 15]: You say she is expected to meet those people who have just driven past ?
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 4]: Is it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 7]: Who told you about her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 15]: Ruth stared at him , amazed in her turn by his energy of manner .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 15]: `` Mrs Thornton told us so , the night she dined at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 29]: We asked her what girls were in the neighbourhood , and among the number she spoke of Lady Margot as a constant visitor to her uncle and aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 6]: Why are you so surprised ?
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: Do you know her in town ?
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 8]: Is she a friend of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 10]: Victor hesitated , biting the ends of his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 9]: `` I can hardly call her a friend .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 19]: We are not in the same set ; but I saw a good deal of her last autumn .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 21]: Some people I know were getting up tableaux for a charity bazaar , and asked us both to take part .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 42]: There were a good many rehearsals , so that we grew for the time pretty intimate ; but she went off to Egypt for the winter , and I have heard nothing of her since the night of the performance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 12]: `` But have thought a good deal all the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 21]: said Mollie shrewdly to herself , looking at the dark face , which looked so handsome in its unaccustomed animation .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 15]: If Victor Druce often looked like that , he would be a fascinating companion .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 17]: To have the power so to influence him and excite his interest would be perilously attractive .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 36]: A few hours before , Mollie had been almost prepared to declare that she distrusted and disliked this new acquaintance ; now she was conscious of a distinct feeling of envy towards the unknown Margot .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 9]: `` How interesting that you have met already !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 19]: Mrs Thornton was so enthusiastic in her praise , that she roused our curiosity to fever - pitch .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: Do tell us what she is like !
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 7]: We are longing to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 10]: But Victor did not appear inclined to be communicative .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 16]: The heavy lids fell over his eyes , and he murmured a few non-committal sentences .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 18]: It was difficult to describe a girl so as to give any real idea of her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 7]: He was not skilled at word-painting .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 20]: If Lady Margot was so soon expected , would it not be better to wait and judge for themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 12]: Mollie shrugged her shoulders impatiently , and forthwith began her catechism .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 5]: `` Tailor short ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 13]: `` Er -- medium ; not small , not too tall . ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 5]: `` The perfect mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 3]: I understand !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 5]: Dark or fair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 8]: `` Dark eyes , chestnut hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 8]: `` Oh , that 's not right .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 12]: She has no right to monopolise the beauties of both complexions .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 12]: And chestnut hair , too , the prettiest shade of all !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 18]: Is she a real , true beauty , or only just pretty , like ordinary folk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 17]: `` That must be a matter of personal opinion , must n't it , Miss Mollie ?
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 9]: Ideas vary so much on these subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 4]: `` Checkmate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: sighed Mollie to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 33]: `` He wo n't say what he thinks , and I ca n't be so rude as to ask directly , though it 's just what I 'm dying to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 41]: Aloud , she said carelessly , `` Oh , I 've no doubt I shall think her lovely , and adore her as I do all lovely people ; that is , if she does n't scare me too much .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 15]: Is she formidable and _ grande dame _ , or lively and easy-going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 36]: `` That again must surely depend upon circumstances , '' replied Victor sententiously , whereat Mollie tossed her head , declaring that he was as aggravating as Uncle Bernard himself , and almost as enigmatical .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 14]: As for Ruth , she walked along with compressed lips and frowning brows .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 39]: It was not possible for a girl to find herself thrown into close companionship with two young men , and not wonder in the recesses of her heart if perchance friendship might not eventually develop into something warmer .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 32]: Ruth and Mollie had both thought and dreamed , and to each it had occurred that possibly some such ending of the great problem might have occurred to Mr Farrell himself .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 51]: There was no barrier of near relationship to prevent two of the young people making a match , if they were so disposed ; and while Uncle Bernard , so far , seemed to favour his elder niece , he had expressly stated that he would prefer a male heir .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 73]: Ruth 's favour was not easily won , but as both young men appeared agreeable , gentlemanly , and good-looking , it had been a distinctly pleasant experience to look forward and wonder if he , -- if I , -- if perhaps some day , long ahead , when we know each other well ... All girls have such dreams , and understand how their existence adds savour to a situation .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 36]: It was not a little trying , then , when Jack Melland insisted on returning to town , and Victor Druce , in his turn , must needs betray an undoubted interest in another girl .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 5]: `` Tiresome thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 22]: murmured Ruth to herself ; referring , needless to say , not to Victor , but to the innocent Margot herself .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 17]: `` I knew I should dislike her from the moment when Mrs Thornton mentioned her name .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 29]: Why could n't she be happy in town , with all her grand friends , instead of rushing down here to interfere with us the moment we arrive ?
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 58]: She is sure to hear the reason why we are here -- everyone knows it ; and if she is mercenary she will like Victor better now that he has a chance of inheriting the Court , and , when he knows her connection with the neighbourhood , she will seem to him more desirable than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 98]: Uncle Bernard would be pleased , and think her a suitable mistress for the Court , and they will get everything , and we 'll get nothing , and go home as failures ... Mother will be disappointed , and everything will be duller and pokier than ever ... '' So on and so on , conjuring up one gloomy vision after another , as was her unhappy custom , until at length she saw herself stricken in years , broken in health , lonely and unloved , with nothing in prospect but a pauper 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 19]: A strange ending , indeed , to that first public appearance from which so much had been expected !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 2]: KISMET .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 30]: When Sunday evening arrived Jack Melland was surprised to feel a distinct strain of regret in realising that it was the last evening he should spend at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 62]: He was still not only determined but eager to return to his work at the beginning of the week , and had counted the hours until his release should arrive ; but , as the days passed by , he had become increasingly alive , not only to the beauty of his surroundings but to the unusual charm of feminine society .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 49]: After a lonely life in London lodgings , it was an agreeable experience to come downstairs to a perfectly appointed meal , set against a background of tapestry and oak , to be greeted by bright girlish faces , and kept amused and interested from morning till night .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 31]: Mollie was a fascinating little creature -- witty , audacious , and sweet -- hearted , though , as yet , too much of a school-girl to be taken seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 25]: As for Ruth , she was a beauty , and might become dangerous to a man 's peace of mind on a longer acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 41]: That was an additional reason why Jack was set on leaving the Court , for , as she was obviously first favourite , it would be a distinct stroke of diplomacy for a man to link his chances with hers .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 34]: Jack 's nostrils inflated in characteristic manner as he told himself , that this would not be his fashion of going a-wooing , but he was less scrupulous in prophesying for his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 8]: `` Druce will make love to her !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: she 'll marry Druce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 36]: he told himself confidently ; and his thoughts flew ahead to the time when the young couple would reign over the Court , and dispense the favours which were now in Bernard Farrell 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 8]: Well , it was a goodly heritage !
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 14]: Even in seven short days several scenes had printed themselves upon his memory .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 48]: The drive across the park , with the great north front of the house lying grey and chill in the distance ; the south terrace flooded with sunshine ; the gardens sloping to the level of the lake ; and beyond them the open stretch of country .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 14]: And in all probability Druce was to be the master of it all .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 25]: He seemed a good enough fellow , but was he worthy of the position , and of the wife who would go with it ?
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 6]: Would he make her happy ?
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 7]: -- the sweet , beautiful thing !
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 14]: Happiness did not come easily to her as it did to her sister .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 32]: If her husband neglected her , or fell short of her ideal , the wistful expression , which was one of her charms , would soon develop into a settled melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 28]: Jack conjured up a vision of Ruth 's face -- emaciated and woebegone -- and felt a pang of regret , allied with something curiously like remorse .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 34]: It seemed as if by going away he were deliberately leaving her to Druce 's tender mercies , so certain did he feel as to the result of the three months ' companionship .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 17]: For the first time a rankling doubt of the wisdom of his decision disturbed his complacency .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 62]: When he was back in his dingy lodgings would he think longingly of the Court , and reproach himself for having thrown aside the chance of a lifetime ; and if the business failed , despite all his efforts , and he found himself thrown adrift on the world , how should he feel then , remembering what might have been ?
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 43]: These reflections brought a frown to Jack 's brow , but he was too proud to show any sign of wavering to his companions ; and in the old man 's presence was careful to make no allusion to the coming departure .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 38]: On Monday morning the subject was to be officially discussed ; but , until the prescribed hour arrived , it would have been a brave man or woman who dared open it in Mr Farrell 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 59]: As for Mr Farrell himself , so far from looking forward to the interview with foreboding , he seemed in an unusually amiable frame of mind as he took the head of the table on Sunday evening , actually deigning to question his guests as to the day 's doings , and the impressions which they had received .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 24]: In their replies the young men were , as usual , brief and practical , Ruth tactfully reserved , and Mollie unflatteringly honest .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 26]: But to-night Mr Farrell seemed determined to take no offence , and even vouchsafed a grim smile at the sound of the quaintly vigorous language .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 29]: `` You will have to curb that rebellious tongue of yours , my dear Mary , if you are to get through the next few weeks without trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 29]: The good people about here are not accustomed to such picturesque exaggerations , and will take everything you say as literal fact , so you had better beware .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 31]: You will probably have a number of visitors this week , so it would be as well to arrange to be at home as much as possible in the afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 38]: Calling is a more serious business in the country than in town ; and when people have taken the trouble to drive eight or nine miles , it is a disappointment to find nobody at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 24]: He turned towards Jack , and continued : `` Of course , this restriction does not apply to you , or to Druce .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 28]: Your presence will not be expected ; and if you agree with me , the further afield you can be , the better you will be pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 35]: There are some charming excursions which you could manage in an afternoon 's ride , and , from what I hear , your horsemanship has improved so rapidly that you could easily manage them .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 25]: Bates will be happy to give you any directions you may require ; or , still better , to accompany you as guide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 42]: These remarks were so markedly addressed to Jack , that no one but himself could venture to reply , and his self-will was so much ruffled by the deliberate ignoring of his expressed determination that he was instantly aflame with wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 44]: His nostrils curved , his brows arched , his lips opened to pronounce a sharp disclaimer , when suddenly he caught sight of Mollie 's face gazing at him across the table ; and if ever a face cried `` Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 19]: with all the eloquence of pleading eyes and parted lips , Mollie 's said it at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 36]: The message was so unmistakable and ardent that it demanded obedience , and to his own surprise Jack found himself murmuring conventional words of thanks , instead of the heated disclaimer which he had intended .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 25]: Later on in the evening he followed Mollie into a corner of the drawing - room to demand a reason for her unspoken interference .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 22]: `` It was not honest to seem to agree when I have no intention of being here for a single afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 9]: Why would n't you let me speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 18]: he demanded ; whereupon Mollie pursed her lips , and said thoughtfully -- `` I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 17]: You were going to be cross , and it is Sunday -- our first Sunday here .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 12]: I did n't want it to be spoilt by angry words .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 12]: If you must disappoint the old man , do it gently .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 11]: Do n't answer back , even if he is annoying .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 19]: You will be glad afterwards -- when he is dead , and you have nothing to regret . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 8]: Jack looked down at her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 16]: Was this the pert school-girl , whom he had just deemed unworthy of serious consideration ?
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 33]: The face into which he looked seemed of a sudden that of a woman rather than that of a child -- soft and sweet , grave-eyed , with lovely , serious lips .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 14]: The very voice was altered , and had an added richness of tone .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 27]: It was like catching a glimpse into the future , and beholding the woman that was to be , when girlhood 's bright span was over .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 10]: Instinctively Jack 's manner altered to meet the change .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 12]: The supercilious curve left his lip , his keen eyes softened .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 12]: `` Thank you , Miss Mollie , '' he said gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 6]: `` You are quite right .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 5]: I 'll remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 32]: She thanked him with a luminous glance , and turned away ; but he wanted to see her again , to hear her speak once more in that beautiful new voice .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 16]: Before she had taken three steps he called to her eagerly -- `` Miss Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 3]: One moment !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 41]: I expect I shall be packed off , bag and baggage , as soon as I have announced my decision ; but Mr Farrell does not make his appearance until lunch-time , so we have a whole morning left still .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 13]: Will you come for a last ride with me after breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Mollie simply .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 30]: Her heart beat high with pleasure , because Jack had assented so readily to her request , because he had wished to spend his last hours in her society .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 20]: For the moment she forgot the blank which would follow his departure , and was wholly , unreservedly happy .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 20]: It was the old , sparkling , girlish face which was turned upon him -- the vision had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 24]: The next day neither Ruth nor Victor offered to join the riding-party , though they had not any settled plans for the forenoon .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 32]: Mollie had told her sister of Jack 's invitation of the evening before , and Ruth was too proud to make a third unless she were specially asked to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 39]: She strolled into the grounds to interview the gardener about sending in an extra supply of plants and flowers to beautify the house for the expected callers , while Victor shut himself in the library to write letters .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 39]: Jack looked well on horseback , as tall , upright men always do , and Mollie glanced at him admiringly , and thought regretfully of her new habit , which was even now in the tailor 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 36]: It did seem hard that she should have to wear a shabby , ill-fitting coat while he was here , and that the new one should come home almost as soon as he had departed .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 26]: Her sigh of self-commiseration brought his eyes upon her , and he sighed in echo as he cried -- `` Last times are melancholy occasions !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 14]: I hate them , even when the experience has not been altogether pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 16]: There is a sadness about turning over the leaf and ending another chapter of life .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 13]: This chapter has been a very short one , but uncommonly jolly .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 16]: Do n't think that I have n't appreciated it , because I am going away .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 28]: I have enjoyed every hour of this week , and when I am back on the treadmill I shall think longingly of you all many times over .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 9]: I hope we may often meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: `` It is not very likely , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 12]: You will go your way , and we will go ours .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 14]: Ruth and I have never been in London , nor you in Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 42]: We may all live until we are old and bald , and never meet again , '' said Mollie dismally ; whereupon Jack looked at the shining plaits which were coiled at the back of her head , and laughed reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 29]: `` I ca n't imagine you bald , nor old either , and I expect to see you many times over before you have the chance of changing .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 51]: The Chosen , whoever he or she may be , must surely have the good manners to invite the rest of us to visit a house which might have been our own ; and I have a special claim , for by retiring from the lists I increase your chances .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 23]: Personally , I have made up my mind to spend many holidays here -- shooting and riding , and enjoying myself generally .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 16]: I hope you wo n't object , if you happen to be the chatelaine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 8]: `` Ah , but I sha n't !
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 31]: I have no chance against the other two ; but I also intend to spend my holidays here , and I tell Ruth she must send home hampers every week .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 44]: It has always been my ambition to get hampers , and she could send such splendid ones from the Court -- game and poultry and eggs , and nice out-of-season fruits and vegetables , which would be such a help in the housekeeping !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 39]: I am afraid sometimes that we count too much on Uncle Bernard 's fancy for Ruth 's eyebrows , for if he changed his mind and left everything to Mr Druce , it would be a terrible disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 9]: And there are three months before us still .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: He may change a dozen times yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 8]: `` I think most probably he will .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 21]: Better stick to your resolution , to have a good time , and not bother your head about the future .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 11]: I shall be most anxious to know how things go .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 12]: Druce has promised to send me a line now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: Will you jog his memory in case he forgets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 26]: Mollie promised , all the more readily that Victor 's letter would naturally bring a return , which would serve to bridge over the separation .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 21]: It seems curious to remember that little over a week ago she had not known of Jack Melland 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 28]: He had made but a brief appearance upon the scene , but it would not be easy to forget him , or to fill the vacant place .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 51]: Both riders relapsed into silence as they neared home ; but , as they clattered into the stable-yard , Jack turned towards Mollie with rather a forced air of triumph , and cried -- `` Do you remember your warning , Miss Mollie , that Fate was stronger than will ?
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 35]: Ever since we set out this morning the words have been ringing in my ears , and I have been expecting some accident to happen which would keep me here in spite of myself .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 20]: I have looked for it at every turn of the road as if it were bound to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 4]: Mollie shivered nervously .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: `` Oh , how horrid !
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 9]: I am glad you did not tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 15]: I should have been nervous , too , for I am superstitious about presentiments .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 7]: They so often come true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 10]: `` Well , this one at least has not .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 14]: Here we are safe and sound , and all risk is over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 26]: cried Jack , dropping his reins , and jumping lightly from the saddle without waiting for the groom to come to the horse 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 41]: He was anxious to assist Mollie to dismount before Bates came up ; but even as his feet touched the ground he slipped , staggered uncertainly for a moment , and sank to the ground with a groan of pain .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 22]: The groom rushed forward ; Mollie leapt inelegantly but safely to the ground , and bent over him with anxious questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 19]: His face was drawn with pain , and he bent forward to grip his foot with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 5]: `` My -- ankle !
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 15]: I slipped on something , or came down on the side of my foot .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 22]: I do n't know how it was done ; but I 've given it a bad wrench , if nothing worse .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 13]: You 'll have to cart me up to the house , Bates .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 12]: I 'm afraid it 's hopeless to try to walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 7]: `` No , indeed , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 5]: Do n't you trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 12]: I 've got an old bath-chair stored away in the stables .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 20]: We 'll lift you into that in no time , and take you up as easy as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 15]: He turned off as he spoke , and Jack and Mollie were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 23]: For a moment she stood silently by his side ; then their eyes met , and he said wearily -- `` Kismet !
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 7]: Fate is too much for me .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 22]: For better or worse , Miss Mollie , it is evidently ordained that I must stay on at the Court ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 3]: NEW EXPERIENCES .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 23]: The village doctor came to doctor Jack Melland 's damaged ankle , and the patient fumed and fretted beneath his old-fashioned treatment .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 21]: `` Bandaging me and laying me up by the heels for weeks at a time ; it 's folly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 4]: he declared angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 10]: `` The man is twenty years behind the times .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 26]: If I were in town I should have had one of those Swedish fellows to massage it , and be about in half the time .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 21]: Just my luck to go in for an accident in a place where one ca n't get proper attention ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 23]: `` But you groan if anyone comes near your foot ; would n't it hurt dreadfully much to have it massaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 3]: Mollie asked .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 9]: Whereupon the invalid growled impatiently -- `` Hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 6]: Of course it would hurt !
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 11]: What has that to do with it , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: `` Lots , '' returned Mollie , unabashed .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 15]: `` I should think so , at least , if it were my ankle .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 7]: I ca n't endure pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 17]: `` I 'm not a girl , '' growled Jack the ungracious , between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 15]: There was no denying the fact that he did not make an agreeable invalid .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 43]: In the first realisation of his accident he had meekly bowed his head to Fate ; but ever since he had , figuratively speaking , kicked against the pricks , and repaid the kindness of his companions by incessant grumblings and complaints .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 44]: He hated having to give up his own way ; he hated being tied to a sofa and a bath-chair ; he resented offers of help as if they had been actual insults , and hindered his recovery by foolhardy attempts at independence .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 13]: `` How would you like to be an invalid for life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: Mollie asked him severely after one of these outbursts .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 41]: `` There was a young man in mother 's district , every bit as strong and big as you , and a sack of something fell on his back while they were trying to haul it up into a warehouse .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 24]: He was taken to the hospital , and they told him that he would never walk again , never even sit up again .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 12]: As long as he lived he would be a helpless cripple .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 12]: And he was just going to be married , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 11]: `` Well , I 'm not , thank goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 4]: cried Jack bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 10]: `` Why do you tell me such gruesome stories ?
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 9]: My own troubles are quite enough just now .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 11]: I do n't want to hear any more horrors . ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 16]: `` It was just to distract your mind from yourself that I did tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 23]: Once upon a time I met a man who read me a beautiful lecture upon the dangers of being selfish and self-engrossed .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 12]: I 'll tell you his very words , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 16]: They made a deep impression upon me at the time , '' said Mollie naughtily .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 12]: But instead of being amused , Jack was only irritated afresh .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 82]: In these first days of invalidism Mollie 's influence was the reverse of soothing , for Jack was not in the mood to be teased , and if his inner determination could have been put into words it would have been that he objected to be cheered up , refused to be cheered up , and insisted upon posing as a martyr ; therefore , it followed that Ruth 's gentle ministrations were more acceptable than her sister 's vigorous sallies .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 65]: If he could have seen again the Mollie of whom he had caught a glimpse on Sunday evening , Jack would have chosen her before any other companion ; but , as she had made place for a mischievous tease , he preferred to look into Ruth 's lovely anxious eyes , and to dilate at length upon his symptoms to her sympathetic ear .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 17]: Mr Farrell 's behaviour at this critical juncture did not throw oil upon the troubled waters .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 69]: He took care that Jack should have every attention , and inquired as to his progress with punctilious regularity ; but he plainly considered a sprained ankle a very trivial affair , which , needless to say , did not coincide with the invalid 's views of the case ; moreover , he absolutely refused to believe that the accident was responsible for keeping Jack at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 90]: `` It is only right to tell you , sir , that I had finally made up my mind that I must return home to-day , as I could not agree with your conditions , '' Jack informed him on their first interview after the doctor had paid his visit ; whereupon the old man elevated his eyebrows with that air of ineffable superiority which was so exasperating , and said -- `` And I , on the contrary , had made up my mind that you should stay .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 15]: It is satisfactory to me that the question is decided in my favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 7]: `` By an accident , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 5]: By an accident only .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 20]: If I 'd been able to move -- '' Mr Farrell held up his hand with a deprecatory gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 22]: `` In that case I should have called your attention to certain arguments which would have brought about the same result .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 15]: Believe me , my dear Jack , it would have made no difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 6]: Jack 's face flushed angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 31]: He forgot Mollie 's entreaty , forgot his own promise , and answered hotly -- `` I can not imagine any arguments that could keep me here against my will .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 15]: As soon as I can get about again I must return to my work .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 14]: This accident is only delaying my departure for a few weeks longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 16]: Could anything be more aggravating than that little bow and smile which accompanied the word .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 27]: `` In a few weeks , my dear Jack , many things may happen ; therefore , it is superfluous to discuss the subject at present .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 13]: When the time arrives I shall be ready to meet it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 17]: He turned and left the room , while Jack raged in helpless fury upon the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 21]: It was insufferable to be treated as if he were a boy who could be ordered about against his will .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 45]: When John Allen Ferguson Melland said a thing , he _ meant _ it , and not all the old men in the world should move him from it , as Bernard Farrell would find out to his cost before many weeks were past .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 54]: For three whole days Jack 's ill-temper continued , and , like most angry people , he punished himself even more than his companions , refusing to sit in the drawing-room to see callers , and insisting on remaining all day long in a dull little room at the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 6]: He grew tired of reading .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 39]: His head ached with the unusual confinement ; just because he was unable to move he felt an overpowering desire for half a dozen things just out of reach , and the day stretched to an interminable length .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 56]: On the fourth morning depression had taken the place of ill - temper , and he was prepared to allow himself to be petted and waited upon , when , to his dismay , Victor came to his bedroom with the news that the girls had gone up to town , accompanied by Mrs Thornton .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 25]: `` They said , as you preferred to be alone it would be best to keep to their plans , '' said Victor cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 24]: `` I am off for a ride , and shall probably make a day of it , and lunch _ en route _ .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 8]: I was thinking of going to Barnsley .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 7]: It is quite a decent-sized place .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 17]: Would you like me to try if I could find a masseuse for your foot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 13]: Jack looked up sharply ; but Victor looked as he usually did .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 17]: His face was set and expressionless , as it always was when his eyes were hidden .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 41]: It was natural enough that he should make such a suggestion , seeing that he had heard many lamentations on the subject , natural and kindly into the bargain , yet Jack felt an instinctive unwillingness to accept the offer .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 28]: `` He wants me out of the way , '' came the leaping thought , while he bit his lip , and appeared to ponder the question .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 23]: A few days before he himself had heartily echoed the sentiment ; but now that Fate -- or was it something else ?
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 17]: -- had interfered to keep him at the Court , Jack 's views had slowly altered .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 42]: It might be that there was a duty waiting for him here , some duty which was even more important than his work in town ; and , if he shirked it , the consequences might fall upon others besides himself .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 40]: The two girls ' faces rose before him , -- Ruth 's shy and anxious , Mollie audaciously reckless , -- children both of them in the ways of the world , though innocently confident of their own wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 24]: If by staying on at the Court he could safeguard their interests , it would be well-spent time which he should never regret .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 33]: To Victor 's astonishment his offer was quietly but firmly refused , and he set out on his ride marvelling what had happened to bring about such a sudden change of front .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 21]: Meantime , Ruth and Mollie were enjoying their first experience of that most delightful feminine amusement -- shopping in London .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 53]: They drove to the doors of world-famed establishments , entered with smiling self - confidence , and gave their orders , unperturbed even by the immaculate visions in black satin who hastened forward to receive them ; so marvellous and inspiring are the effects of a purse and a cheque-book behind it !
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 22]: Mrs Thornton was purse-bearer , and , to do her justice , enjoyed the occasion as much as the girls themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 50]: She had been personally interviewed by Mr Farrell and coached for her part , which was to chaperon the girls , take them to the best places in which to procure their various requirements , but on no account whatever to direct the purchases , or limit their extent .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 53]: `` It is a good test ; I wish to study it , '' said the old man , which speech being repeated , Ruth looked grave , and Mollie laughed , and cried -- `` There is only one question I shall ask you , ` Do I look nice ? '
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 13]: and one piece of advice , ` Which suits me best ? '
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 9]: and you are free to answer them both .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 21]: In the present instance these hats are all so fascinating that it would be a sin to choose between them .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 7]: I shall take them all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 8]: `` Mollie , do n't be absurd .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 8]: You shall do nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 9]: Four hats , and you have two already !
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 7]: It would be wicked extravagance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 4]: protested Ruth vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 17]: But Mollie persisted , and the attendant volubly declared that indeed `` madam '' was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 8]: Six hats was a very moderate allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 27]: Madam would need different hats for different occasions , -- for morning and afternoon , for fine and wet weather , for ordinary and dress occasions .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 26]: Would she herself not be persuaded to try on this charming model , the latest French fashion , `` ridiculously cheap at three guineas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 16]: `` Thank you , I 'll take the white hat , and the black chiffon .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 12]: They will answer all my purposes , '' declared Ruth frigidly .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 52]: She was shocked at Mollie 's wanton extravagance , and all the more disapproving that she herself badly wanted to be extravagant too , and wear dainty colours for a change , instead of the useful black and white , if only her sensitive conscience could have submitted to the outlay .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 20]: If hats had been a pitfall , dresses were even worse , for here the prices were largely increased .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 64]: It was a new experience to be ushered into what looked more like a luxurious house than a shop , and to find oneself confronted by a row of tall , willowy young women dressed in tightly fitting black satin garments , so marvellously representing dress-stands that they might have been mistaken for them had it not been for the elaborately dressed heads .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 41]: `` This is a very expensive place -- just for your very best dresses , '' Mrs Thornton ventured to explain ; and the order , `` Summer gowns for these young ladies , '' having been given , presto !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 38]: the animated dress-stands disappeared through a doorway , to return a few minutes later to promenade slowly up and down the floor before the dazzled eyes of the beholders , each one attired in a different costume .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 31]: Blue , green , white , lavender , and yellow -- perfect of cut , distracting of make -- it was , indeed , a problem to choose between them !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: And while they hesitated , lo !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 14]: another disappearance , and another triumphal entrance even more gorgeous than the first .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 44]: `` If I thought I should look as nice as they do , I 'd have four at least , but I sha n't ; my waist is twice as big , and I never learnt to glide , '' sighed Mollie humbly .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 9]: `` How much is the blue , please ?
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 9]: I think that would suit me best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 14]: The price of that simple -- looking frock gave Ruth an electric shock .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 12]: It was actually more than the whole of her yearly allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 32]: She looked it over , making a rapid estimate of the cost of material and trimming , and felt convinced she could have bought them all out of a five-pound note .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 9]: And then it could be made at home .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 10]: Ah , no , that was just the difficulty !
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 17]: The material was a detail , in the making-up thereof lay all the charm and effect .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 27]: She came out of her calculations to hear Mollie say calmly -- `` And I shall want them both home by the end of a week !
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 17]: Now my sister will choose , and after that we will see some evening gowns . ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 28]: Ruth took her courage in both hands , ordered one dress , and took advantage of the first moment of solitude to rebuke Mollie in irritable undertones .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 8]: `` Do think what you are about !
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 17]: I 'm the eldest , and it 's most unsuitable for you to be better dressed .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 13]: You ought to let me decide , and follow my example . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 17]: `` But I promised Uncle Bernard that that was just what I would not do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 16]: `` Even if you did , he never intended you to order a whole trousseau .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 11]: How will he feel when he sees the bills ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 18]: `` I do n't know ; I think he will feel nice when he sees my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 13]: Oh , Ruth , do enjoy yourself when you have the chance !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 16]: He gave you carte blanche -- why on earth ca n't you take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 11]: But that was just exactly what Ruth could not do .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 32]: The fear of the bill -- the fear of Uncle Bernard 's displeasure , loomed so largely before her eyes , that she dared not indulge her longing for needless fineries .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 31]: In every shop the same story was repeated , Mollie giving a lavish order with beams of satisfaction , Ruth reducing hers by half , and feeling sore and aggrieved .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 35]: Each appealed in turn to Mrs Thornton for support and approval , until that good lady became quite dazed and bewildered , and was thankful to find herself once more in her quiet home .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 20]: Arrived at the Court , Mollie danced up to Mr Farrell , who sat reading by the library fire .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 21]: `` I 'm back again , Uncle Bernard , '' she cried ; `` I 've had a beautiful time !
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 11]: I do n't think I ever enjoyed myself so much !
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 7]: I 'm bubbling over with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 7]: I 've spent heaps of money !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 27]: You said I might , and I 've taken you at your word ; and oh , I have got such lovely things in exchange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 12]: Mr Farrell looked at her grimly , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 15]: His eyes turned towards his other niece , who stood silently in the background .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 16]: `` And you , '' he queried , `` have you been equally fortunate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 5]: Ruth 's face clouded .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 17]: `` I got what I needed , '' she said ; `` I have a headache .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 8]: I 'm going upstairs to rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 4]: MOLLIE 'S REVENGE .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 6]: Three weeks had passed by .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 36]: May had begun -- an old-fashioned , well - conducted May -- which was really like a foretaste of summer , instead of the shivery disappointment which so often condemns us to fire and furs .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 38]: Jack 's ankle was still troublesome , and though he could limp a few steps with the aid of a stick , his outdoor exercises were for the most part restricted to peregrinations in the old bath-chair .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 32]: According to his account the period had been one of much tribulation , when patience and forbearance had been tried to their limits by the unnatural conduct of Miss Mollie Farrell .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 51]: Instead of behaving like the proverbial ministering angel , Mollie proved uncertain , coy , and hard to please , and so full of mischievous pranks that Jack declared that his hair was turning white , though , if the truth be told , he looked remarkably bright and happy .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 26]: One morning it happened that a chance remark of Jack 's offended Miss Mollie 's dignity , and she vowed that she would be revenged .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 51]: It seemed , however , that she had forgotten her displeasure for when Ruth and Victor went off to the village after lunch , she offered herself for the post of chairman , and wheeled the invalid to his favourite position beneath a flowering chestnut in front of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 32]: The ankle was comfortable , and Jack , having lunched well , felt at peace with mankind and womankind into the bargain , and quite inclined to enjoy a pleasant talk .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 42]: No sooner was he settled , however , than Miss Mollie drew a book from her pocket , and sitting down on the grass at a few yards ' distance , deliberately turned her back upon him and began to read .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 42]: Jack watched these proceedings in silence , recognising both that he was being punished for having annoyed his companion in the morning , and also that he could not better frustrate her intentions than by preserving an appearance of undisturbed complacency .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 35]: Accordingly , he sat quietly , studying the pretty figure in the blue linen dress , and noticing with satisfaction that the pages were flicked over more rapidly than was consistent with careful reading .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 11]: The book was evidently dull -- so much the better !
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 12]: Miss Mollie might find her own punishment even heavier than his .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 14]: He himself had nothing to read , but that did not distress him .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 45]: A man is not to be pitied if he can not make himself happy for an hour or so , even with a sprained ankle , when there is a charming landscape to gaze upon , of which a pretty girl makes the foreground .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 42]: Jack smiled lazily to himself as he thrust his hand into the tail-pocket of his coat , but his expression changed tragically as his fingers groped in vain for the bulky pouch which he had refilled just before leaving the house .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 12]: Now , what in the world had happened to that pouch ?
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 9]: Could it have fallen out of his pocket ?
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 2]: Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 11]: It was too securely weighted down by its own size .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 28]: It could not have fallen , but it could easily have been stolen by the hands of his mischievous charioteer as she wheeled him across the grass .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 44]: Jack had no doubt that that was exactly what had happened , and he congratulated himself on having smothered an exclamation of dismay , as he saw Mollie 's head lifted cautiously from the pages as if to listen for the expected explosion .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 25]: Jack smiled to himself , knowing full well that her patience would soon be exhausted , and with it the limit of his punishment .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 23]: It would be a joke to pretend to be asleep when , at last , it pleased her ladyship to turn round !
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 23]: The little witch no doubt was fully aware how pretty she looked , and fondly imagined that he was wrapt in admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 16]: It would be a useful snub to find that he had forgotten all about her .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 28]: So Jack rested his head against the cushions of his chair , folded his arms , and kept his eyes rigorously shut for the next few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 70]: He felt delightfully at ease , and the rays of the sun shining through the branches were at once so subdued , and so comforting , that it came to pass that what he had plotted in fun came about in earnest , and at the end of a few minutes his lids were tightly closed , and his breath came through his lips in long , regular respirations .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 9]: Mollie heard the sound , and smiled derisively .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 17]: `` As if I should believe for one moment that he had gone to sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 44]: said she to herself , with a tilt of the saucy head ; but as the moments passed by , the perfection of the imitation began to disturb her equanimity ; the last breath , for example , approaching perilously near a snore !
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 27]: She turned cautiously , inch by inch , until a glimpse of the bath-chair could be obtained , with a fair head drooping upon the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 4]: Jack was asleep !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 17]: Actually , and in very truth he had calmly slumbered off in defiance of her displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 19]: Mollie arose in her wrath , and stood over the unconscious figure , meditating upon the next step .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 64]: If Jack Melland imagined for one moment that she was going to mount guard over his slumbers , he would find himself vastly mistaken ; yet she dared not leave him unprotected , for the ground sloped away from the tree , and a violent movement on the part of its occupant would be enough to send the chair racing down the incline .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 32]: She stood and pondered , then , drawing a handkerchief from her pocket , crept on tip-toe to the back of the chair and tied the handle to a convenient bough .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 68]: It would be almost impossible for Jack , crippled as he was , to raise himself and turn round sufficiently to undo the knots ; so , after testing their firmness a second time , Mollie took a circuitous path to the house , there to amuse herself for an hour or more , until Mr Jack had time to awake and repent himself of his audacity .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 6]: The awaking came unexpectedly quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 48]: Perhaps Jack 's slumbers had been disturbed by Mollie 's movements , quiet though they had been ; certain it is that she was hardly out of sight before he stirred uneasily , blinked once or twice , and finally sat erect in a spasm of remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 41]: He had fallen asleep , not in pretence but in actual fact ; for how long he had slept he had no idea , but meantime the bird had flown , no doubt with feathers much ruffled by wounded pride .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 44]: Jack did not believe that Mollie had gone out of sight ; he pictured her standing a few feet away , squeezed up against the branches of a tree , with blue skirts held tightly together lest a fold should betray her presence .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 41]: Anxiety for his safety would soon bring her rushing to his side ; so he threw himself back in the chair to set it a-going ; failed to make it move , jolted forward , and again found it immovable .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 26]: Then he grew suspicious , and craning over his shoulder beheld the tell-tale handkerchief with the tight little knots twisted purposely well out of reach .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 31]: So this was Mollie 's revenge , to leave him stranded in the middle of the park until such time as it might please her to set him at liberty !
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 17]: Jack hardly knew whether to be more amused or indignant at the sense of his helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 37]: It seemed so preposterous that a chit of a girl should be able to keep him prisoner , that for a moment he seriously contemplated getting out of the chair and limping back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 25]: How contrite she would be when she returned to find the chair empty ; how full of contrition , and anxiety about his welfare !
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 49]: The prospect was not unpleasant ; but after nearly a fortnight 's invalidism , he dreaded doing anything to retard convalescence , and the more he measured with his eye the distance to the house the more convinced he became that it was beyond his power to accomplish .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 29]: It would be ignominious , indeed , to have to give in half-way , and be discovered by his tormentor sitting prone upon the ground waiting her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 58]: Jack determined to be wise in his generation and remain where he was ; but it was dull work sitting alone , without paper or book to while away the time , and as his chair was turned away from the drive he had not even the distraction of watching for the return of Ruth and Victor .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 32]: He took out his pocket-book , searched through its contents for anything of interest , made a few calculations on an empty page , and thrust it impatiently into his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 66]: Then he studied his strong white hands , trying to imagine that they looked thin and delicate , carried out a systematic search through every one of his pockets , lest , perchance , anything at all interesting might have wandered into one of them by mistake ; looked at his watch and groaned to find that it was still a full half-hour to tea-time .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 30]: At last when patience was well-nigh exhausted , the crunch of footsteps on the path delighted his ears , and he called out a vociferous greeting -- `` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 4]: are you back ?
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 5]: Thank goodness for that .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 9]: I was just looking out for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 16]: The footsteps came to a momentary pause , then crunched on again quicker than before .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 17]: Jack cleared his throat and roared still louder -- `` I say , I 'm here !
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 20]: Do n't go without me ; I 'm alone ; I want to go up to the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 19]: Silence still ; another pause and then a deliberate walk onwards , which roused Jack to veritable anger .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 40]: This was evidently not Ruth but Mollie , and Mollie must be taught that there was a point when a joke ceased to be a joke , and that , bound or free , Jack Melland must be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 18]: When he spoke again his voice was not loud any longer , but cuttingly cold and severe .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 22]: `` Will you kindly come here and unloose my chair ; I refuse to be kept a prisoner any longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 31]: The footsteps paused abruptly ; the swish of a silken skirt came across the grass , and a woman 's clear , high-bred voice cried abruptly -- `` A prisoner !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 7]: Oh , what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 8]: Please tell me what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 21]: I would have stopped at once , but I did not think you could possibly be talking to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 45]: Jack looked up in amaze , and beheld a tall girl clad in grey , a little head beautifully poised on an unusually long neck , and a pale , oval face , out of which looked a pair of deep , violet eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 62]: The stranger was not beautiful , not even pretty , but in the way she spoke , in the way she moved , in the way she stood looking at him , with the folds of her dress held together in one slender hand , there was an air of distinction which marked her out from the ordinary run of womankind .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 47]: Jack felt overcome with embarrassment as he remembered his imperious summons , and so much at a loss to explain his predicament that for a few moments he could not find words , but just lay back in his chair staring at her with horrified eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 26]: The stranger evidently perceived his embarrassment , for she came a step forwards and said tactfully -- `` I think you must be Mr Melland .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 5]: May I introduce myself ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 33]: My name is Margot Blount I have been lunching at the vicarage , and took the opportunity of calling upon Miss Farrell before the carriage comes back for me at five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 20]: I shall be so glad if I can be of any service to you _ en route _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 9]: `` Thank you ; you are very kind .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 36]: I am awfully sorry that I should have shouted at you in that threatening way , '' said Jack , smiling in his most fascinating manner , and he could be remarkably fascinating upon occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 36]: `` The truth is I am a cripple at present with a sprained ankle , and my -- er -- attendant has chosen to run away , and leave me tied up to this tree .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 12]: I was getting tired and impatient , hence the summons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 19]: `` Ah , '' exclaimed Lady Margot , smiling , `` I can guess who the attendant was !
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 8]: Miss Mollie Farrell , was it not ?
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 19]: I have heard so much of her from Mrs Thornton that I am quite longing to see her .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 12]: Is she at home this afternoon -- and her sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 30]: `` I am not sure about Miss Farrell ; she went out for a walk after lunch ; but in any case she is sure to return very soon .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: Miss Mollie is -- somewhere !
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: It is impossible to be more explicit .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 15]: Probably some of the servants will be able to find her for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 14]: `` I hope so , but first what can I do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 11]: Shall I untie this noose and set you free ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 10]: `` Thank you ; I should be much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 18]: Then , perhaps , you would kindly ask the butler to send someone to bring me in .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 10]: I shall hope to see you later on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 17]: Lady Margot rustled to the back of the chair , and bent over the knotted handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 40]: It was tied as if the knots were never intended to be undone , and presently she paused to take off her gloves before attacking it again , while Jack expostulated and apologised for the trouble he was giving .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 63]: Finally , regardless of her light draperies , Lady Margot knelt down on the ground so as to work more conveniently , and in the midst of her efforts a saucy face peered suddenly round the corner of a tree a few yards distant , and Mollie hove into sight , with head thrown back and arms a-kimbo in would-be threatening attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 32]: From her position Jack 's broad shoulders hid from view the grey figure behind the chair , and he guessed as much , and took a wicked delight in the thought .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 30]: `` Well , Mr Melland , I hope you feel refreshed by your slumbers , and have awakened in a better frame of mind , '' cried Mollie loftily .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 31]: `` Will you say you are sorry , and be taken to have tea on the terrace , or be obstinate and stay here by your lonesome little self ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 28]: `` Neither , thank you ; I have been fortunate enough to find a friend in need , so am no longer dependent on your good offices .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 15]: Allow me to introduce you -- Miss Mary Farrell -- Lady Margot Blount ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 4]: said Jack dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 2]: Tableau !
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 16]: Mollie 's arms dropped to her sides and her face grew scarlet under the garden-hat .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 28]: So far from rising to her position as hostess , it was the visitor who came forward to shake hands and speak the conventional words of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 19]: It was , indeed , a cruel Fate which sent just this visitor at just this very time !
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 47]: Half a dozen times over during the last fortnight had Mollie donned one of her grand London dresses and sat primly in the drawing-room , with intent to receive Lady Margot in style , and impress her with a sense of her own dignity and importance !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 27]: And then to be discovered behaving like a mischievous school-girl , and be taken at such a disadvantage that she could not even find her voice !
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 5]: It was too annoying !
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 6]: `` Good-afternoon , Miss Farrell !
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 15]: I was coming up to the house to call upon you and your sister .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 33]: I am so happy to have found you at home ; and , do you know , I believe Mr Melland will have to fall back upon your help , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 9]: My efforts have not been at all successful .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: You tie such good knots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 29]: cried Lady Margot , in a tone of enthusiasm which seemed to imply that the tying of knots was one of the rarest and most valuable of accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 28]: Looking into her face , Mollie 's embarrassment died a sudden death , and she found herself smiling back with a delicious sense of comradeship and understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 8]: `` Oh , I know the trick .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 23]: I can undo them in a moment , and then wo n't you come and have tea with us on the terrace ?
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 18]: It is all ready , and it seems a sin to be indoors on this lovely day .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 26]: My sister will be there waiting for us ; she was just coming up the path by the lake as I turned the corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 8]: `` Oh , that is nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 4]: said Lady Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 44]: She looked as if she were about to ask another question , but checked herself , and strolled along beside the bath-chair , chatting alternately to Jack and Mollie with an ease and grace which might have come from long years ' acquaintanceship .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 36]: As they turned the corner of the terrace she was a step in advance , and Mollie saw her stop short for the fraction of a moment while the colour rushed into her pale cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 53]: She had surprised a pretty little tableau -- a tableau to which the inhabitants of the Court had grown accustomed during the last few days -- Ruth seated on her chair , her lovely head drooped shyly forward , Victor leaning impressively towards her , his dark eyes bent on her face .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 42]: They were too much engrossed to hear the approaching footsteps , but the sound of the chair crunching over the gravel at last aroused their attention , when Victor turned round , and leapt to his feet , white and breathless .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 5]: `` THE OGRE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 37]: It was not a successful tea-party ; for the fact of Victor 's previous acquaintance with Lady Margot , so far from acting as a bond of union , seemed to cast a constraint over all .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 11]: The meeting between the two had been cool and unnatural .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 40]: They persistently avoided speaking to or looking at each other , and it seemed to Mollie 's critical ear as if even Lady Margot 's voice had altered in tone since she had turned the corner of the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 21]: She chatted away as easily as before , but the friendly manner was replaced by something colder and more formal .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 102]: As she sat with veil turned back , the full rays of the sun shining upon her face , it became more obvious than ever that , in spite of chestnut hair and violet eyes , Lady Margot fell far short of beauty ; but , none the less , the eye dwelt upon her in fascinated attention , so graceful was the pose of the small , stag-like head , so finely cut the curve of chin and cheek ; while the smallest action , as of lifting a cup to her lips , became a veritable joy to behold .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 32]: She was the incarnation of grace , and , looking at her , Mollie became uncomfortably aware of roughened hair , sunburnt hands , and a dozen little deficiencies of toilette .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 37]: Even Ruth suffered from the comparison , and , despite an obvious effort to sustain her role as hostess , there was a strained , unhappy expression upon her face which went to Mollie 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 42]: It was a relief to all when Lady Margot rose to take leave ; but when she offered her hand to Victor in his turn , he said eagerly -- `` May n't I walk down with you to the vicarage ?
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: It is so long since we met !
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 9]: Please let me take you so far ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 13]: `` Oh , certainly , if you can spare the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 20]: replied Lady Margot with a careless indifference of manner which made her consent almost more blighting than a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 21]: Victor winced beneath it , but made no comment , and the two tall figures walked slowly down the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 23]: Immediately they had disappeared , Jack summoned a servant to wheel him into the house , and the girls were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 57]: They sat silently for a long time , as true friends can do without offence , Ruth gazing ahead with grey eyes which saw nothing of the beauty of the scene ; Mollie glancing from time to time at her troubled face , then turning quickly aside , lest her scrutiny might be observed and resented .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 35]: At length Ruth spoke , letting her figure drop back in her chair with a gesture of weariness -- `` I wonder how it is that nothing is ever as nice as one expects ?
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 34]: If we could have looked forward two months ago , and seen ourselves as we are now , we should have imagined ourselves the happiest creatures on earth ; but I am not .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 20]: Sometimes it seems quite perfect for a few moments , but something always happens to rub off the bloom .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 16]: Uncle Bernard is cross , or Mrs Wolff stupid , or -- or something else !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 14]: I believe we are not meant to be happy in this world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 10]: Mollie looked up with a quick flush of dissent .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 12]: `` Oh , I think that is such a grudging idea !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 33]: I hate to hear people say it , and I ca n't think how they can , when they look round , and see how bright and beautiful everything has been made !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 42]: If God had meant us to be dull and sad , would He have made all the flowers different colours , and every season different from the last , and the sunsets and the dawn , and the wonderful changing clouds ?
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 48]: It is just a gorgeous feast to delight our eyes of colour ; and all the animals are so cheerful , while they are young , at least -- they skip and dance by instinct , so surely we must be meant to be happy too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' Ruth objected slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 18]: `` Animals have not souls and responsibilities , but we have , and that keeps us serious .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 16]: The average man and woman is not happy , if you can judge by appearances .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 31]: I remember reading about a man who walked about the streets of London all day long to see how many people he should meet with a smile on their faces .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 17]: I forget how many there were -- half a dozen , perhaps -- terribly few ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 20]: `` Well , there would have been thousands , if people were half as grateful as they should be .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 58]: Do you know , I sometimes think that what must grieve God more than almost anything else is that so many people refuse to be happy , in spite of all He can do , and go on forgetting their blessings , and making themselves miserable about little bits of silly worries and bothers day after day .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 20]: Imagine if you had a child who was always grizzling , in spite of all your love and care !
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 6]: How would you feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 8]: `` But a child is a child .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 9]: We may be meant to be serious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 9]: `` You can be serious without being glum .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: You can be happy without being thoughtless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 44]: `` Ah , Mollie dear , '' cried Ruth , turning to her sister and holding out her hand with a rush of tenderness -- `` ah , Mollie dear , happiness is a gift , which you possess and I do not !
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 14]: I am sad even on this lovely day , in this lovely place .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 22]: It may be wrong , but I ca n't help it , yet I do n't think I am ungrateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 28]: `` You are happy enough as a rule ; but you do ` sup sorrow with a spoon ' when you get the chance , old dear !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 46]: An hour ago , for instance , the sky seemed remarkably bright , and I could make a shrewd guess at the reason of this cloud ; but , if I did , I expect you would snap off my head for my pains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 18]: `` Yes , I should -- I certainly should ; so be careful what you say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 4]: cried Ruth hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 21]: Then , as if eager to change the subject -- `` Here is James coming out with the afternoon letters .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 8]: I hope there is one from home .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 8]: It seems ages since we heard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 3]: `` Trix !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 3]: For me .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 3]: How lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 7]: I 'll read it aloud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 26]: cried Mollie , tearing open the envelope , and unfolding several odd sheets torn out of an exercise-book and covered with large , untidy handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 34]: Trix 's characteristic epistles were always welcome , and this afternoon 's specimen had arrived in the very nick of time to stop an embarrassing discussion , and cheer Ruth 's drooping spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 57]: Mollie lay back in her chair , and began reading in her clear fresh tones -- `` Darling Moll , -- While you are basking in the lap of luxury , this poor critter is snatching a few precious moments from ` prep ' to answer your last epistle , and give what news there is .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 44]: First and foremost , mother is as well as possible , and goes about with an ` open your mouth and shut your eyes , and in your mouth you 'll find a prize ' expression , which puzzles her friends into fits .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 18]: Poor mum simply dies to tell them that one of her daughters will shortly become a millionaire !
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 31]: But she shuts her lips up tight , and looks more mysterious than ever , because , of course , there is a chance that it may not come off .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 18]: Do n't let me ever see your faces again if it does n't , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 9]: `` Fancy you having all those fine clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 11]: I ca n't imagine how you would look respectably attired .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: Kindly remember Beatrice Olivia for any cast-off fineries .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 4]: Hair-ribbons especially desired .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 15]: I 've nothing left but an old Navy-blue , twisted up like a tape .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: `` We had a general intelligence examination at school this week .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 4]: Stupid old things !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 14]: One question was , ` What is the complementary colour to red ? '
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 37]: I had never heard of a complementary colour in my life , and I was just racking my brains to think what to say , when my eyes happened to light on Miss Smith 's carrots .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 15]: ` Ah , ha , ' thinks I , ` I have it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 39]: So I put down ` auburn , ' and was jolly well pleased with myself until lunch-time came , when I was telling Gladys my answers , and Miss Bateson heard me , and went into perfect fits !
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 20]: It seems complementary means something idiotic about two colours making a white light -- as if they ever could !
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 16]: Anyway , I think my answer was very pretty and tactful -- do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 11]: and I hope it will soften Smithy 's hard heart .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 29]: `` Another silly question was , ` Order a dinner for a class of twelve Board-school children , and state what quantities of each article are required . '
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 30]: One girl ordered a pound of roast beef and a pound of potatoes for each child , and ten and a half yards of Swiss-roll for the whole class !
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: I ordered the ` scrag-end of the neck . '
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 16]: Have n't the least idea what it means , but I thought it sounded cheap .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 9]: I likewise gave them suet dumplings for pudding .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 5]: Hope they liked them !
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 9]: `` Is Mr Melland 's ankle getting better ?
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 17]: Have you had any more callers , invitations , rides , excursions , or excitements generally ?
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 18]: Please answer my questions next time , and do n't ignore them , as you generally do .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 7]: Drummond had a fine adventure yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 24]: Another small boy dared him to stick his head between our railings , and he did , but it would n't come out !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 31]: He pushed , and the small boy pulled , and a crowd collected right across the pavement , making kind suggestions , and commenting on the size of his ears .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 19]: Whenever he tried to get back , the railings caught them , and they stuck out like sails .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 39]: Finally his pride gave way , and he howled , and a friendly policeman coming along , poked the rails apart with a stick , or did something or other , and out he came with a rush .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 22]: He looked very crushed in every sense all the evening , so we hope it may be a lesson to him .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 21]: `` The next-door girls have new hats -- mustard straw , draped with green , and roses under the brim .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 17]: It seems so sad to reflect that the poor dears probably imagine they look quite nice !
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 6]: `` How is the Ogre ?
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 14]: Does he still live in his den , and growl when you appear ?
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 19]: I should be very glad he did shut himself up , when he is so cross and disagreeable !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 8]: `` Well , ta-ta , my darlings !
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 37]: I miss you at home , but I ca n't say I pine for your return , for it 's quite pleasant to be Number One for a change , and boss Attica and the Muz .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 15]: Take care of yourselves , behave prettily , and do n't forget the hair-ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 6]: -- Your loving Trix . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 5]: `` Wild child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 5]: said Ruth , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 9]: `` She does write the most absurd letters !
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 19]: Better tear that up at once , Mollie , or burn it when you get into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 16]: You have such a trick of leaving things about , and it is n't safe .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 53]: Uncle Bernard might -- '' She started violently , and Mollie jumped to her feet as a harsh voice interrupted the sentence -- `` Uncle Bernard has already had the pleasure of hearing the way in which a member of your family writes of him to a visitor in his own house .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 37]: Ideas of loyalty seem to have altered since my young days , when it was considered a breach of decent feeling to eat a man 's salt and speak slightingly of him behind his back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 33]: Ruth sat silent , crimson to the roots of her hair ; Mollie shuffled miserably from one foot to another , but did not shrink from the old man 's angry gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 10]: `` But how did you hear , Uncle Bernard ?
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 20]: Have you been sitting behind this open window , listening to us all the while we have been talking ?
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 13]: I do n't think it is quite fair to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 7]: `` Do n't you , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 19]: I happened to be reading in my armchair , when you came and planted your chairs immediately outside .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 38]: I was the first - comer , you observe , not yourselves , and I can not say I was interested enough to listen to your conversation until my attention was attracted by the description of myself .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 12]: I presume the very descriptive title was originally your invention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 16]: He planted his stick on the ground , and stared fixedly in Mollie 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 23]: The grey eyes fell before his , and she answered hesitatingly -- `` I 'm -- I 'm afraid it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 20]: `` And do you think it was good manners to write in such a way of your host ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 13]: `` No , I do n't ; I think it was hateful .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 7]: But -- '' `` But ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 15]: Mollie took a step forward , and laid a timid hand on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 13]: `` But , in a sort of way , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 23]: You shut yourself up , and you do growl , and even when you are kind , you pretend to be cross .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 18]: We have tried and tried to be friends with you , but you wo n't let us .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 29]: We have said over and over again that we felt as if we were living in an hotel , and it has been a trouble to us all .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 24]: I do n't wonder you feel angry ; but do n't you think you are a wee bit in the wrong yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 41]: Mr Farrell stared down at the eager face , the wide grey eyes , the little hand upon his arm , then deliberately drew himself away , saying coldly -- `` You would make a good lawyer , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 20]: You have a clever trick of evading an awkward question , and shifting the blame from your own shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 24]: You will excuse me if I say that I can scarcely consent to discuss my own conduct with a girl of your years .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 16]: The point I mentioned was your own conduct in writing disrespectfully of your host . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 24]: `` I know , and I 've said already that it was horrid ; but it was not so horrid as you think .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 22]: Trix is my sister , and we all have a habit of exaggerating and using stronger terms than we really mean .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 10]: We have a habit of giving nicknames , too .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 17]: They are not complimentary as a rule , but we do n't mean to be unkind .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 21]: If you read some of Trix 's other letters , you would see that we have not been altogether ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: Will you read them ?
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 16]: I have them all upstairs , and could bring them down in a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 6]: `` You are very good .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 18]: Judging from the specimen I have heard , I think I would rather decline the honour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but you ought not to decline !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 20]: It is n't a question of enjoyment ; it 's a question of justice to Ruth and to me .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 20]: You accuse us of being disloyal and ungrateful , so it 's only fair you should hear our defence .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 16]: I will bring down the letters , and you can read them at your leisure .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 31]: They may bore you a little , but you will see that we are not so bad as you think , and that we have not always been uncomplimentary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: She walked hastily towards the house , leaving Ruth and the old man alone .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 32]: He stood leaning on his stick , staring fixedly at her with his sunken eyes ; but her head remained persistently drooped , the dark lashes lying on the flushed cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 28]: In the tension of that silence she could hear the beating of her own heart , and her ears strained nervously for the sound of returning footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 7]: She had not long to wait .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 19]: With a clatter , Mollie came scrambling out of the library window , the letters in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 6]: `` There 's our defence !
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 11]: Please read them before you scold us any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 23]: Mr Farrell took the letters , thrust them into his pocket , then stood silently , as if waiting for something more .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 27]: Mollie stared at him curiously , but he paid no attention to her ; his gaze was fixed on Ruth 's bent figure and downcast face .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 26]: At length , surprised at the prolonged silence , she lifted her eyes with a frightened glance , and immediately Uncle Bernard broke into speech .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 9]: `` Yes , I was waiting for you !
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 11]: Have you nothing to say on your own account ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: he demanded sternly .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 15]: `` You seem content to sit silently and let your sister fight your battles .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 16]: Is it because you are innocent of having offended in the same way yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 10]: Ruth 's cheeks flushed to an even deeper rose .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 14]: `` I , '' she stammered -- `` I -- I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 14]: I did n't mean -- '' Mr Farrell turned to re-enter the house .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 17]: `` Ah , '' he said coldly , '' so it was cowardice , after all !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 3]: I understand .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 7]: It is an interesting discovery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 5]: RECEIVING AND PAYING CALLS .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 17]: Two days later Mr Farrell returned Trix 's letters with a brief `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 10]: which Mollie had enough tact to receive without remark .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 25]: She was not conscious of having gained in the old man 's graces , though Ruth was sadly conscious of having fallen from favour .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 27]: Victor was evidently for the time being the _ persona grata _ , his remarks being received with attention , and his wishes carefully carried out .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 30]: Mollie confessed to herself that Victor 's manners were perfect where his host was concerned , and wondered why it was that she found herself constantly suspecting his motives .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 15]: What if he were playing a part to win the old man 's favour ?
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 23]: Was it not the unhappy feature of the situation that they were all , more or less , doing the same thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 6]: Meantime , callers arrived daily .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 37]: Stout , middle-aged matrons , with pompous manners ; thin matrons , precise and formal of speech ; tall elegants , with flowing robes and Parisian millinery ; sporting-looking women , with short skirts and motor-caps .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 37]: One after another they drove up to the door and sat for a few moments in the drawing-room , going through the same stereotyped conversation : `` How pleasant to have the Court opened once more !
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 6]: How do you like Raby ?
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 10]: How delightful to have such delightful summer-like weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 24]: Then they drank a cup of tea , nibbled a piece of cake , and said : '' _ Good _ - afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 9]: _ So _ pleased to have met you !
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 13]: We shall hope to see you again _ very _ soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 48]: Occasionally the matron brought a daughter in her train , and still more occasionally a shy , depressed-looking husband ; but at the best of times the calls were not cheerful occasions , and Ruth and Mollie looked forward with little pleasure to paying their return visits .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 31]: `` Though it must at least be more interesting than receiving at home , for we shall see other people 's houses , and the way they arrange their drawing-rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 8]: I do love studying strange drawing-rooms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 4]: said Ruth meditatively .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 17]: `` In country houses they ought to be charming -- all chintzy and smelling of pot-pourri !
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 13]: All the same , Mollie , I 'm disappointed in the neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 12]: They are n't a bit thrilling , as we expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 8]: `` People generally seem uninteresting at first .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 15]: They may turn out to be perfect darlings , when we know them better .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 37]: I dare say they drove away saying the same thing of us , for we behaved like a couple of marionettes , sitting dressed up in our best , saying , ` Yes , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 6]: ` No , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 7]: ` Very much , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: ` Thank you so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: as if we were wound up by machinery .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 15]: We must really launch out , and say something a trifle more original ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 17]: It was quite an exciting occasion when the girls set out on their first calling expedition .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 31]: It was an ideal May afternoon , and the prospect of driving over the countryside in an open carriage , behind two prancing horses , was in itself a delight .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 42]: Victor was to make one of the party , but Jack refused contemptuously to accompany them if only for the drive , declaring that even a sprained ankle had its silver lining if it let him off so boring a function .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 42]: He was sitting in the hall , waiting to cheer -- or more strictly speaking , to jeer -- the departure , when Ruth came downstairs buttoning her gloves , and , to her surprise , Mr Farrell was also present .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 16]: Both men looked up critically as she appeared , but neither glance was altogether approving .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 23]: Her new dress looked too old and staid for so young a girl ; moreover , her expression was fretful and worried .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 25]: As she reached the spot where the two men were seated , Victor came into the hall from the doorway and looked round impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: `` Are you ready , Miss Ruth ?
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 11]: The carriage has been waiting for some time now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 10]: `` Oh , I have been ready for ages !
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 8]: It 's Mollie who is the laggard .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 13]: She has been dressing ever since lunch , and is dressing still .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 11]: I do n't know when she will be finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 8]: Mr Farrell turned imperiously to the butler .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 21]: `` Be kind enough to send a message to Miss Mary that I object to having the horses kept waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 15]: Three o'clock was the hour arranged , and it is already a quarter past .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 9]: Ask how soon she will be ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 30]: The man departed , and there was an uncomfortable silence for several minutes , broken at last by the banging of a door and the sound of racing footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 33]: A white-and-blue vision came flying down the staircase , with filmy skirts floating behind , white feathers drooping over the golden hair , a cobweb parasol unfurled , and held triumphantly aloft .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 29]: It took such ages to fasten , and I had to take my hair down and do it up again to get the hat at the right angle .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 18]: I wanted to fasten my gloves , to give you the whole effect , parasol and all .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 20]: Mollie strutted to and fro , turning her head from side to side like a sleek , self-satisfied pigeon .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 7]: `` How do you like it ?
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 11]: Do n't you think I look rather -- nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 20]: The two young men laughed aloud , and Mr Farrell said drily -- `` Fine feathers make fine birds !
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 19]: I am glad to see that you have honoured my friends by wearing your fineries for their benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 14]: Ruth , I presume , prefers to keep hers for another occasion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 9]: Ruth dropped her eyelids and vouchsafed no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 24]: There was a little lump in her throat at that moment which would have made it difficult to speak in her usual voice .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 32]: It was hard to have denied herself for naught , and less than naught , for Mollie 's extravagance seemed more to the old man 's taste than her own prudence .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 31]: It was not the first time that the difference in their attire had been the subject of little edged remarks , which had made her bitterly regret the lost opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 44]: Seated in the carriage opposite Victor , she was still further depressed by the fear that he was also comparing her with Mollie , to her own disadvantage ; but there was no hint of such a thought in his look or manner .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 9]: The dark eyes met hers with sympathetic understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 21]: At every point he deferred to her opinion with a subtle flattery which was inexpressibly soothing to her wounded feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 49]: The occupants of the first house on the list were not at home , so a sheaf of cards were left , and the carriage sped on another mile to Number 2 , where the family were discovered superintending the arrangements of bedding-out plants round the front lawn .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 45]: They greeted the visitors with easy cordiality , consulted them on the knotty question of geraniums _ versus _ begonias , escorted them round the gardens , and were vociferously reproachful when they refused to stay another half - hour to partake of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 81]: As the carriage drove up the drive leading to the third house , a masculine figure was seen rushing to conceal itself behind the bushes , and the visitors had hard work to conceal their smiles when their hostess sent an urgent message to summon her husband from the grounds , and , on hearing that he could not be found , expressed her conviction that he would be woefully disappointed to have missed the pleasure of making their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 8]: `` A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind !
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 25]: I do n't feel a bit of a grudge against that fellow , '' Victor said laughingly , as they drove off once more .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 26]: `` With your permission , I am going to follow his example and make a bolt of it when we get back to the high-road .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 14]: I shall enjoy the walk home , after being cramped up all afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 10]: You will excuse me , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: `` But we are going to the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 9]: That 's the next house on the list .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 10]: Do n't you want to see Lady Margot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 7]: cried Mollie , outspoken as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 22]: Both girls stared at him in amazement , but there was no sign of embarrassment on the handsome , smiling face .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 23]: `` Very much , of course , but not enough to face another drawing-room catechism , accompanied by draughts of strong tea .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 26]: There will be no escape this time , so you must be generous , and let me run for it , like poor Mr Granger !
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 21]: I have been very good and docile , but if you only knew how I am longing for freedom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 23]: There was no gainsaying such a request , nor , indeed , did either of the girls particularly wish to do so .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 24]: They made no objections , therefore , but , putting Victor down at the cross-roads , drove on their way in great good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 18]: The Moat was a picturesque old house , though by no means so imposing as the Court .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 43]: The man-servant reported that Mrs Blount was not well enough to receive visitors , but that Lady Margot was at home and disengaged ; and the visitors were shown into a pleasant , sunny apartment , where Margot herself was seated reading .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 40]: She looked up apprehensively at the sound of the opening door ; but at the sight of the two girls her expression changed , and she came forward to greet them with an eagerness which could not be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 11]: `` This is good of you to come so soon !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 16]: And I am alone , so we can have a delightful chat all to ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 7]: Bring tea , Wilson , please .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 13]: Do come and sit down , and let me make you comfortable !
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 26]: My aunt is not downstairs to-day , and I was getting so bored with my own society that I am doubly pleased to see you !
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 26]: There are so few girls of my own age in this neighbourhood that I find it rather dull after the rush and bustle of town .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 17]: It is so good of you to be here at the same time as me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 32]: `` It is very nice for us , '' responded Mollie brightly ; while truthful Ruth hesitated to find some reply which would be at once polite and non - committal .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 27]: `` But is n't it a strange time for you to come to this quiet place , when London is at its brightest and gayest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 9]: `` Ah , thereby hang many tales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 6]: cried Lady Margot , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 34]: `` The most important is , perhaps , that I am not strong enough to go through a season just now ; but I have no intention of being dull even in Raby .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 14]: We must amuse each other and do all kinds of nice things together .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 37]: The great lack on my visits , so far , has been to find any other girls with whom I could be intimate ; but now that you are here it will be quite different . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 10]: `` But we are only country-cousins , Lady Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 18]: You will find that we are very ignorant of the things that have made up your life .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 46]: We are very poor at home , and have had to do most of our gaieties in imagination , '' said Ruth ; while Mollie gave a little gurgle of laughter , and cried -- `` Let 's tell her about Berengaria and Lucille ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 40]: Lady Margot looked her curiosity , and , when the nature of the game was explained in detail in Mollie 's breezy language , went into peals of delighted laughter , and rocked to and fro in her chair .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 9]: `` How lovely -- oh , how lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 8]: I do think it is too funny !
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 8]: I must call you Berengaria and Lucille .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 4]: Do you mind ?
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 4]: Such wonderful names !
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 9]: How did you manage to hit on them ?
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 16]: I used to imagine , too ; and what do you think was my dream ?
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 39]: Instead of being a lonely only girl , I was a large family of grown-up sisters , and schoolboys coming home for the holidays , and little dots in the nursery -- all in my own little self .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 15]: You ca n't imagine how dull it is to be an only girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 8]: `` No , '' asserted Ruth doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 12]: `` But rather nice to get all the petting and consideration !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 26]: When you are the eldest of seven children , you are always expected to set an example , and it is very wearing at times .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 15]: How delightful that you amused yourself ` pretending , ' just as we did !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 11]: That makes quite a bond of union between us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 20]: But lucky creatures , your dream seems about to come true , while I am as lonely as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 9]: Your position at the Court is so romantic !
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 24]: You do n't mind my speaking about it , do you , because everyone knows , and is so interested in the result ?
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 25]: Of course , one of you must be the lucky heir ; and then we shall be neighbours , and see each other constantly .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 12]: Which is it to be -- Berengaria , or Lucille ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 4]: `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 3]: said Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 4]: `` Ruth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 3]: said Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 9]: `` Do n't believe her , Lady Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 22]: She is a wee bit out of favour the last few days , but I have n't a chance beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 20]: She has the Farrell eyebrows , you see , and the Farrell frown , and poise of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 22]: When she is sitting in the dining-room , you could tell at once that she was a descendant of the oil-paintings .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 29]: I often see Uncle Bernard looking from her to them , and he is far more amiable to her than to any of us , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 14]: We all agree that she is far and away the chief favourite . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 3]: `` Really !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 13]: You discuss it among yourselves , and come to the same conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 4]: How interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 4]: said Lady Margot .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: `` And the two men -- your cousins -- do they have no chance at all , poor things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 4]: she asked lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 7]: `` They are not our cousins .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 20]: They belong to different sides of the house , and we had never met till we came down here .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 22]: Mr Melland refuses to be considered as a ` candidate , ' and is staying only till his ankle is better .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 18]: Mr Druce , '' -- Ruth hesitated uncertainly -- `` he is very nice to Uncle Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 7]: They talk together a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 10]: Sometimes I think his chance is very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 21]: `` He is certainly second favourite , so far ; but we have more than two months still before us .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 11]: I intend to cut them both out long before then .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 10]: May I have one of those dear little scones ?
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 9]: I am quite hungry after my drive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 15]: Mollie said , as she in turn was presented with a dainty Worcester cup .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 26]: She watched Lady Margot with intent eyes , as she flitted about the room , placing little tables beside her guests for their greater convenience .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 40]: `` Such a plain dress , and almost no jewellery , and her hair so simply done ; but she looks a Lucille through and through , as I should never do , however fine I might be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 6]: she said admiringly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 16]: `` We must think what we shall do to amuse ourselves , must n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 25]: You have begun your round of dinners already , I hear ; but in Raby they are apt to be a trifle too agricultural .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 34]: All the men talk about their crops at this time of the year , and , as the prospects are generally bad , they get gloomier and gloomier as each course comes on .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 32]: Mr Druce told me that Mr Early has paid you a visitation , so , if you take his conversation as a sample , you can judge of the combined effect .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 14]: I do n't ask what he talked about , because I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' murmured Ruth vaguely , while her eye met Mollie 's in an involuntary appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 7]: `` Mr Druce told me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 26]: -- But Mr Early 's call had taken place only three days before , nearly a week after Lady Margot 's visit to the Court .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 7]: `` Mr Druce told me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 35]: That meant that Margot had met Victor yesterday or the day before , and had talked with him some time , for the prosy Mr Early would not be an early subject of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 25]: Victor often went out riding alone , and there was no reason in the world why he should not call on an old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 18]: But why make a mystery of it , and avoid the call to-day by an obvious subterfuge ?
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 26]: Ruth was very quiet for the rest of the visit , and Lady Margot glanced at her more than once as she chatted with Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 16]: When tea was over she came out to the porch to watch their departure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 15]: _ Au revoir _ , Berengaria -- _ au revoir _ , Lucille ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 34]: she cried gaily , as the carriage drove away ; but as she turned from the door , the smile faded from her face , and was replaced by a very thoughtful expression .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 9]: `` I see -- I see it all !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 5]: Poor pretty thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 6]: she said tenderly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 13]: `` I am sorry for her and for poor Margot , too !
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 15]: Which of us , I wonder , is the more to be pitied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 5]: PREPARING FOR THE GARDEN-PARTY .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 23]: Mrs Thornton took counsel with her husband as to the best form of hospitality she could show to the squire 's visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 14]: `` I want to be one of the first to entertain them formally .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 12]: It is a duty in our position , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 37]: `` The girls have been to tea several times , and that dear Mollie runs up to the nursery as naturally as if she were at home ; but I think we ought to do more .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 20]: The squire will expect it ; and then the question is , dear -- what can we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 5]: `` Just so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 10]: The vicar smiled , half amused , half quizzical .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 10]: `` The means at our disposal are distinctly limited .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 22]: We ca n't ask them to dinner , because the staff is incapable of cooking and serving an extensive meal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 28]: `` And there are only three sherry-glasses left , and Mary broke the round glass dish last week -- the one I always used for the trifle .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 15]: And the dinner-service ... We really must buy a new dinner-service , Stanford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 10]: `` We really must , Agnes -- some time !
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 15]: I think all the objections taken together put the dinner-party out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 13]: Would not a somewhat more formal tea -- '' `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 7]: Mrs Thornton shook her head decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 11]: `` A formal tea is the most depressing function imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 14]: If it was a little later on , I would suggest a hay-party .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 20]: As it is , I am afraid it must be a garden - party , pure and simple . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 4]: The vicar laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 8]: `` Simple , it certainly would be .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 16]: Our poor little lawn , one tennis-court , and the flower-garden a mass of weeds !
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 18]: We ca n't afford a band of minstrels , or even the ordinary ices and hothouse fruits .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 13]: I am afraid it might be rather a failure , Agnes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 8]: But Mrs Thornton refused to be discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 5]: `` Nonsense , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 10]: People do n't expect extravagant entertainments at a vicarage !
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 23]: The children and I can undertake the weeding , and when that is done the dear old herbaceous borders will look charming !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 53]: The lawn is not big , but there is delightful shade beneath the beech-trees , and we can draw the piano up to the drawing-room window , and get a few people to sing for us -- Maud Bailey and Mrs Reed ; and I believe Mr Druce has a fine voice .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 15]: I 'll ask him to be very kind , and give us a song .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 32]: As for refreshments , I can give good tea and coffee , and the best cream for miles around , and people can exist without ices for once in a way .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 13]: Given a bright , fine day , I could manage beautifully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 8]: `` I have no doubt you could .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 25]: But why go through the ceremony of asking my advice , Mistress Thornton , when your mind has been made up from the beginning ?
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 8]: Go your ways -- go your ways !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 9]: I wash my hands of all responsibility ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 41]: cried the vicar , laughing , as he walked back to his study , leaving his wife to sit down to her desk and make out a lengthy list of guests , which included everyone of note for miles round .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 63]: During the days to come Mr Thornton often sympathised with his wife on the amount of work she had undertaken in order to entertain the squire 's guests ; but , even to his unobservant eyes , it was apparent that , so far from being exhausted , she throve beneath it , and appeared brighter and younger than for years past .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 45]: All work and no play has an even more depressing effect upon Jill than on Jack , and Mrs Thornton was by instinct a hospitable creature , who would have loved nothing better than a houseful of guests and a constant succession of entertainments .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 51]: With small means , a large family , and a straggling parish , her time and energy were for the most part engrossed in sheer hard work , so that the prospect of a little `` jollification , '' as she laughingly expressed it , came as a welcome variety .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 35]: The invitations to the Court were sent out first , to make sure of the most important guests , and down came the girls with notes of acceptance , and a hundred curious questions .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 5]: `` Who is coming ?
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 7]: What are you going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 6]: What dresses shall we wear ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 5]: Can we help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 53]: they asked eagerly ; whereupon Mrs Thornton laughed , and replied hesitatingly -- `` It is most incorrect ; you ought to know nothing of the make-shifts , but just drive down to enjoy the completed effect ; but , yes , -- I can not resist the pleasure of your company .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 17]: Come , if you like , and I 'll promise you some real hard work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 13]: `` That 's right ; and you 'll find us so useful !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 31]: We have been born and brought up on make-shifts , and can make anything out of nothing , and a box of tacks -- ca n't we , Ruth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 19]: cried Mollie , in the brutally outspoken manner which always brought a flush into her sister 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 37]: It was not so much foolish shame at the fact of poverty , but the stab of painful repugnance which came with the remembrance of the bareness and lack of beauty which characterised the old life .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 31]: After a month 's sojourn at the Court the day of small things seemed far away , and she shrank at the possibility of returning to it as a permanency .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 41]: When Mrs Thornton began to enumerate her difficulties , and escorted the girls from one room to another to ask their advice upon various knotty points , it was like the probing of a wound to Ruth 's sensitive nerves .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 17]: The house itself was roomy and well built , but in a hopeless state of disrepair .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 33]: The paint was worn and dingy ; the wallpapers so old - fashioned and discoloured that all Mrs Thornton 's painstaking efforts after cheerfulness and beauty were foiled by the inartistic background .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 26]: `` I shed tears over the drawing-room paper when I was first married , '' said Mrs Thornton , with a laugh and a shrug .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 25]: `` But , as one gets older , there are so many more serious things to cry over that one learns to be philosophical .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 36]: I thought I might put some big , spreading branches in these old pots to cover the walls as much as possible , for we must have some rooms available in case of a shower .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 19]: A wet day is too terrible a catastrophe to contemplate , so we wo n't even imagine it .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: Given sunshine and unlimited borrowing , we can struggle through .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 22]: Think of it , my dears -- I have invited over a hundred people , and we possess twelve teaspoons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 11]: Mollie gurgled with laughter in her hearty , infectious manner .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 14]: `` I 'd give up sugar for the day , and do without .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 7]: That 's one off the list .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 11]: Shall we ask the butler to send down a supply ?
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 14]: I 'm sure he has hundreds stowed away in those great plate-chests . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 6]: `` My dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 8]: I should not think of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 6]: cried Mrs Thornton , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 11]: `` I can manage quite well without troubling the squire .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 12]: Pray do n't repeat any of my thoughtless remarks to him .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 15]: My husband says that my tongue runs away with me far too often . ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 17]: Ruth protested politely , but Mollie preserved an unusual silence for the rest of the visit .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 33]: She was evidently thinking hard , and the result of her cogitations was , that when she returned to the Court she paid a surprise visit to Mr Farrell in his sanctum .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 33]: The old man was sitting reading in his favourite chair , and as he looked up it struck Mollie that he looked more alert than she had seen him since her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 17]: The voice in which he answered her greeting was certainly less wearied and fretful than usual .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 17]: He looked , if such a miracle could be believed , almost pleased to see her .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 13]: `` Well , -- so you have returned from your wanderings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 13]: `` Yes , here I am , come to bother you again .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 25]: There 's a whole half-hour before you need begin to dress , and I 've something very important to talk to you about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 8]: `` What does that mean , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 4]: More new dresses ?
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 21]: I should have thought you could hardly have come to the end of the last supply by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 5]: `` Goodness , no !
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 6]: They will last for years .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 8]: It is something far more important . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 35]: Mollie seated herself on a low chair directly opposite the old man , leant her elbows on her knees , her chin on her hands , and said hesitatingly -- `` Uncle Bernard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 4]: `` Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 20]: `` Do you remember the first evening we were here , when you spoke to us about our visit ?
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 27]: You said that you might possibly allow each of us in turn to act as master or mistress of the ceremonies for a short time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 11]: `` I believe I did say something of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 13]: It occurred to me that it might be an interesting experiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 36]: `` And did you mean that we could really do what we liked , about money and everything else , just as if we were really and truly the real owner in your place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 6]: Mr Farrell smiled somewhat grimly .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 16]: `` If your sister asked me that question , I should say ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 16]: Knowing as I do your capacity for extravagance , I am a little more cautious .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 15]: Within reasonable limits that is , however , what I meant to imply . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 4]: sighed Mollie deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 11]: `` But it all depends on what you call reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 21]: At any rate , you can only refuse , and things can be no worse than they are at present .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 14]: Please , Uncle Bernard , may I begin my reign from to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 4]: `` Your reign !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 19]: You put it forcibly , my dear -- more so than is perhaps quite pleasant in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 18]: And you are the youngest of the four ; your turn should come last , not first .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 41]: When the others have had their trial -- '' `` But they have never asked for it ; they do n't want it , and I do ; and you said nothing about taking turns when you made the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 14]: If you let me begin , they could take warning from my mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 12]: I do n't think you would find they disliked the arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 13]: Do , please , be kind and say ` Yes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 15]: Mr Farrell reflected for a moment , bringing the tips of his fingers together .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: `` As you say , you are the first to express any desire to take me at my word .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 21]: If it pleases you to assume the reins of government for a short time , I have no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 6]: `` You mean it really ?
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 14]: I can begin at once , and give what orders I like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 20]: `` Subject , as I have said , to some possible restrictions if your enthusiasm carries you too far .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 11]: There is evidently some big scheme looming behind this request .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 11]: You had better let me know the worst at once .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 9]: What is to be your first extravagance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 12]: Mollie 's head still rested in the cup of her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 17]: She looked at him steadily , with a little flame of determination in her grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 16]: `` I am going to have the vicarage painted and papered from top to bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 5]: It 's disgracefully shabby !
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 33]: The paper is hanging off the walls in some places , and where it is n't , it would be almost better if it were , it is so ugly and worn .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 41]: It is too bad to expect Mr and Mrs Thornton to do all the hard , depressing work of the parish and keep bright and cheerful themselves , when their home is enough to give the blues to a clown !
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 14]: It looks as if it had n't been touched for a century ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 21]: Mr Farrell lowered his eyelids and sat in a grim silence , while the clock ticked a full two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 34]: Mollie , watching his face , saw the thin lips grow thinner and thinner , as they were pressed the more firmly together ; the horizontal lines in his forehead deepened into furrows .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 25]: There was no mistaking the fact that he was displeased , and deeply displeased , even before the cold eyes met hers once more .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 24]: `` I had no intention now , or at any other time , of allowing you to assume control over the whole parish !
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 12]: My proposition referred simply to this house and your own entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 12]: I am still capable of looking after my own property . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 11]: `` But -- '' began Mollie , and stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 40]: Even her courage failed before the obvious retort that the property was not looked after , but allowed to fall into dilapidation ; but Mr Farrell understood without the need of words , and his eyes flashed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 10]: `` You must permit me to judge for myself !
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 37]: When my day is over , whoever comes into possession can squander my money as he or she sees fit , but I can not hurry the time forward , however much you may desire it .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 7]: You must be patient and wait .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 9]: It may come sooner than you think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 14]: Mollie sprang to her feet with an exclamation of mingled pain and anger .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 9]: `` Oh , Uncle Bernard , how cruel !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 10]: How can you say anything so horrid and unjust !
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 20]: It is n't true , and you know it is n't true , and I do n't deserve it !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 10]: I only asked for what you yourself suggested . ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 24]: `` I never suggested that you should interfere with my property , and criticise what I had chosen to do or left undone .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 29]: As for not deserving reproach , you must have made very sure of stepping into my shoes since you wish to wear them while I am still here .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 25]: No doubt I appear to you a mere cumberer of the ground ; but it is my ground , I would have you remember .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 11]: You can not take liberties with it yet awhile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 7]: `` I do n't want it !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 5]: I never want it !
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 6]: I 'll go home to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 11]: You have no right to taunt me like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 25]: cried Mollie , trembling with such a storm of indignation and wounded feeling as she had rarely known in her bright , easy-going existence .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 40]: A rush of ugly words came to her lips , and struggled for utterance , while Mr Farrell sank back in his chair , and lay crouched against the cushions , one thin hand pressed heavily over his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 16]: The look , the action , brought Mollie to herself with a stab of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 27]: Whatever he had said to wound her pride , she had no right to forget his weakness , his danger , his lonely , piteous age .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 15]: Anger died a rapid death , and gave place to an even keener sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 25]: When Mr Farrell looked up again , it was to find the grey eyes wet with tears , and the lips trembling with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 13]: `` Oh , you poor old man -- you poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 8]: Why will you make it so difficult ?
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 18]: Why wo n't you let us love you and be a comfort , instead of a trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 9]: We would , if you would allow us .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 18]: We want to , but you keep us at arm 's length , and scold and sneer .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 7]: I am not thinking of myself .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 17]: I am young and strong , and I have my home and my dear little mother .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 8]: I shall be happy , whatever happens .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 10]: It 's _ you _ I am sorry for !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: I hate to see you ill and lonely .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 21]: You have given a great deal to me ; ca n't you be generous enough to take something in return ?
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 7]: There are only two months left .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 7]: The time is nearly half over .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 14]: Ca n't we be friends -- real friends -- until the end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 33]: She drew nearer as she spoke , and saw no rebuff in the watching face , until at last she sank on her knees before him , and timidly touched his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 6]: `` Uncle Bernard , speak !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 6]: Say something to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 21]: Still the old man hesitated ; but his hand lay quietly in hers , and did not try to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 7]: `` What can I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 6]: he asked slowly at last .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 24]: `` I believe you are a good child ; I believe you are honest ; but my days are past for making friendships .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 24]: I have felt deeply in my time , but the power of loving died away with everything else which made life worth living .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 9]: I can not promise what is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 14]: `` But you can at least give me a chance of loving you .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 41]: I wo n't ask any more favours if you will just talk to me a little sometimes , without sneering at me , and let me walk with you about the grounds and be a little bit of a companion .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 3]: Will you ?
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 22]: You might get to like me a little bit in time , and it would not be quite so lonely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 8]: `` I can imagine things less impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 27]: You are a good child ; but remember , Mollie , my liking or not liking has nothing to do with my choice of an heir .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 20]: The condition to which I referred might easily apply to one who appealed to me in no other way .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 9]: It is only right to warn you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: But the listener took no heed of the warning .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 9]: Her face was one radiant beam of delight .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: `` You called me ` Mollie ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 8]: `` It was the very first time !
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 14]: That really does sound as if we were going to be friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 6]: MR. FARRELL MAKES HIS WILL .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 43]: It was not in human nature -- not in Mollie 's nature , at least -- to resist `` showing off '' a little after that momentous interview , and her sudden familiarity with their host filled her companions with amazed curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 38]: Ruth had naturally heard all that had passed , and loyally stifled the dawning of envy , but the young men were at a loss to account for what seemed to them a mysterious change of favourites .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 8]: `` Miss Mollie is outstripping us all !
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 42]: She has stepped into the position of first favourite this last fortnight , '' Victor Druce said , as the four young people sat on the terrace steps waiting for tea , a few days after the visit to the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 32]: He laughed as he spoke , but in a half-hearted manner , and tugged heavily at the ends of his moustache , while he scrutinised Mollie 's face through half-closed lids .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 14]: She beamed at him gaily in response , scorning mock - modest protestations .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 13]: `` Oh yes ; we understand each other ever so much better !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 30]: I have been impressing upon him ever since our first meeting that I am really very nice , and at last he is beginning to realise it for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 6]: He likes me very much .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 20]: He told me so with his very own lips ; but he told me something else , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 10]: May we inquire -- '' `` Oh , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 11]: It is quite as interesting to you as to me .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 29]: Liking has nothing whatever to do with the mysterious condition ; he may quite probably choose the one of us he cares for least , as his heir .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 15]: ` Curiouser and curiouser , ' as Alice said ; is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 16]: There may be a chance for me , after all , '' said Jack lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 13]: Victor knitted his brows , and tugged once more at his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 14]: `` He said so definitely -- you are sure you are not mistaken ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 7]: Then how can one possibly judge ?
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 10]: That upsets all our theories at a blow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 8]: `` That 's what I thought myself .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 28]: I felt sure that it would be Ruth , but now I am all at sea ; but , for my own part , I 'm glad .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 15]: It is easier to be good friends when there is nothing mercenary involved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 23]: Mollie smiled her sunny , candid smile , and lay back in her deck-chair , her hands clasped easily behind her head .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 18]: It was delightful to laze in the sunshine , to feel at peace with all the world .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 42]: The present was so all-absorbing that she had no time to worry her head about the future ; but Ruth sat by her side , with unseeing eyes bent upon her book , while the swift thoughts surged through her brain .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 70]: She also had felt inwardly convinced that Uncle Bernard 's choice would fall upon herself , who was so truly a daughter of his race , and it had been a shock to learn that there was nothing to be deduced from his signs of preference ; but of late days there was another problem which was becoming of even more vital interest than the heirship of the Court .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 19]: Even as she sat there , with averted head , she was acutely conscious of Victor 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 21]: She seemed to know , without looking in his direction , the absorbed , contented expression of the dark face .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 43]: She knew it so well by this time -- knew it in an aspect which no one saw but herself ; for when they were alone together , it was as if a mask fell away , and revealed the true man .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 31]: Then he looked at her with open admiration , spoke unreservedly of himself , and drew her out to tell of her own life , and hopes , and ambitions .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 38]: And there were even more thrilling moments , when the talk ceased , and they sat side by side , silent , yet absorbed , acutely conscious of each other 's presence ; delightfully , inexplicably confused .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 48]: At such moments Ruth confessed to herself that this man , whose very existence she had been unaware of a few weeks before , was fast becoming to her the most important person in the world , and it seemed as certain that he reciprocated her feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 6]: At such moments , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 33]: but certainty died away into uneasy doubt , as upon the approach of a third person -- even the insignificant Mrs Wolff herself -- Victor fell back into his carefully conventional manner .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 13]: It was not that she expected or desired any demonstration in public .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 40]: Ruth was by nature far too reserved to welcome such an exhibition ; but the two attitudes were so widely divided , Victor 's care in keeping them apart so sedulous , that she could not but be perturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 26]: Ruth 's heart had never before been touched ; but love needs no apprenticeship , and she felt by instinct that such self-control was unnatural .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 31]: Surely , surely , if he really `` cared , '' there would be moments when his eyes would involuntarily meet hers , when his voice would soften in tone .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 7]: Then there was Lady Margot Blount !
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 9]: What was the real history of that acquaintanceship ?
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 15]: Why did Victor affect to avoid her , while really meeting her in secret ?
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 23]: While Ruth sat dreaming , tea was brought out , and Mr Farrell came limping down the terrace to join the party .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 54]: It was not often that he favoured them with his presence at the afternoon meal , but the day was so fine and sunny that it was really warmer out of doors than in the house , and as he sat he spread out his wrinkled hands , evidently enjoying the newly-found heat .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 19]: Ruth waited upon him with a pretty deference , while Mollie chattered on in her usual unabashed fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 79]: The old man appeared to pay no attention , but he evidently listened more closely than he cared to admit , for a casual mention of Margot Blount 's name evoked a quick glance and question -- `` You all seem to speak of Lady Margot in a very familiar fashion ; I have not the pleasure of her acquaintance , but from all I have heard I should not imagine she was inclined to make friendships lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 8]: You have met her -- how often ?
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 5]: Once or twice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 32]: He looked at Mollie as he spoke , but Mollie deliberately avoided his eyes , turning towards Victor in a marked manner , which left him no choice but to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 35]: It was a mischievous impulse to avenge herself and Ruth for his desertion of a few days before , and to discover the truth about that secret meeting of which Margot herself had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 32]: Her face seemed solemnity itself to the casual observer , but as he looked at her Jack choked suddenly over his tea , and hitched his chair in an opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 13]: He would have laughed outright if he had looked one moment longer .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 47]: As for Victor , his dark eyes shot out a spark of annoyance , just one ; then he answered with smiling unconcern -- `` Lady Margot and I are not quite strangers , sir ; I met her in town a good deal last year .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 7]: We have some friends in common .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 15]: It was only renewing an acquaintance when we met again the other day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 6]: `` Indeed -- indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 8]: Mr Farrell looked unusually interested and alert .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 8]: `` I am glad to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 13]: The Blounts are some of the most important people in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 23]: In the old days there was a strong friendship between the two families , which I should be pleased to see renewed .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 18]: You were introduced to the old people when you called at the Moat , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 11]: Here was a direct question which could not be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 13]: Jack and Mollie turned towards Victor with glances of elaborately veiled curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 11]: Ruth clattered the tea-cups together , carefully averting her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 35]: Anxious as she was to hear the reply , she hated the knowledge that Victor was being placed in an awkward position , -- hated the consciousness that the others were enjoying the embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 26]: The pause lasted but a moment ; then Victor spoke in his most casual tones -- `` No ; I have not seen them yet .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 36]: I have run across Lady Margot once or twice in my morning rides , and had the opportunity of a talk with her , so I thought it better to defer a more formal call .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 26]: Miss Farrell was kind enough to leave my card , but I did not wish to put myself too much _ en evidence _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 4]: Mr Farrell frowned .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 14]: `` You had better go soon , then -- the sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 22]: As you know the niece , there is all the more reason for paying due respect to the uncle and aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 23]: You will no doubt receive an invitation after this exchange of visits , and it must be returned as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 10]: I knew the girl 's father in his youth .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 6]: He was a fine fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 12]: If she is like him , she must be worth knowing .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 17]: She can not be very young , -- nearer thirty than twenty , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 13]: It is a wonder that she is not married , or engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 11]: Is she engaged , do you happen to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 24]: Again the others waited , leaving Victor to reply , and for the first time a faint flush showed itself on his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 5]: `` I believe not .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 9]: There was no talk of it last autumn .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 14]: I have heard no rumours -- '' `` I am surprised at that .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 26]: It is a poor family , and she will have little or no money ; but the name and position ought to count for something .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 16]: They would be almost more valuable than money to a young man beginning life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 12]: `` I am thankful that I have no name or position !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 18]: I should like my husband to value me for myself , not for what I possessed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 4]: cried Mollie quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 28]: It gave her an uncomfortable feeling , amounting almost to an augury of ill , to hear Uncle Bernard talking of Margot Blount with such unusual interest .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 31]: The first definite wish which he had expressed was in connection with her name ; his last remarks virtually sanctioned with his approval any aspirations which Victor might secretly treasure .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 33]: Lady Margot Blount could hardly be expected to marry a struggling barrister ; but if that barrister were the possible heir of the Court , his importance became at once largely increased .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 48]: Victor was unfailing in his efforts to please his host , and the result of this conversation would inevitably be a closer intimacy with the Blount family , which , even if it led to nothing more serious , would of a certainty cloud Ruth 's happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 71]: Mollie was by no means sure that she approved of Victor as a suitor for her beloved sister , but , with delightful inconsistency , she hated the idea of his daring to care for anyone else , and the thought lent an unwonted edge to her voice -- `` It 's horrid to talk about marriage in that mercenary fashion , as if it were a pure business arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 21]: When I hear such remarks , I 'm thankful that I have n't a penny piece in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 22]: `` If that is your feeling , you would be in a most unfortunate position as the owner of the Court .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 14]: It would be a pity to disturb your equanimity , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 45]: Mr Farrell stretched out his thin hands on his knees , looking at her with quizzical eyes , whereupon Mollie forgot her anger , and gave one of her gay , infectious laughs , nodding her head towards him in mischievous , new-found familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 8]: `` Ah , you had me there !
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 52]: But I might be like Queen Bess , you know , and prize my kingdom above any man ; or , if one came along whom I really wanted to marry , I 'd send him to slay dragons and carry off golden apples , to prove his devotion and disinterestedness .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 13]: Do n't cut me off through any mistaken scruples , Uncle Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 15]: I 'd really make a delightful chatelaine , and I should enjoy it so !
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 14]: No one appreciates the real object of money more than I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 19]: `` And what is your idea of the ` real value , ' if one may ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 8]: `` To spend , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 4]: she answered audaciously .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 24]: `` It is the only thing to do , for if you keep it , it 's just a dull collection of coins .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 4]: I love spending !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 21]: Now , if I became a big heiress to-morrow , would you like to know what I should do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 10]: `` Extremely ; it would be most interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 4]: said Mr Farrell .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 11]: `` Yes , Miss Mollie , do tell us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 3]: urged Victor .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 24]: Jack looked up with a puckered brow , half amused , half anxious , and Ruth murmured a gentle `` Mollie dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 11]: Mollie was not to be deterred by encouragement or warning .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 26]: She lay back in her chair , tapping off each item on her fingers as she spoke , her face one beam of mischievous enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 12]: `` I 'd settle annuities on all my relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 25]: I 'd buy the most exquisite presents , and send them round to everyone who had been kind to me in my poor estate .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 27]: I 'd give huge donations to governess 's Homes , and funds for poor gentlewomen , and send them flowers , and fruit , and game .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 62]: I 'd go to Liberty 's , and buy artistic furniture , and hire experts to superintend decorations , and , while the house was being put in order , I 'd go a voyage round the world , and buy stacks of lovely things at every port , and see all the sights , and come home laden with spoils !
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 24]: Then I 'd settle down , and , '' -- she chuckled complacently -- `` I _ would _ have a good time !
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 18]: I 'd have every single thing I wanted , and never think of what it cost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 17]: `` Until the bailiffs arrived ; which would be surprisingly soon , I should imagine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 5]: said Uncle Bernard drily .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 15]: `` You have not much idea of the responsibility of wealth , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 10]: I prefer not to discuss the point , however .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 25]: My own views , which are peculiar , are set forth in the Will which is lying in the desk in my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 8]: The four young people looked up sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 25]: The same question was on the lips of each ; but it was Victor 's eagerness which first found words -- `` The Will ?
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 3]: -- Now !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 5]: But surely -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 21]: Mr Farrell 's lips twisted into a grim smile , as if he had of deliberate purpose provoked their curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 13]: `` You are surprised that I have already come to a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 29]: It is by no means unchangeable ; but , in the extremely precarious condition of my health , I do not think it safe to delay matters indefinitely .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 20]: This Will was drawn up last week , and is based upon my impressions up to the present time .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 40]: If I live it is extremely likely that I may alter my mind once and again ; but it should be a comfort to you all to feel that , at the worst , I am not unprepared . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 24]: He looked from one to the other with the same faint , mocking smile , his gaze lingering on Ruth 's troubled face .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 29]: Her eyes expressed a questioning so intense as to be almost wild ; then slowly they fell before his , and a crimson tide rushed over her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 4]: HARD AT WORK .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 24]: Preparations for Mrs Thornton 's garden-party went on uninterruptedly during the next week , and grew in fervour as the great day approached .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 46]: Everybody had accepted , as the hostess announced with a groan and a laugh ; and the vicar threatened to be called abroad on urgent business , so alarmed was he at the prospect of the fashionable throng which was to invade his shabby precincts .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 58]: When , however , Mrs Thornton made up her mind to carry out a plan , she was not easily damped ; and aided by Mollie and the younger members of her brood , she weeded , and forked , and clipped at the over-grown garden , until it really began to assume quite a presentable appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 61]: `` I dare n't weed , '' Mollie explained , `` for I 'm a poor town thing , who would probably pull up your most cherished seedlings ; but my arms are so strong that I can mow with the best , so I 'll take the grass in hand , if someone else will trim the borders . ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 12]: `` But your face , my dear -- your face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 16]: cried Mrs Thornton , staring with dismay at the crimsoned countenance beneath the straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 11]: `` I 'm ashamed to let you work so hard !
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 12]: What would your uncle say if he saw you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 7]: `` Something uncomplimentary , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 13]: I know I am magenta , but fortunately it is n't lasting .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 31]: I asked Mr Druce if he would help me this morning , and do a little rolling into the bargain , but he would not give up his ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 25]: Mrs Thornton pursed up her lips , stared first at the ground , then at the sky , then across into Mollie 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 9]: `` He is very fond of riding ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 4]: she said mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 18]: `` I see him pass every morning , going in the same direction , and always alone .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 13]: How is it that none of you ever go with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 15]: `` Jack Melland is still lame , and Ruth and I are only beginners .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 24]: We have little canters together in the afternoons sometimes , but in the mornings he prefers to be free to go longer distances .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 10]: He goes ever so far -- miles and miles .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 15]: One morning last week he met Lady Margot Blount somewhere near the Moat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 32]: `` And one morning this week also , for my husband saw them together , and if I were inclined to gossip , I should say it was oftener than once .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 7]: My dear Mollie , how charming !
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 12]: Are we going to have a love-story to enliven the summer ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 18]: Nobody ever gets engaged or married in this sleepy place , and this would be truly exciting !
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 18]: But I thought at one time -- excuse my saying so , wo n't you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 19]: -- I quite thought he admired your sister , and that there might be a match there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 26]: `` Of course , he admired her -- no one could help it ; but please never hint at anything of the sort to Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 14]: She is very reserved , and would hate to be talked about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 4]: cried Mollie hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 33]: Across the lawn Ruth 's graceful figure could be seen kneeling in front of a bed of flowers which she was fastening to supporting sticks in her usual neat , methodical fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 23]: No one could have recognised that bed as the same confused broken-down mass of blossom which it had been an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 29]: now they do look as if someone loved them , '' said Ruth to herself , straightening her weary back , and brushing the soil off her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 33]: After the Thorntons ' more casual work was over , she had made a careful round of the beds , giving those dainty finishing touches which add so largely to the effect .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 29]: Now her work was finished , and , seeing Mrs Thornton and Mollie standing together , she rose stiffly , and walked across the lawn to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 5]: `` Have you finished ?
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 22]: I think I have really come to the end of the beds , and everything looks delightfully ` cared for ' !
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 26]: I shall bring my camera down on Thursday , Mrs Thornton , and take some snapshots of your guests in pretty corners of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 10]: Did you know I had taken the photographic fever ?
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 28]: I bought myself a really , really nice camera , and I want to take mother a collection of views of the Court when we go home .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 30]: She will value it more than anything else , for I shall snap all her favourite bits in the grounds , and take the interiors with time - exposures .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 21]: They will be nice to look at when we are away , and someone else reigns in our stead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 18]: She shrugged her shoulders as she spoke , and Mrs Thornton patted her arm with kindly encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 5]: `` Nonsense -- nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 17]: You are tired , dear , and that makes you look at things through blue spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 34]: Come into the house , and we will have tea , and discuss the great question of where my guests are to sit , if anything so dreadful as a shower should happen !
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 33]: Two armchairs , you see , half a dozen small ones , more or less unstable -LRB- if anyone over seven stone attempts the green plush there 'll be a catastrophe ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 5]: , and one sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 16]: Now , put your inventive brains together , and tell me what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 19]: There is plenty of room for more furniture , but no money to buy it , alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 18]: `` Let them sit on the floor in rows ; it would be ever so sociable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 4]: said naughty Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 6]: Ruth knitted her brows thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 6]: `` Have you any chair-beds ?
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 45]: We could make quite elegant lounges of them , pushed up against the wall , covered with rugs and banked up with cushions ; or even out of two boards propped up at the sides , if the worst came to the worst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 3]: `` Oh-oh !
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 2]: Chair-beds !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 4]: What an inspiration !
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 9]: I have two stored away in the attic .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 14]: They are old and decrepit , but that does n't matter a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 26]: They will look quite luxurious when the mattresses are covered with sofa-blankets ; but I do n't know where the cushions are to come from .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 21]: I only possess these three , and they must stay where they are to hide the patches in the chintz .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 17]: I might perhaps borrow -- '' `` No , do n't do anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 21]: Use your pillows , and Ruth and I will make frilled covers out of art-muslin , at threepence a yard .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 12]: They will look charming , and lighten up the dark corners .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 11]: We are used to that sort of work at home .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 32]: We made a cosy corner for the drawing-room out of old packing-cases and a Liberty curtain , and it is easier and more comfortable than any professional one I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 12]: The silly upholsterers always make the seats too high and narrow .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 47]: We made a music ottoman of the inside , and broke our backs lining it , and our nails hammering in the tacks ; but , dear me , how we did enjoy it , and how proud we were when it was accomplished for seventeen-and-six !
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 29]: `` I 'm beginning to doubt , '' repeated Mollie solemnly , `` whether it is half so amusing to be rich as it is to be poor .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 41]: When you can get everything you want the moment you want it , you do n't appreciate it half so much as when you have pined for it , and saved up your pennies for it , for months beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 49]: When we get a new thing at home , the whole family pay visits to it like a shrine , and we open the door and go into the room where it is , one after the other , to study the effect , and gloat over it .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: It _ is _ fun ; is n't it , now ?
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: Confess that it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 9]: `` Ye-es , '' agreed Mrs Thornton doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 30]: `` But where you have to wait too long , the sense of humour gets a little bit blunted , especially as one grows older , Mollie dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 30]: She sighed as she spoke , and her eyes roved pensively round the discoloured walls , those same walls whose condition had fired Mollie to make her unsuccessful appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 31]: The girl 's thoughts went back to that embarrassing interview , not altogether regretfully , since it had ended in bringing about a better understanding between her uncle and herself .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 22]: Perhaps , though he had refused her request , it would linger in his mind , and lead to good results .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 10]: Nothing but the unexpected was certain about Uncle Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 23]: The next afternoon the vicarage drawing-room presented a rather chaotic appearance , as Mrs Thornton and her assistants prepared the important couches .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 32]: Ruth sat in the middle of the floor running up lengths of brightly coloured muslins on a sewing-machine , while the other two wrestled with the difficulties which attend all make-shifts .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 56]: With the greatest regard for ease and luxury , the beds were pronounced decidedly too low to look genuine , and the rickety legs had to be propped up with foundations manufactured out of old bound volumes of magazines , bricks from the garden , and an odd weight or two from the kitchen scales .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 41]: The sofa-blankets also turned out to be too narrow , and persisted in disclosing the iron legs , until , in desperation , one end was sewn to the mattress , allowing the full width to hang down in front .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 47]: At last the work was finished , and the hot and dishevelled workers retired to the hall , and , re-entering the room to study the effect , in true Farrell manner , pronounced the `` divans '' to look professional beyond all fear of detection .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 32]: The next achievement was to place a tapering bank of plants against a discoloured patch of wallpaper , and many and varied were the struggles before the necessary stand was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 25]: Eventually an old desk formed the bottom tier , a stool the second , and the baby 's high chair the third and last .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 41]: Draped with an old piece of green baize , with small pots of trailing _ Tradescantia _ fitted into the crossbars of the chair , and the good old family _ Aspidistras _ -LRB- `` as old as Mabel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 41]: explained Mrs Thornton , stroking one of the long green leaves affectionately -RRB- taking the place of honour , the effect was so superior and luxurious that the vicar had to be dragged from his study to exclaim and admire .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 9]: `` There , just look at our divans !
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 9]: Did you ever see anything look more luxurious ?
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 10]: Who could ever suspect they were only a make-up ?
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 10]: Sit down and see how comfortable this is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 43]: cried Mrs Thornton volubly ; whereupon the vicar sat down heavily in the centre of the seat , and promptly descended to the floor amidst a heaped-up pile of bedding , pillows , _ Sunday at Homes _ , and broken bricks .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 32]: He gasped and groped wildly with his hands , and the sight of him sitting prone among the ruins was so comical that both girls went off into peals of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 21]: The humorous side of the accident was not , however , quite so apparent to the mistress of the ceremonies .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 7]: `` That tiresome , tiresome bed !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 7]: I might have known as much !
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 16]: It used to collapse with me regularly when I was nursing Mabel with scarlet-fever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 4]: she cried impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 17]: `` Now we shall have to begin from the beginning , and make it up again .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 13]: How tiresome of you , Arthur , to be so heavy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 11]: `` I will spare you the obvious retort , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 28]: Let us be thankful that I was the victim , and not Lady Elstree , whom you would certainly have escorted to the seat of honour to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 19]: If you will allow me to help , I think I could manage to make things fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 23]: At this critical moment a loud rat-tat sounded at the door , and Mrs Thornton rushed to peep out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 6]: `` Horrors , a visitor !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 13]: Mary will show her into the room , I know she will !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 10]: That girl has no more sense than a doll !
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 6]: Ruth -- Mollie -- Wallace !
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 14]: pick up the things on the floor ; throw them behind the sofa !
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 7]: Pull the sewing-machine to the wall !
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 9]: There 's no room for anyone to tread !
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 16]: Of all the tiresome , aggravating -- '' `` Nonsense , dear -- nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 6]: cried the vicar , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 7]: `` Leave things as they are .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 15]: You have quite sufficient excuse in the fact of expecting a hundred people to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 14]: There will be no room to tread then , if you like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 40]: He turned towards the door as he spoke , and Mrs Thornton hastily smoothed her hair as it opened wide , and Mary 's eager voice announced -- `` If you please , mum , a ` amper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 7]: `` A _ what _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 13]: The vicar and his wife pressed forward eagerly , and , lo !
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 40]: on the well - worn oilcloth of the passage lay a large wicker hamper , addressed to `` Mrs Thornton , The Vicarage , Raby , '' and bearing on the label the name of a well-known London fruiterer .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 34]: To cut the string and tear it open was the work of a moment , when inside was revealed such treasures of hothouse fruits as left the beholders dumb and gasping with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 35]: There in profusion were grapes , peaches , giant strawberries of the deepest red , pineapples , -- each one more perfect and tempting than the last , in their dainty , padded cases .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 37]: The vicar stood looking on , stroking his chin , and smiling with enjoyment at his wife 's delight , as she bent over her treasures , exclaiming and rapturising like a girl in her teens .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 4]: `` How lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 3]: How charming !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 3]: How delightful !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 7]: My fruit-table will be a triumph !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 15]: This is exactly what I needed to give the finishing touch to my preparations !
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 9]: I 've never seen finer fruit -- never !
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 11]: Wallace , Wallace , wo n't we be grand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 26]: `` So grand that I am afraid the churchwardens will have serious doubts as to the school funds , '' said the vicar , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 25]: `` I have twenty pounds in hand at the present moment , and really -- '' `` Oh , do n't be a goose !
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 12]: Of course , everyone will guess that it is a present .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 9]: I shall say so myself on every opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 4]: But who from ?
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 10]: Who can have thought of such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 11]: Her eyes turned with sudden questioning to the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 9]: `` Ruth , Mollie -- did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 5]: `` Indeed , no !
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 14]: I did n't think of it , I am sorry to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 22]: said Ruth ; and added honestly , `` I am too hard up to pay for all those lovely things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 11]: `` And you know nothing about it , really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 10]: `` Really and truly , not a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 82]: `` You do n't think that perhaps the squire -- '' Mollie recalled the snubbing which she had received on suggesting the improvements to the vicarage , coupled with the various cynical remarks to which Mr Farrell had given utterance on the subject of this very garden-party , and felt convinced that he was not the anonymous donor ; but these things were not to be repeated , so she remained silent , while Ruth and Mrs Thornton wondered and speculated .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 35]: No one could be thought of more likely than the squire , for the parishioners , as a rule , were not overburdened with money , nor the few who were , with generosity .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 23]: `` I have never had such a thing done for me all the years I have been here -- never once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 13]: cried Mrs Thornton , waxing almost tearful in her excess of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 14]: `` And to send it anonymously , too -- so modest and unassuming !
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 8]: The dear , kind , thoughtful creature .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 12]: I shall never rest until I know who it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 6]: THE DAY OF THE PARTY .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 70]: The morning of the garden-party was bright , almost perilously bright even for June ; but there was exhilaration in the sight of the blue sky , dappled with fleecy white clouds , which formed such an exquisite contrast to the velvety green of the landscape , and a delicious sense of luxury in strolling about in the sun , and feeling rid at last of the treacherous wind .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 43]: The squire 's guests breakfasted upon the terrace , to the mild disapproval of Mrs Wolff , who could not understand why people could not be content to remain comfortably indoors , instead of picknicking in gipsy-like fashion on every possible occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 37]: Her small , pinched face expressed the annoyance which she had not the courage to put into words , and as soon as her duties were over she hurried back to the shelter of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 27]: Immediately she had disappeared Jack boldly demanded another cup of coffee , and set to work on toast and marmalade with a fresh access of appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 9]: The opportunity was too good to be resisted .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 31]: Ruth flew indoors for her camera , and stood a few yards off focusing the table and its occupants , and waiting for a picturesque moment in which to snap .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 29]: It came at last , just as Jack was forgetfully indulging in an enormous bite , a bachelor habit which had become a standing joke among his companions .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 38]: Mollie had stolen a half-eaten piece of toast from his plate one morning , and measured the gap with an inch tape , to his everlasting embarrassment , so that the pictured memorial was hailed with delight .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 51]: Needless to say , Jack wished to have his revenge , and immortalise Mollie scraping the sugar out of the bottom of the cup in school-girl fashion , and finally Bates was pressed into the service and instructed how to snap , so that a complete group might be taken .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 31]: By this time it was ten o'clock , and Mollie announced her intention of going down to the vicarage to help in the final preparations for the afternoon 's entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 39]: She took for granted that Ruth would accompany her ; but Miss Ruth had her own ideas as to the employment of the next few hours , and they had nothing to do with Mrs Thornton 's garden-party .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 24]: On her way downstairs to breakfast she had overheard Victor telling a servant that he had no orders for the stables this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 82]: The inference was , therefore , that he intended to stop at home , and the thought had instantly darted into her mind that if Mollie went off to the vicarage there would be an hour or two before lunch , when -- when -- Ruth blushed guiltily to herself when she got so far in her calculations ; but it was such a delight to enjoy a quiet _ tete-a-tete _ talk sometimes , instead of the general impersonal conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 31]: So it came to pass that when Mollie announced her intention of going down to the vicarage to help in the final preparations , Ruth absolutely refused to accompany her .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 11]: `` I 've done my share , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 25]: `` To-day I am going to be a visitor pure and simple , and drive down when everything is ready for my reception . ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 6]: Mollie shrugged her shoulders resignedly .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 34]: `` Well , somebody has got to do it , and , thank goodness , I 'm not poor - spirited enough to leave a friend in the lurch at the last moment !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 26]: I sha n't be satisfied until I see the last chair in order ; but I do n't see any reason why I should walk .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 24]: There is a pony-carriage in the stables , and if anyone had any nice feeling they would drive me there and back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 9]: Jack laughed , and limped across the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 9]: `` Anyone , singular ; they , plural !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 20]: Your grammar is deficient , Miss Mollie ; but I suppose your modesty forbade you to be more explicit .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 27]: I have lots of good-feeling , and nothing to do , so I shall be charmed to escort you , if you will give the order .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 14]: It would take me too long to get down to the stables . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 63]: It was evident that Jack 's offer was pleasing to Mollie , for she thanked him with a smile as bright as her words , and a quarter of an hour later on they were driving together across the park behind the sleek little pony , Mollie chatting gaily as usual , Jack listening with an air half amused , half bored .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 51]: Despite his accident , he was looking strong and well , his skin bronzed by the outdoor life of the last few weeks ; but the old haughty , intolerant expression , which had seemed his chief characteristic at first meeting , was still noticeable in curving lip and nostril .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 24]: Not an easy man to convince against his will , nor one to be easily affected by the presence of a pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 15]: `` How cross Uncle Bernard was when I told him about the mysterious hamper !
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 13]: One would think he grudged poor Mrs Thornton having anything nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 4]: said Mollie severely .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 16]: `` He nearly snapped my head off when I asked if he had sent it .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 46]: I should not have thought much of that , if he had not denied it in so many words , for he might have been trying to put me off ; but after what he said there can be no more doubt on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 8]: I wonder who could have sent it ?
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 13]: Mrs Thornton says she will never rest till she finds out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 6]: Jack flicked the pony impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 18]: `` Why ca n't she be content to take it quietly , and not worry any more ?
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 13]: That 's the worst of women -- they must make a fuss !
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 19]: If the man who sent it wanted to be thanked , he would have put in a card .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 35]: If he did n't , it shows that he prefers to be anonymous , and it 's bad taste to go ferreting round trying to find out what she is not intended to know .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 13]: I should tell her so straight , if I were you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 24]: `` No , you would n't , because , being a woman , you would be consumed with curiosity , as I am .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 13]: Now , I wonder why you said the ` man ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 18]: queried Mollie , tilting her head on one side , and staring at him with mischievous eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 10]: `` What makes you think it was a man ?
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 11]: Could n't it as easily have been a woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 26]: `` Oh , quite ; but I prefer to use one pronoun and stick to it , instead of muddling them up as you do .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 15]: Why are you always in such a hurry to snap a fellow up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 4]: cried Jack irritably .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 9]: Mollie made a naughty little _ moue _ .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 10]: `` I thought it was the other way about !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 26]: I was most mild and lamb-like , when you snubbed me for my grammar , abused my sex , and accused me of bad temper .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 12]: It shows how little you know of my beautiful disposition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 13]: Jack flicked the pony again , his face darkened by a frown .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 13]: `` No , I do n't know you -- how should I ?
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: You never give me a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 11]: You show me only the frivolous side of your character .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 9]: You are always laughing , joking , frivolling .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 16]: In all these weeks I have only once had a glimpse of your real self .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 27]: You evidently do not wish me to know you in any real or intimate sense ; but that is your own fault , not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 22]: `` If you have seen it only once , it can not be my real self , '' said Mollie quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 31]: She had grown , not red but white , as she listened to Jack 's words , and her heart had begun to beat in an agitating fashion hitherto unknown .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 30]: She felt as if somebody had suddenly dealt her an unexpected blow , for until this moment she had fondly imagined herself to be good friends with Jack Melland .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 29]: `` You do not know me , because , perhaps , there is nothing to know , beyond the frivolous , silly creature you dislike so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 13]: `` There you go again , exaggerating and catching up my words !
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 6]: Who said I disliked you ?
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 9]: We were not talking of likes or dislikes .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 9]: We were talking of knowing each other properly .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 22]: I would n't trouble my head if you were an ordinary , empty-headed girl , but I know you are not .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 30]: There is another side to your character , and I want to see and know you in it , but you evade me , and refuse to show yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 14]: I suppose I am not worth the trouble of talking to seriously ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 6]: Mollie shook her head dejectedly .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 12]: `` I am not evading , I am not hiding anything .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 10]: I 'm nineteen , and out for a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 12]: It 's the first taste of luxury I 've ever known .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 34]: I enjoyed it so much , '' -- unconsciously to herself she used the past , not the present , tense -- `` that surely it was natural for me to be light-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 15]: I am not highly educated , and I 've lived a very quiet life .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 17]: It 's only natural that I seem stupid in comparison with other girls you have met .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 11]: I suppose they are very clever and well read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 27]: Jack kept his eyes on the road , mentally classifying the girls with whom he had been most closely brought in contact in his town life .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 41]: they were for the most part accomplished and clever ; but were they not also apt to be discontented with their lot , given to grumbling at the restrictions of home life , and to imagine themselves ill-used and unappreciated ?
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 14]: Mollie 's radiant good-humour and unconsciousness of self were qualities unknown among them .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 10]: What poor , anaemic images they appeared beside her !
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 14]: Yet he was continually provoked by the very cheerfulness which he mentally approved .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 7]: Jack frowned , puzzled and disquieted .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 24]: As a rule , he was at no loss to account for his prejudices , but for once he found himself completely mystified .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 20]: What exactly was it that he wanted of Mollie Farrell , the lack of which rankled in his veins ?
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 19]: He could not tell , and annoyance with self gave an added touch of irritation to his tone .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 28]: `` Oh , if you can not distinguish between becoming a bookworm and talking seriously once in a way , there is no more to be said !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 6]: I 'm sorry I spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 18]: Now I suppose you will be offended with me , and the day will be spoiled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 24]: It was not a gracious speech , but Jack did not feel gracious , and he had not much control over his temper .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 37]: An inner voice informed him that he was behaving like a cad , and he acknowledged the truth of the indictment , while in the same moment he was prepared to reply more irritably than before .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 21]: He had not the chance , however , for Mollie 's eyes met his without the faintest shadow of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 18]: There was a subtle change in her expression , but it spoke neither of offence nor anger .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 21]: `` No , I am not vexed ; that would be stupid , for it would only make things worse .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 13]: It is my nature to look on the bright side of things .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 12]: I know I am thoughtless , but it wo n't last .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 14]: I shall be serious enough some day -- perhaps sooner than we think .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 9]: Do n't grudge me my little hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 29]: The face raised to his looked so young and wistful that Jack felt a pang of the same remorse which one feels who has wounded a little child .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 14]: He averted his eyes and drove on in silence , thinking , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 32]: -- The clever town girl would have been mortally insulted if he had dared to criticise her manners or attainments , and would have justified herself by a dozen plausible arguments .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 21]: Mollie was ready to admit everything against herself , and only anxious to save him from any feeling of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 45]: She talked on impersonal topics all the rest of the way to the vicarage , and her smile when she bade him good-bye was resolutely cheerful , but he hated himself as he realised that for the first time there was an effort involved .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 30]: As he turned the pony round the corner of the little lane which bordered the lawn he heard Mrs Thornton 's surprised exclamation , `` Why , Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 10]: and the half-laughing exclamation , `` It 's nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 14]: The sun is so strong , it made my eyes -- smart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 28]: Jack Melland set his teeth and drove on in a tumult of feeling such as he had never known before in the course of his self-satisfied existence .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 8]: Blundering , presumptuous wretch that he was !
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 24]: If any trouble came to Mollie Farrell , he would feel as guilty as if he himself had deliberately brought it to pass !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 2]: CONFIDENCES .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 53]: While Mollie was busy at the vicarage , Ruth took her book to her favourite seat , and prepared to spend a quiet morning ; but to her delight , Victor joined her , and took his place by her side , before she had been seated more than a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: `` He will see Lady Margot this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 38]: He need not ride ahead in the hope of meeting her , '' came the involuntary bitter thought ; but it was impossible to harbour jealousy for more than a minute when alone in Victor 's company .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 42]: Every word , every look , every tone , was filled with a subtle flattery which was not only soothing but inspiring into the bargain , for we are always at our best in the society of those who appreciate us .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 36]: Ruth gazed , with the old delightful sense of well-being , across the beautiful grounds , in which the long slopes of green and wide-spreading trees had already grown dear and familiar as old friends .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 47]: Surely every day it became more certain that this would be her home of the future , since Jack was still determined to return to town the moment he was sufficiently recovered from his accident , and Mollie 's extravagance was plainly distasteful to Uncle Bernard .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 39]: As for Victor , if he really -- really meant ... Ruth did not finish the sentence even to herself , but at the bottom of her mind lurked the inevitable reflection that she stood a double chance .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 47]: Evidently Victor 's thoughts had , to a certain extent , followed her own , for he broke the silence by saying suddenly -- `` That was an extraordinary statement of Mr Farrell 's the other day , -- that he had already made a will .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 27]: I suppose it is a wise precaution under the circumstances , but it gave one rather a shock to know that things were already settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 7]: `` Yes , poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 10]: one hates to realise how ill he must be .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 30]: He does not seem to have grown any worse since we came , so far as an outsider can judge , but he must feel his weakness increasing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 25]: Ruth puckered her brows in a distressed fashion , too much occupied with her own thoughts to notice Victor 's quick glance of inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 25]: His concern had not been for Mr Farrell or his sufferings , but he was quick to change his tone in response to hers .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 19]: `` I expect he does , '' said Victor , `` though he is too well-plucked to complain .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 22]: The doctor told me the other day that these fluctuations are part of the disease , and mean no real improvement .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 19]: He does not give him long , though he thinks it will probably be six months or more .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 38]: It must be more or less of an effort to him having us here , and if his mind is already made up , I wonder he does not prefer to go back to his solitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 11]: `` He said he might still change , you remember .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 10]: The will is only made in case of accidents .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 26]: It does seem strange to think of it lying there all the time , and that one peep at it would end all our wonderings .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 10]: I _ should _ like to see it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 12]: cried Ruth with an outspoken honesty which apparently shocked her companion .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 10]: `` Be careful what you say , Miss Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 25]: Farrell is just the sort of cross - grained old fellow to take all sorts of ideas into his head if he heard you .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 17]: And , besides , you can surely guess for yourself what name you would find ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 10]: Ruth lifted her face to his in quick inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 22]: The brown eyes were for once fully open and looking down at her with an expression half smiling , half melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 10]: `` You know it would be your own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 11]: he said softly , and she flushed in quick denial .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 12]: `` No , no ; it 's impossible to be certain .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 29]: I hope , of course , but -- At first I thought Uncle Bernard liked me best , but lately Mollie seems to have cut me out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 17]: `` But we are told that liking has nothing to do with the great decision . ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 28]: `` I know , and that does away at once with so many qualities with one fell swoop , that one can hardly tell what is left .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 30]: It puts amiability out of the question , and unselfishness and cheerfulness , and -- and tact , and everything which makes us care for a person or not .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 10]: When they are gone , what is left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 25]: `` A great many things , just as Mr Farrell 's knowledge of our characters and actions is far more extensive than you suspect .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 37]: We meet at meals , and in the evening , and for the rest of the day one would imagine that we are beyond his ken , but I have discovered that to be a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 19]: In some mysterious fashion he knows all that we do , and guesses fairly accurately what we think !
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 37]: ... Would you imagine , for instance , that he knew that this seat was our favourite resort , and that we have enjoyed some very pleasant _ tete-a-tetes _ here during the last few weeks ?
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 22]: Would you imagine that he knew who gave me that white rosebud which I wore as a button-hole last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 32]: Ruth 's face was a rose itself at that moment , a red , red rose , as the colour flew from her cheeks up to the roots of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 7]: Her eyes wavered , and fell .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 6]: `` How can he know ?
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 8]: How do you know he knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 10]: she queried confusedly ; and Victor shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 22]: `` How , I ca n't tell you , but I suspect his man James is a useful source of information .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 32]: I know that he knows , because of several caustic remarks which he has let fall from time to time , to which my legal experience easily gives me the clue .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 22]: I have come to the conclusion that he knows pretty well what we are about every hour of the day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 19]: `` Even when you go out riding by yourself , and meet Lady Margot in the lanes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 18]: questioned Ruth , stung by a sudden rising of jealousy , which she was unable to control .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 24]: The words were no sooner spoken than regretted , and regret deepened into shame as Victor turned his calmly surprised eyes upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 3]: `` Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 10]: as I told him myself in the first instance .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 15]: Since then I have been fortunate enough to meet her again once or twice .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 24]: The good vicar saw us together on one occasion ; I presume he hurried home forthwith to spread the news over the parish .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 31]: In these dead-alive places the most casual acquaintance is magnified into a scandal , but fortunately Lady Margot is a woman of the world who is unaffected by silly chatter .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 27]: She has a dull time at the Moat , and is glad to meet a fellow-creature with whom she can have a few minutes ' conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 14]: Personally , I do n't care what the whole parish pleases to say .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 9]: There is only one person whose opinion matters .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 3]: ... Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 8]: what are you trying to imply ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 25]: He moved nearer to her as he spoke , until the arm which rested on the back of the seat almost touched her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 20]: `` Lady Margot is pleased to be friendly and gracious , but she does not belong to my world .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 51]: She is a star far above the head of a poor struggling barrister , even if he were fool enough to aspire to her , which he certainly would not do so long as there are inhabitants of his own sphere a hundred times more beautiful and more attractive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 13]: Ruth shook her head , her eyes fixed shyly on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 21]: `` If the barrister were the heir to the Court , it would make all the difference in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 10]: Uncle Bernard spoke very warmly of the Blount family .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 26]: It might increase your chance , '' she urged , compelled by some impulse which she could not understand to argue against her own wishes .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 17]: `` Perhaps the condition has something to do with ambition , and pride of race . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 18]: `` In that case , again you score the advantage , for you are his direct descendant .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 13]: I think myself , however , that it refers entirely to money .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 13]: He has warned us that he has peculiar ideas on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 11]: Probably he is on the look-out for a similar peculiarity .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 46]: He has consulted me , and Melland also , I believe , on several matters in connection with the estate ; but my ideas are purely businesslike , and Melland is hopelessly happy-go-lucky , so there was nothing original in either his advice or mine .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 18]: from whichever point of view I consider the question , I always come to the same conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 17]: You are the nearest heir ; you are a Farrell in name as well as appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 10]: You are not extravagant nor thoughtless like your sister .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 16]: To Melland , as well as to myself , the result is a foregone conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 14]: I would congratulate you on the spot if I could do so honestly .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 33]: -- I wonder if you will in the least understand what I mean , when I say that I wish it had been any one of the four rather than yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 68]: The face that was raised to his was for a moment simply shocked and surprised , but under his steady gaze comprehension dawned , and Ruth turned hastily aside , saying , in a tremulous voice which vainly struggled to be defiant -- `` I shall remind you of that unkind speech when you are living in state , and I am toiling for my daily bread .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 12]: I could not have believed you would be so unkind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 13]: `` I am not afraid , for that day will never dawn .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 39]: Remember it , rather , when you are reigning here , and a poor fellow stifling up in town refuses the invitations because he longs to accept , and dare not , remembering the difference between us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 16]: It was pretty plain speaking , and Ruth did not pretend to misunderstand its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 8]: At that moment all doubts died away .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 34]: She believed herself to be loved , and as her lover considered himself in an inferior position to her own , she was generous enough to show him her own feelings in return .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 59]: The dark lashes rested upon her cheeks , her lips quivered like a child 's , as she said softly -- `` If I did own the Court , if Uncle Bernard left me everything he possessed , it would be worthless to me if -- if I were separated from the friends I cared for most . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: A SHATTERED IDEAL .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 29]: By four o'clock that afternoon the vicarage grounds presented a festive appearance , as the hundred guests strolled to and fro , arrayed in light , summer-like garments .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 43]: The tennis-lawn was occupied by a succession of players , a ping-pong table stood in a quiet corner and attracted a certain number of devotees , and the grass-plot in front of the study window had been marked out for golf croquet .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 27]: For those less actively disposed there were seats in the prettiest corners , and an endless supply of refreshments served on little tables under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 71]: Ruth was looking lovely and radiant , blissfully conscious of Victor 's presence , even if he were at the further end of the garden ; of a dress and hat which suited her to perfection , and of her own importance in the eyes of the assembly -- Miss Farrell , the squire 's nearest living relation , his image in appearance , and reputed to be his favourite .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 11]: Surely this must be the future mistress of the Court !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 17]: The intoxicating whisper followed her wherever she went , and heightened the flush in her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 4]: `` Berengaria ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 26]: cried a laughing voice ; and she turned to see Lady Margot Blount standing by her side , holding out a slim , gloved hand .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 70]: While most of the girls present were arrayed in chiffons and laces , she wore a perfectly simple lawn dress , with a coarse straw hat shading her face ; but the accessories of shoes , gloves , belt , parasol , and dainty jewelled fastenings were all of an immaculate perfection , and with her tall , graceful carriage she was by far the most striking figure present .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 36]: The two girls had met several times at different houses in the neighbourhood since the formal exchange of calls , and it was not Margot 's fault that the friendship had not progressed still further .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 19]: She was always cordial , almost demonstrative in manner , eager to plan fresh meetings and mutual occupations .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 11]: It was Ruth who persistently put obstacles in the way .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 39]: In spite of Victor 's protestations , she instinctively recognised in Lady Margot a formidable rival , and the knowledge gave her courage to disregard her uncle 's expressed wishes , and neither give nor accept informal invitations .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 29]: To-day , however , in the flush of her success she was full of good-will to the whole world , and the former jealousy was replaced by commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 16]: Poor Lady Margot , poor everybody whom Victor did not love as he loved herself !
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 19]: `` Oh , Lady Margot , I am so glad to see you , '' she cried frankly .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 9]: `` Do come for a stroll with me !
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 19]: I am so tired of being asked how I like Raby , and talking commonplaces to curious strangers .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 9]: Does n't it all look bright and pretty ?
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 11]: If only it will keep fine to the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 28]: `` Oh , we may have a shower , but I do n't think it will be anything more serious Yes ; Mrs Thornton has done wonders .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 6]: Shall we take this path ?
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: It is the narrowest and quietest , so there is the less fear of interruption . ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 12]: Ruth turned in the direction indicated with a somewhat doubtful look .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 41]: A narrow path , bordered on one side by prickly gooseberry-bushes , was hardly the promenade for her perishable fineries ; but while she hesitated Margot led the way forward , and she followed , drawing her skirts tightly together .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 53]: Even so , disaster awaited her , for in the interest of an animated discussion some of the filmy folds slipped from the hand which held the parasol , dragged along the ground , and finally caught with a rip and a jerk , leaving a long jagged tear at the hem .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 13]: Of the two exclamations , Margot 's was far the most distressed .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 7]: `` Oh , my poor Berengaria !
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 9]: How thoughtless of me to bring you here !
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 6]: It 's all my fault .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 13]: I am such a plain-hemmed creature myself that I forgot your frills .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 12]: You must fasten it up at once or you may trip .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 30]: I can give you some pins , and there is a little summer-house at the end of the path , where you can sit down and fasten it properly .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 15]: I 'll stand before the door and screen you from the public gaze . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 20]: `` Oh , thanks , it will be all right ; I am thankful it was not further up .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 12]: The hem can always be shortened , '' said Ruth practically .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 44]: She sat down in a corner of the summer-house , the windows of which were screened by thickly growing tendrils of hop , and , spreading out the tear , began to pin it daintily together , while Lady Margot mounted guard outside .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 38]: A minute passed -- two minutes -- then came the sound of a man 's quick tread , and a voice spoke , a voice broken by a quiver of emotion which could tell only one tale .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 4]: `` Lady Margot !
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 3]: You here ?
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 9]: I have been looking for you all afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 10]: Why did you hide yourself in this out-of-the-way place ?
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 8]: You knew I should be waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 19]: The pin fell from Ruth 's hand , she sat motionless as a statue behind the leafy screen .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 11]: It could not , could not be Victor 's voice !
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 15]: `` I have not been here many minutes , '' Lady Margot replied quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 29]: `` I knew we should meet sooner or later ; but you are a public character to - day , and I must not monopolise your attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 4]: `` Monopolise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 15]: cried the voice again , the familiar voice with the strange , unfamiliar thrill .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 15]: Ruth 's head dropped forward and her hands clasped the seat on either side .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 25]: `` You talk of monopolising , while I starve all week with just a chance five minutes now and then to keep me alive !
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 18]: I rode for about three hours yesterday morning without even a glimpse of you in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 11]: I have been counting the hours until this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 27]: `` Count them just a little bit longer , then ; I have not spoken to half my friends , and we would certainly be interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 35]: Do me a favour and go back to the lawn now , and later on -- say in half an hour -- come to me again , and you shall have your reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 19]: `` I 'd wait a hundred years if I could have what I wanted at the end ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 5]: said the voice passionately .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 20]: Footsteps crunched down the path , then came silence , and the falling of a shadow across the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 20]: Ruth lifted an ashen face , and saw Lady Margot looking down upon her with tender , liquid eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 12]: `` Dear , '' she said gently , `` you heard !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 8]: I _ meant _ you to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 12]: Do n't think me cruel ; it was the truest kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 11]: You and I have something to say to each other .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 11]: I know a quiet nook where we can be alone .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 9]: Come , Ruth -- come with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 38]: Ruth rose mechanically and followed her guide through a door in the wall , which led to a square piece of ground , bare and ugly , -- a cabbage - patch in name and in deed .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 25]: There against the unromantic background the two girls stood looking at each other , face to face with the great question of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 17]: `` Ruth , '' said Margot gently , `` let us be honest with each other .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 6]: It is the only way .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 21]: This man -- Victor Druce -- has come into both our lives ; let us find out where we stand !
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 8]: Shall I tell you my story first ?
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 21]: I met him last summer , when we were thrown constantly together for six weeks , and he attracted me .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 13]: I came nearer loving him than any man whom I had met .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 7]: Why , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 34]: I saw he admired me ; but others had done that , and when I was alone and could think about him quietly there were many things about him I did not like .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: Still , he fascinated me .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 11]: I thought of him a great deal during the winter .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 8]: I looked forward to seeing him again .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 44]: He was not of my world , and it seemed impossible that anything serious could come of it ; but I dreamt dreams ... Then I came here , and found , to my amazement , that he was staying at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 19]: He met me one morning going out for my ride , and since then it has often happened .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 11]: From the first his manner was different ; more assured .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 19]: He told me of Mr Farrell 's proposition , and insisted that the chances were in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 25]: He wished me to look upon him as the future owner of the Court ; a man who would be in my own position .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 24]: He has been making love to me all these weeks , Ruth , but he has not definitely asked me to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 5]: That 's my story !
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 9]: Will you tell me yours in exchange ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 10]: Ruth looked drearily round the bare , ugly patch .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 32]: A moment before she had been living mentally and physically in a land of roses ; now , in an instant , the scene had changed and the beauty had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 70]: `` I think , '' she said slowly , `` that he has been making love to me too ... He has insisted from the first that I am Uncle Bernard 's favourite , the others think so too , and he has made me believe -- only this morning he made me believe -- that he was afraid to speak plainly because of the difference in our position .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 26]: He said I should be a great lady , and he would be working for his bread far away , and thinking of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 26]: Ruth 's voice broke pitifully , but the red flamed in Margot 's cheek , and she reared her proud head with a disdainful gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 3]: `` So !
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 32]: It is as I thought ; he has been playing a waiting game , making love to us both , but keeping himself free until he saw how the land lay .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 29]: If he inherited , Lady Margot Blount would be useful in society ; if he were cut off , he would reserve the chance of marrying the heiress .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 16]: And we have both been deceived , and have imagined that he was in earnest !
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 29]: I have seen him on the stage , and congratulated him on his success , but I was not prepared for such finished acting in real life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: said Ruth drearily , `` you have not been deceived ; he was not acting with you .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 13]: I heard him speak just now , and I felt the difference .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 25]: Oh , Margot , he is playing with me , but he is in earnest with you ; he does really love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 6]: Margot 's lip curled scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: `` It is hardly my idea of love .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 30]: If I am ever married , it shall be to a man who will risk something for my sake , not to a mercenary who thinks first of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 15]: I suspected something of this from the first afternoon I called at the Court .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 25]: You were sitting together on the terrace , and something in his attitude ... Oh , well , why dwell on it any more ?
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 7]: -- it is none too pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 33]: Ruth dear , you have avoided me , and I have seemed to force myself upon you , but I was determined to find out the truth , for both our sakes .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 10]: It is better so , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 11]: Ruth 's dull glance of misery was pathetic to behold .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 21]: `` I suppose it is , '' she said slowly , `` but just now I can not feel glad .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 4]: Everything seems over .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 28]: I was so happy , and it will be so difficult to go on living in the same house , meeting at every hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 26]: It is easier for you , for you need not see him unless you wish , and you do not care as I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 6]: `` Do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 4]: queried Margot gently .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 25]: `` He has been first in my thoughts for nearly a year , Ruth , and you have known him for a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 33]: It is not easy for me , either ; but we must both realise that the Victor Druce of our imagination never existed , but was a creation of our own brains .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 47]: This man -- this adventurer -- who has used us as his tool , must never suspect that he has caused us pain ; we must play our parts without flinching , and let him see more and more clearly that we desire nothing from him .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 21]: It will be difficult , but there is nothing else for it , if we are to keep our dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 32]: Ruth , you have plenty of will-power ; -- one can see it in your face ; you will not let this man deceive you again with his plausible words ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 5]: Ruth shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 14]: The grey eyes shone hard and bright , then suddenly brimmed with tears .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 15]: `` Perhaps , after all , he is not worse than I am myself .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 6]: Perhaps I deserve this lesson .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 12]: Another man asked me to marry him before we left home .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 25]: I did not love him , but he was well-off and had a nice house , and for a few minutes I was tempted .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 38]: I told him so , and he said he did not want me if I could not care for himself alone ... Perhaps if he had begged very hard I might have said ` yes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 8]: Margot smiled -- a very kindly smile .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 11]: `` The cases are not precisely similar , are they ?
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 21]: Instead of playing a double game you were absolutely honest ; much more honest than is usual on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 7]: And he was a wise man .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 9]: I think I should have liked that man !
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 30]: Compare him with Victor Druce sometimes , Ruth ; it may help you to be brave ... Now I am going back to the garden to act my part .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 40]: We will meet and talk again , but we ca n't stay away any longer just now without attracting attention ... Just tell me one thing before I go -- Can you forgive me for shattering your dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 14]: She held out her hand , and Ruth took it in both hers .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: `` I have nothing to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 13]: It is only wakening a little sooner ; that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 4]: she said tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 24]: Margot bent down lightly , and touched her forehead with her lips , then turned swiftly away , and Ruth was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 17]: Poor , disenchanted Ruth , wideawake at last , in the midst of the deserted cabbage-patch !
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 5]: JACK MELLAND 'S SECRET .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 33]: When Mr Farrell 's guests assembled for dinner , on their return from the garden-party , it was at once evident that the old gentleman was in one of his difficult moods .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 36]: From the beginning he had affected to disapprove of Mrs Thornton 's extravagance in attempting to entertain on so large a scale , while sedulously keeping himself informed as to every detail of the preparations .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 30]: The anonymous present of fruit had furnished him with a subject for much satirical comment , as had also the girls ' endeavours to beautify the house and grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 36]: Now he found a fresh grievance in the fact that dinner was delayed a few minutes past its usual hour , and that the young people appeared depressed , rather than elated by their experiences .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 27]: Ruth 's plea of a headache was justified by her wan looks ; Jack was moody , and even Victor was for once silent and distrait .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 28]: It was left to Mollie to stem the tide , and she raised herself nobly to the effort , albeit her own heart was none too light .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 9]: `` It went off beautifully , Uncle Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 12]: Shall I tell you all about it from the beginning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 35]: she cried , smiling at his grim visage across the dinner-table ; and when he declared his lack of interest in the whole concern , she smiled again , and refused to be convinced .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 46]: `` Oh , but you must hear , because in a kind of way it was your party , as you are the patron , and give them all that they have ... There were such crowds of people , and they looked so gay .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 31]: Old Lady Everett wore a magenta satin , quite the most awful garment I ever beheld , and she got hot , poor dear , and it matched her face .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 52]: And such an awkward thing happened ; she brought a little basket with a few under-sized grapes , about a pound , perhaps , and presented them to Mrs Thornton with such an air of munificence , and then turned round and saw the table spread with all that exquisite fruit !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 17]: She was quite angry even when Mrs Thornton explained that it also was a gift . ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 9]: `` Why need she have explained at all ?
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 10]: No other woman would have thought of doing so .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 18]: Why should a clergyman 's wife be expected to explain her private affairs to any inquisitive stranger ?
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 15]: Surely it is her own business what she puts on her own table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 23]: This from Jack , in a burst of querulous impatience which brought his host 's eyes upon him with an answering flash .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 28]: `` If a woman in a public position provides what is obviously unsuited to her means , the least she can do is to offer an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 12]: A clergyman 's means do not run to expensive entertainments . ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 26]: `` Exactly ; yet he is expected to entertain , and to humble his pride to do it in an inferior style to his neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 33]: And his wife is expected to accept paltry gifts from her neighbours which another woman in her position would look upon as an insult , and to be thankful for the chance .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 23]: I suppose she often is thankful , poor creature , as she has not the means of providing properly for herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 24]: Mr Farrell put down his knife and fork , and , leaning back in his seat , stared fixedly in Jack 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 11]: His thin lips worked , and his eyes gleamed ominously .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 25]: `` May I ask if you are speaking in general terms , or individually of the clergyman 's wife in my own parish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 5]: Jack shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 22]: `` Oh , I suppose she would be included , since her husband 's income is insufficient for her needs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 17]: `` You are aware , of course , that I am responsible for that income ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 18]: `` I suppose so -- in a way , since the living is in your gift . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 13]: `` And what grounds may you have for considering it insufficient ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 21]: Jack burst into a short laugh , undeterred by the appealing glances cast upon him by three frightened feminine listeners .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 4]: `` What grounds ?
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 35]: Why , the house is an advertisement of shabbiness ; the vicar 's coat is green with age , and the poor little kiddies look as if they had come out of the ark !
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 31]: Mrs Thornton has pluck enough for a dozen , or she would never keep things going as she does ; but she looks an old woman before her time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 18]: `` Then it is your deliberate conclusion that I ought to increase the Vicar 's stipend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 20]: Under cover of the tablecloth a little hand stole along and laid a gentle pressure on Jack 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 41]: He turned and met Mollie 's eyes , grave and appealing , with no trace of the frivolity of which he had complained earlier in the day , and , at the sight , his irritation died a sudden death .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 15]: Mollie must indeed have forgiven him when she condescended to so sweet an intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 18]: The rush of joy which accompanied the thought put him at once at peace with all men .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 16]: `` The labourer is worthy of his hire , sir , '' he answered quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 21]: `` I call Thornton a rattling good fellow , and I should like to see him relieved of monetary troubles .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 28]: It 's hard lines to expect a man to be an example of all the virtues when he is constantly wondering how to make both ends meet .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 33]: I do n't set much store on money , as you know , but I should enjoy being in the position to do a good turn to a man like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 11]: Mr Farrell 's sunken eyes gave forth a malicious gleam .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: `` You speak with feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 11]: Perhaps you have been enjoying a foretaste of the experience .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 27]: Surely you must be the generous Unknown who contributed the hamper of fruit of which we have heard so much during the last few days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 25]: There was a simultaneous gasp of surprise round the table , and everyone turned to stare with curious eyes at Jack 's scarlet face .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 23]: Scarlet , with an embarrassment which plainly proved the truth of the accusation ; with anger , too , and thwarted self-will .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 25]: His nostrils inflated in the old haughty manner , as he replied coldly -- `` I thought we were discussing Mr Thornton 's income !
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 15]: I fail to see what the hamper has to do with the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 15]: Mr Farrell gave the short , staccato sound which did service for a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 4]: `` Your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: It is to me a very interesting sidelight .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 16]: I am indebted to you for stepping in to make up for my deficiencies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 16]: `` It was very kind of you , Mr Melland -- very , very kind !
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 10]: You do n't know how much pleasure it gave .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 16]: I envy you for having had such a nice thought , '' said Ruth earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 32]: For a wonder Mollie was silent , while Victor shrugged his shoulders , and cried , between a sneer and a laugh -- `` You are a sly dog , Melland .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 18]: I had no idea that you were such a devoted admirer of the redoubtable Mrs Thornton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 11]: The sneer brought Jack to his bearings in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 17]: Every trace of embarrassment disappeared as he faced Victor across the table , wide-eyed and defiant .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 10]: `` It is the truth , none the less .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 6]: I admire Mrs Thornton immensely .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 15]: She is a capital little woman , and fights the odds like a Spartan .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 22]: This garden-party business was a great event in her life , and she prepared for it by a series of make-shifts .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 8]: I got sick of hearing about them .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 20]: Poor little soul , why should n't she be able to do the thing decently once in a while ?
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 18]: She 's been very kind to us ; it was little enough to do in return . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 9]: `` Oh , well , everything is comparative .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 13]: You must be pretty flush to send about hampers of that description .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 7]: I have never tasted finer fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 22]: I am sorry that such generosity is beyond my means , '' said Victor , whereat Jack scowled all the more .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 22]: `` You would have spent as much on your lunches and teas if you had been in town these last weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 17]: What is the use of money if you ca n't be reckless once in a way ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 34]: I am sorry that this subject has come up ; but , as it has , I must ask you all to be good enough not to speak of it to Mrs Thornton .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 9]: She would gush , and I loathe gush .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 18]: The secret is my own , not yours , so you must please respect my wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: Once more Ruth came to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: `` Of course , we will keep your secret .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 15]: We have no right to tell without your consent , '' she said decisively .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 14]: Her grey eyes smiled at him across the table with a wistful sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 11]: This man , at least , was true and honest .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 28]: Quick-tempered he might be , self-willed and impatient , but one could never imagine Jack Melland playing a double part , nor selling his soul for greed .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 48]: And yet -- and yet , one glance from Victor 's eyes had power to affect her as Jack Melland 's most earnest effort could never do ; and Uncle Bernard , sharp - sighted as he was , treated Jack with far less confidence and favour .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 23]: `` But I was never sure of him all the time , except for those few hours yesterday , '' she thought .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 10]: `` I _ felt _ there was something behind .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 38]: When Dr Maclure spoke to me that afternoon I knew that he meant all , and more than all , that he said ; but it is not easy to make the imitation like the real thing .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 19]: The moment I heard him speak to Margot I knew the difference -- oh , such a difference !
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 8]: I shall never be deceived again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 51]: She sat trifling with her fruit , unheeding the conversation around her , yet dimly conscious that a passage-at-arms was still being carried on between Mr Farrell and Jack ; the former indulging in caustic remarks at the young man 's expense , Jack replying with more or less irritation .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 35]: A sudden gleam of excitement on Victor 's face recalled her wandering thoughts , in time to hear Jack reply quickly -- `` You are quite right , I am an invalid no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 13]: I walked about most of the afternoon and feel none the worse .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 11]: I can manage even the stairs with a little help .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 11]: In another few days I shall be ready for work .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 57]: There will then be no need for me any longer to trespass -- '' Suddenly he stopped ; and though Mr Farrell sat waiting in silence for several moments , he did not attempt to finish the sentence ; for another gentle pressure on the elbow had reminded him of the wisdom of self - control .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 19]: He sat with downcast eyes and firmly shut lips until Mr Farrell 's mocking voice broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 22]: `` Since Mr Melland has nothing more to say , it would perhaps be as well if we made a move .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 21]: I will ask you to excuse me for the rest of the evening , as I am feeling fatigued . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 27]: He rose as he spoke and turned towards the door , but even as he did so he staggered , and uttered an exclamation of pain .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 34]: Mrs Wolff echoed the cry and sank back in her chair helpless and unnerved ; but in an instant Victor was at his side , supporting him with a strong , steady arm .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 29]: `` Send for James , '' he said , addressing the butler in the quiet tones of one who knows how to keep his head in an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 18]: `` Let me help you into the hall , sir ; you will have more air there .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 5]: Lean upon me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 45]: They moved slowly forward together , the bowed figure seeming momentarily to shrink in stature , while the glimpse of cheek , as he turned towards the door , was so ashen in colour that the girls clasped each other 's hands in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 30]: Then James appeared , alert , composed , capable , a carrying-chair was brought forward from some secret hiding-place , and the invalid was borne upstairs to his room .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 19]: `` It 's one of his ` turns , ' miss , '' the butler explained to Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 17]: `` He used to have them constantly , but it 's the first since you came .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 16]: We 'll send down for the doctor , and he 'll probably stay all night .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 10]: You can never tell how things may go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 9]: Jack Melland limped off towards the deserted smoking-room .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 62]: Five minutes before , as he sat resolutely silent , he had determined to go to Mr Farrell as he sat in the library that evening , and , in the quiet of a _ tete-a-tete _ , announce his determination to leave the Court before the week was out ; but now , once again , circumstances conspired against him .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 36]: There was a greater question at stake than his own miserable comings or goings , for the shadow of death hovered over the Court , and none could tell what the morning might bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 3]: MRS. WOLFF .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 16]: The next morning Mr Farrell was reported better , though unable to leave his bed .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 34]: His old friend , the doctor , had stayed with him for the greater part of the night , and had now taken his departure , pronouncing all immediate danger to be over .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 38]: A few days ' rest would no doubt make the patient much as he had been before , to outward seeming , though to the professional eye , a little weaker , a little nearer the end .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 20]: At breakfast Mrs Wolff fussed in a feeble , self-injured manner because she was not admitted to the sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 14]: `` It is so dreadful for him to be left without a woman !
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 14]: I ca n't think how he will be nursed without a woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 32]: she repeated monotonously , while her hearers breathed an earnest wish that , when their turn came to be nursed , it might not be by a woman of her calibre .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 15]: Mr Farrell was a hundred times better off with his quiet , capable James .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 37]: A shadow of depression rested upon all the young people , though Ruth could not help feeling thankful for a reasonable excuse for a sadness which had nothing to do with Uncle Bernard or his health .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 25]: Now , no one would wonder if she were sad or silent , and she would escape the questioning she had so much dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 29]: Immediately breakfast was over she announced her intention of devoting the morning to photography , and disappeared indoors , while Victor took his accustomed path to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 20]: Mollie would have followed her sister , but Jack detained her with an appeal which could not be denied .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 12]: `` Stay and talk to me a little while ; do !
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 12]: or I shall think you are offended by my stupidity yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 11]: I have to thank you for your reminder last night .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 24]: If you had not stopped me I should have spoken even more strongly than I did , and have been filled with remorse .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 19]: As it is , I do n't think anything I said could have been responsible for this attack .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 14]: Considering all things I kept pretty cool , did n't I now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 12]: `` I think you did , '' conceded Mollie , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 23]: `` No ; I expect it has been coming on for some days , and that was why he was so cross .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 14]: You generally find people are ill if they are more than usually snappy .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 4]: Poor Uncle Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 19]: I wish one could help ; but I am glad he has not Mrs Wolff to fidget him .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 44]: Do you know , '' said Mollie , fixing her candid eyes upon Jack 's face , and inwardly rejoicing at having hit on an impersonal topic of conversation , -- `` do you know Mrs Wolff is an unending problem to one !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 26]: I think about her for hours at a time , and try to puzzle her out , but I never get one step further . ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 18]: Jack searched in his pockets for materials , and began rolling up one of the everlasting cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: `` I 'm surprised to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 14]: I should not have thought she could have occupied more than two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 15]: For my own part I find it impossible to think of her at all .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 12]: She was born ; she exists ; she will probably die !
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 12]: Having said so much , you have exhausted the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 10]: `` Not at all , '' contradicted Mollie frankly .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 8]: `` There 's lots more to consider .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 20]: What is she really , and what is the real life that she lives inside that funny little shell ?
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 33]: And was she ever a child who laughed and danced , and raced about , and was good and naughty , and played with toys , and lived among giants and fairies ?
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 23]: We _ lived _ fairy tales , Ruth and I , and had giants to tea in a nursery four yards square .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 23]: And we hunted ferocious lions and tigers , who either turned out kind and harmless , or were slain by imaginary swords .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 27]: Did Mrs Wolff always know exactly that two and two make four , and never by any chance made a delicious pretence that it was five ?
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 56]: And when she went to school had she a chum whom she adored , and wrote letters to every other day filled with ` dears ' and ` darlings , ' and did she ever shirk ` prep , ' or play tricks on the teachers , or sit up to a dormitory supper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: `` Certainly not !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 46]: She was a good little girl who never soiled her pinafore , nor dreamt of anything she could not see , and she worked hard at school and remained persistently in the middle of the class , and gained high marks for neatness and decorum .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 19]: She never had a chum because she is incapable of caring for one person more than another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 10]: `` But what about ` poor Mr Wolff ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 14]: Surely she must have had , at least , a preference for him !
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 34]: That 's another problem -- how did anyone come to fall in love with her , and what did he fall in love with , and why , and when , and where ?
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 15]: I long to know all about it , for it seems so incomprehensible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 9]: Jack laughed with masculine amusement at her curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 6]: `` Not incomprehensible at all .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 11]: I can give a very good guess how it happened .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 46]: She was a timid , shrinking , little thing , rather pretty -- her features are not at all bad -- and ` poor Mr Wolff ' was a big burly fellow who took a fancy to her because she was a contrast to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 15]: She did n't say much , so he credited her with thinking the more .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 17]: She agreed with everything he said , so he considered her the cleverest woman he knew .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 28]: He discovered his error , no doubt , in sackcloth and ashes , poor fellow ; but mercifully he had not to endure many years of disenchantment .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 17]: I ca n't imagine a worse fate than being tied for life to an automaton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 12]: Mollie pondered , pinching her soft chin between thumb and finger .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 43]: `` He might not be so particular as you ... Did you ever ... Have you ever , -- I mean , did you ever meet ... '' Jack blew a cloud of smoke from between his lips with a half-embarrassed smile .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 16]: `` Did I ever meet a girl whom I imagined might be my Mrs Wolff !
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 8]: Is that what you want to ask ?
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 4]: Yes -- once !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 6]: -- for a passing moment .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 22]: We met , and I caught a glimpse of her face , and recognised it as the fulfilment of a dream .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 4]: Then she disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 12]: Romantic , is n't it , and disappointing into the bargain ?
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 38]: I am not a sentimental fellow , I suppose , for I have never even imagined myself in love , though I have known scores of charming girls ; but at that moment I realised possibilities ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 8]: `` But , oh , how disappointing !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 5]: Did she really disappear ?
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 6]: Could n't you find her ?
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 11]: Is there no chance that you may meet again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 14]: `` Sometimes I think there is ; at other times it seems impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 15]: In any case , I am powerless to help , or to hinder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 12]: `` I should not say that if I were a man !
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 12]: I would search the world over till I found her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 25]: Mollie sat silently , with bent head and thoughtful air , then suddenly lifted her eyes to his with a sweet , grave glance .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 9]: `` I hope you _ will _ meet !
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 21]: I hope you will be very happy together some day , -- you , and your Lady of Dreams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 11]: Jack looked at her , and his face changed strangely .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 37]: He said nothing , not even a word of thanks for her good wishes , and presently got up from his seat , and limped into the house , leaving Mollie depressed and self - reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 10]: `` I suppose I should not have said it .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 14]: He thinks it ` gush , ' and wo n't condescend to answer .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 7]: I wonder what she was like ?
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 17]: Dark , I suppose , and stately , and serious ; the very opposite from me .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 18]: She will appear again some day , and they will be married and look so handsome together .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 20]: I 'm awfully , awfully glad ; at least , I should be if Uncle Bernard were not ill .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 24]: That makes one feel so dull and wretched that one ca n't be glad about anything , '' said poor Mollie to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 43]: Jack did not appear again ; and she was not in the mood to take any interest in Ruth 's photographic efforts , so she strolled through the grounds and gathered an armful of flowers to send home to the little mother .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 40]: This was always a pleasant undertaking , and just now there was a special reason for choosing the freshest and most fragrant blossoms , for the last few letters had hinted at a recurrence of the old money troubles .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 6]: `` Something is up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 7]: wrote Trix , in school-girl parlance .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 40]: `` Father and mother are talking in his den all the evening , and she comes down to breakfast with her eyes swollen with crying , and he looks like a sheet , and does n't eat a bite .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 8]: Horrid old business again , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 5]: How I hate it !
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 27]: We shall have to scrape a little more , I suppose ; and where we are to scrape from , I 'm blest if I know !
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 17]: My blue serge is green , and the boys ' Etons shine like the rising sun .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 16]: It was a fine day on Sunday , and they fairly glittered going to church .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 41]: I do n't want to give you the blues , but thought I 'd better tell you , so that you could write to cheer them up , and also be more assiduous in your attentions to the old man .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 25]: You must and shall get that fortune between you , or we shall be bivouacking in the workhouse before you can say Jack Robinson !
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 11]: My heart too truly knows the signs full well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 11]: Mollie recalled these expressive sentences , and sighed in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 5]: `` Poor old Trix !
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 24]: too bad that she should be left at home to bear the brunt , while we are living in the lap of luxury .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 27]: I expect it is just one of the old crises , and we shall worry through as usual , but it is depressing while it lasts .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 11]: I ca n't endure to see mother with red eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 12]: She will smile when she sees these roses , bless her !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 30]: I defy anyone not to enjoy opening a box of flowers ; and when we go home we will cheer them up again , -- fortune or no fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 21]: Dear old Trix shall have some of my fineries made down , as a change from the green serge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 44]: Mollie 's spirits lightened perceptibly as she loitered about the garden , for to a town-bred girl it was luxury indeed , not only to look upon a wealth of roses , but to be able to gather them lavishly as she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 71]: When the basket was full of half-opened beauties , ranging in every shade , from white to the bloomy crimson of `` Prince Camille , '' she turned to more shady corners for the sprays of ferns and foliage , which are even more prized than flowers themselves by the unhappy dwellers in cities , then returned to the house to find a box and pack it for the post .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 17]: The terrace was empty , but Mrs Wolff was sitting knitting just inside the drawing-room window .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 14]: `` Your uncle is better , '' she announced , as Mollie approached .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 27]: `` He has had a quiet sleep since breakfast , and James thinks he will be able to sit up for an hour or two to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 11]: I have n't seen anything of Ruth or Mr Melland .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 37]: Mr Druce came back from the stables to say that he was not going to ride to-day , but take a long walk , and he would be sure to be home in time for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 9]: He is always so kind and considerate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 28]: The poor little woman looked wan and dispirited , and Mollie reflected with a pang of remorse that she herself had shown little consideration for her feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 31]: Even a nonentity , it appeared , could feel dull when left by herself in a big , empty house , and also could appreciate a little act of thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 53]: Victor disappeared so regularly for the morning hours , that it seemed strange that he should have especially explained his intentions this morning of all others ; but perhaps he had done so , just because to-day was distinguished by a special load of anxiety which he was anxious not to increase .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 42]: Mrs Wolff lived in a constant state of fidget , and even so little a thing as the uncertainty whether the household would assemble punctually to partake of the luncheon which she had ordered , might easily add to her distress .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 22]: `` He is awfully considerate at times ; much more than the rest of us , '' Mollie admitted to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 28]: `` He never forgets the least little thing that Uncle Bernard says or does , or likes or dislikes , while I -- silly , blundering thing !
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 22]: -- always try to help him out of his chair at the wrong side , or stumble over his sticks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 14]: She stood looking down at Mrs Wolff with a new impulse of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 36]: Hitherto , they had seemed divided by an impassable gulf , but this morning the girl 's usual radiant sense of well-being had died away , and left a little rankling ache in its place .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 54]: `` Uncle Bernard 's illness , and this new bother at home , '' was Mollie 's explanation even to her own heart , but the result thereof was to fill her with pity for the life of a woman whom nobody loved , and who was homeless in a land of homes .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 39]: She sat down beside Mrs Wolff , determined to make the hour before luncheon pass more cheerfully than its predecessor , and a few judicious questions soon set the good lady 's tongue prattling over past and future .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 35]: She said that as a girl she had always had a partiality for blue merino , and had owned a Dunstable bonnet , trimmed with roses , which was said to be particularly becoming .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 18]: It was a pity that roses faded so in the sun ; ribbons were more economical wear .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 16]: Did Mrs Connor buy her fish wholesale from Whitby , or retail from a fishmonger ?
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 42]: They did say there was a great saving in the former way , only you got tired of cod , if it were a very big fish ... The worst of a large house was having to keep so many servants !
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 26]: A friend of hers , who was `` reduced , '' said she had never known what comfort meant till she came down to two .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 9]: That James really took too much upon himself !
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 15]: Talking of black-currant jelly -- how beautiful the peaches were on the south wall !
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 38]: Her cousin 's little boy -- Eddie , not Tom -- fell over a garden barrow the other day , and it might have been most serious , for the shears were only a few yards away .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 7]: Children were more trouble than pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 39]: Poor Mr Wolff always regretted having none , and she used to remind him of the school bills , and the breakages , and the dirt in the house ... Had Mollie ever knitted comforters for deep-sea fishermen ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 9]: They said their ears did get so cold .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 18]: There was nothing like an onion boiled really soft , and made into a poultice for ear-ache .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 16]: Her cousin 's little boy -- Tom , not Eddie -- had it very badly .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 9]: Dear , dear , to hear his shrieks !
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 9]: They found onion much better than camphorated oil .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 17]: When Mr Farrell died , she supposed whoever came into possession would re-cover the drawing-room furniture .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 26]: It needed it , and you got lovely patterns from London ... On and on the stream flowed , until Mollie felt dazed and bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 43]: Mrs Wolff evidently felt it such a treat to have a listener that she was capable of continuing for hours at a time , and it was only the sounding of the gong for lunch which brought an end to the monologue .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 28]: In its passing it had seemed a quiet , uneventful morning ; no one guessed what importance its coming and going would assume in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 4]: AN UNPLEASANT INTERVIEW .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 50]: Mr Farrell kept to his determination to see none of his visitors until he was able to come downstairs , but he sent a message by James , to the effect that he would be annoyed if his indisposition were allowed to interfere in any way with social engagements .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 34]: Therefore , dinner-parties being the order of the day , the four young people feasted abroad every evening , and spent the afternoons at various tennis and croquet parties instituted in their honour .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 41]: The rush of gaiety was in full swing , and the list of invitations which ought to be accepted stretched so far ahead that it seemed as if there would be little time left in which to entertain in return .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 55]: In earlier days the girls had delighted to discuss gorgeous and bizarre ideas , smacking more of the Arabian Nights than of an English country house , by the execution of which they hoped to electrify the county and prove their own skill as hostesses ; but of late these schemes had been unmentioned .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 38]: Ruth was too much crushed by her disappointment to have spirit for frivolities , and the shadow of the universal depression at home , as well as at the Court , cast its shadow over Mollie also .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 44]: In a half-hearted way both girls were glad of the engagements which prevented _ tete-a-tetes _ , which had grown difficult and embarrassing , yet with the unreasonableness of her sex Ruth felt doubly hurt to realise that Victor shared in her relief .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 24]: She had expected to have difficulty in avoiding him , and to hear reproaches for her coldness , but neither expectation was fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 30]: `` I suppose he thinks that he has made things safe with me by that last conversation , and can afford to take a little holiday and enjoy himself .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 11]: He does not want to compromise himself too far ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 18]: Ruth told herself , with a touch of bitterness which had developed during the last few days .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 61]: She knew that Victor 's long absences in the morning were spent in trying to waylay Lady Margot in her walks and drives , and had the best authority for knowing him to have been successful more than once , for Margot had been present at one of the dinner-parties and had seized an opportunity to have a quiet word .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 10]: `` I have met Mr Druce twice this week .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 21]: I could have avoided him by staying in the grounds , but I do not wish to rouse his suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 24]: He wo n't risk anything definite until matters are decided between you and Mr Farrell , and then he shall learn his lesson .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 13]: From which of us he learns it , it does not matter .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 22]: In the meantime , I shall make no change , and he can come and go as he sees fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 12]: `` You must be very -- very sure of yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 16]: said Ruth wistfully ; at which Margot reared her little head with a haughty gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 4]: `` Absolutely sure !
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 44]: If he had dared to ask me six months ago , I might have given up everything to be the wife of the imaginary Victor , but now I will not alter the slightest plan out of consideration for the real Mr Druce .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 32]: I can trust myself ; but , '' -- she turned a grave , direct gaze on the other 's face -- `` can _ you _ trust me , Ruth ?
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 26]: I do n't concern myself about appearances , so it is possible you may hear rumours which may not seem in keeping with our agreement .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 28]: Can you trust me enough to believe that , however strange things may seem , I am really considering your interests even more than my own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 16]: `` I think I can -- oh yes , I am sure I can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 4]: replied Ruth hesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 13]: But even as she spoke a doubt crept up in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 25]: If Victor did , indeed , become the owner of the Court , and remained persistent in his wooing , could Margot withstand him ?
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 6]: She had loved him once .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 14]: Would not the old feeling revive , and prove too strong for argument ?
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 25]: It was Ruth 's nature to distract herself with doubts and fears , and the little conversation did not help to raise her spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 29]: On the fifth morning after Mr Farrell 's seizure he came downstairs to his study , and was reported by the doctor to be in fairly good health .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 57]: He did not appear at luncheon , however , and there was something darkly mysterious about James 's manner when he came into the dining-room when the meal was nearly over to announce that his master wished to see the young ladies , with Mr Druce and Mr Melland , in the library at five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 13]: `` And me -- surely he wishes to see me also ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 9]: Mrs Wolff cried , in an injured tone .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 19]: But James only bowed , and repeated inflexibly -- `` Only the young ladies and gentlemen , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 12]: I understand that he wishes to see them on business . ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 2]: Business !
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 23]: That word was enough to keep five minds working busily during the hours between luncheon and the time appointed for the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 14]: Had Uncle Bernard come to some definite conclusion during those quiet days upstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 23]: Was the period of probation over , or did the summons simply imply some new and eccentric phase of the old routine ?
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 43]: Conjecture ran riot ; but at the first sight of the old man 's face all pleasant expectations died a sudden death , for it was fixed in a stern , unbending anger , such as his guests had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 36]: Hardly replying to their congratulations and inquiries , he motioned them impatiently to the seats ranged in readiness facing his chair , exactly as they had been on that first important interview five weeks before .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 29]: Only five weeks , thirty-five short days , yet each of the squire 's guests felt as if a lifetime of experience yawned between that day and this !
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 32]: `` I have sent for you , as it is necessary to speak on an unpleasant topic , which , however , can not be avoided , '' Mr Farrell began .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 25]: `` It is painful for me to open it , especially as I am urged to avoid excitement ; but I have no alternative .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 27]: You may remember that shortly before I was taken ill , I referred to the draft of my will which was lying in this desk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 14]: He stretched out his hand , and laid it on the polished surface .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 50]: `` It was kept here with other important papers , arranged in a special manner , which I have adopted for years , partly for the sake of neatness , partly to ensure them against interference , for it is impossible that they should be touched without my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 21]: This morning , on coming downstairs , my first task was to add some memoranda to one of these papers .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 37]: I opened the desk , and discovered at once that my will had been opened and read -- '' He stared grimly across the room , and four flushed , bewildered faces stared back at him .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 44]: The silence lasted for several moments ; then Jack spoke in his haughtiest and most intolerant tone -- `` You do not , of course , wish to imply , sir , that you suspect us of having any hand in the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 11]: I presume you want our help in unravelling the mystery ?
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 29]: My own detective powers are not of a high order ; but if you will explain your system -- '' Mr Farrell interrupted him with a raised hand .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 12]: `` Thank you , I prefer to make my own inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 38]: As I said before , it is a disagreeable duty ; but when a duty is forced upon one , the best course is to perform it in the most strict and business -- like manner possible .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 52]: You are the people most concerned in my will , the people who would naturally feel most interest and curiosity in seeing it ; therefore , apart from sentimental considerations , on you the first suspicion must fall , and it is right that I should question you before outsiders . ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 5]: Jack 's eyes flashed .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 18]: He rose from his chair and limped across the floor , as if unable to keep still .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 11]: `` I am afraid it will be of little use .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 39]: If a fellow is sweep enough to pry into another man 's secrets , he is equal to lying about it into the bargain , and in that case you have no chance in finding out the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 8]: You have been upstairs for five days .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 16]: It is impossible to account for all that may have happened during that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 27]: `` I have been upstairs five days , as you say , but it happens that I can reduce the time to a much narrower limit .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 37]: On the evening after I was taken ill , it occurred to me that I had not locked my desk the night before , as I expected to return to the library as usual after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 8]: I sent James downstairs to make sure .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 15]: He found it open , locked it , and brought me back the key .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 30]: The lock is a patent one , and has not been tampered with , therefore whoever examined the will must have done so on Wednesday morning or afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 5]: Victor looked up quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 17]: `` You allowed your man to lock it , you trusted him with the key ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 21]: He has been twenty years in my service , and knows exactly what provision I have made for his future .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 19]: He will not need to work after my death , and has no personal interest in my will .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 11]: Moreover , I trust him as I would myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 17]: Mr Farrell spoke sharply , evidently annoyed that any doubt should be cast upon his favourite .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 37]: As he finished his eyes met Mollie 's fixed upon him with an angry challenge , to which he was not slow to respond -- `` Well , what have you to say , young lady ?
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 10]: Can you throw any light on this mystery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 24]: `` I have not opened your desk and pried among your papers , if you really mean to ask me such a question .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 36]: I have lots of faults , but I 've never been suspected of anything so mean as that , and I do n't care to stay in a house where anyone can believe it possible !
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 11]: I do n't want to see the horrid old will !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 29]: We should all have been content and happy if it had not been for the thought of it ; and I never want to hear it mentioned again .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 15]: I do n't know how you dare insult us so , Uncle Bernard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 14]: `` That will do , Mollie ; you have given me your answer .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 8]: There is no need to get excited .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 16]: You had better go back to the drawing-room while I speak to your companions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 28]: The squire leant back in his chair , waiting for her to go ; and , willing or unwilling , there was no defying that grim silence .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 34]: Mollie marched across the floor with defiant tread , opened the door , and closed it behind her with a bang , so expressive of temper that Jack could not resist a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 37]: It vanished quickly enough , however , as he listened to Mr Farrell 's next words -- `` I must ask you to tell me in so many words whether you know anything of this matter .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 26]: If a sudden access of curiosity should have proved too strong for resistance , a candid confession would be the best means of obtaining forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 9]: I could overlook anything better than deceit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 33]: He looked at the three young faces before him with a scrutiny that had something pathetic in its earnestness ; but , as it met with no response , his expression hardened .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 28]: `` Perhaps you would be good enough to tell me , in the first place , whether any of you were in the library on Wednesday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 20]: He looked at Victor as he spoke , and the dark eyes met his without a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 21]: `` I went out for a long walk immediately after breakfast , and returned when luncheon was on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 19]: Afterwards Melland and I smoked on the terrace until it was time to drive over to a tennis-tea .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 29]: I forget which house it was held at , but I remember we heard that the carriage was at the door , and had to rush for it .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 10]: That was so , was n't it , Melland ?
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 17]: I think I should have little difficulty in proving an alibi for the whole day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 12]: Mr Farrell hesitated for a minute , then turned towards Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 7]: `` And you , Melland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 9]: `` Oh , I was about the house !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 26]: I do n't remember going into the library , but I might have done so half a dozen times , and forgotten all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 20]: You gave me permission to borrow books as I chose , and I have been constantly in and out .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 16]: I could not undertake to say positively what I did on any particular day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 4]: `` Ruth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 14]: Ruth lifted a miserable face , and shot a glance across the room .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 22]: There was none of Mollie 's righteous indignation in that glance , only a nervous shrinking which amounted almost to fear .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 12]: `` I -- I was in the library , Uncle Bernard !
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: I photographed it several times that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 21]: It seemed a good opportunity , as you were upstairs , and I wanted the room for my collection . ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 5]: `` You were photographing .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 15]: That means that you would be some little time alone in the room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 10]: `` Yes -- no ; I came and went .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 10]: Not so very long , '' stammered Ruth hesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 24]: It was terrible to be cross-examined like this , with the eyes of the three men fixed upon her , grave and questioning .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 14]: She looked wistfully at the door , and half rose from her seat .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 9]: `` I know nothing -- I did nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 7]: I can tell you nothing more !
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 5]: May I go now ?
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 9]: There is no use staying any longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 6]: `` One moment , please !
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 37]: You all deny having touched the will , and I shall , of course , accept your word ; but you must help to find the real culprit by giving me every clue in your power .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 11]: Was any reference made to the will in your presence ?
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 15]: Has anyone , for instance , expressed curiosity respecting it and its contents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 18]: Victor 's eyes turned to Ruth with a glance which brought the colour rushing into her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 15]: He did not speak , but his expression was too eloquent to be misread .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 35]: The old man looked keenly from one to the other , and his voice took an added sharpness as he spoke -- `` Well , Druce , out with it -- out with it !
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 10]: What is it that you have to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 9]: `` Nothing , sir -- nothing worth repeating .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 20]: Your question reminded me of a chance remark ; but I would rather say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 8]: `` You have said too much already .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 10]: Pray go on , since you have begun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 10]: cried Ruth , with a sudden blaze of anger .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 26]: Her small head was thrown back with a defiant gesture , and the Farrell eyebrows met in a straight black line across her brow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 21]: _ I _ spoke of your will , Uncle Bernard -- I said I wished that I could see it .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 9]: I _ did _ want to see it !
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 17]: It was impossible to know that it was lying there , and not feel curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 6]: `` Of course it was .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 22]: We were all curious , but some of us had not the honesty to confess it , '' Jack cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 15]: `` Surely it is not necessary to keep Miss Ruth any longer , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 13]: She has told you that she can give you no more information .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 35]: It is cruel to the girl -- '' He broke off as if afraid of speaking too strongly ; and Mr Farrell lay back in his chair with a sudden weary slackening of muscle .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 14]: `` Yes , yes , she may go ; you may all go !
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 17]: We can prove nothing at present ; but time will show -- time will show ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 11]: And he raised his hand with a gesture of dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 21]: Ruth and Victor rose and hurriedly left the room only Jack stood his ground , nervously tugging at his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 34]: He had something to say , and was determined to say it , but the sight of the old man 's figure in its physical and mental depression turned his anger into commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 13]: It was in almost an apologetic voice that he broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 18]: `` I stayed because I wanted to have five minutes ' quiet talk with you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 16]: My ankle is now practically well , and I am anxious to return to town .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 35]: Please do n't think I am unappreciative of your kindness in wishing me to stay , but as I said before I have no wish to be considered as a candidate for your fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 21]: It is owing to my accident that I have remained so long , and not to any change of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 44]: I hear from my partner that the business is suffering from my absence , and we have had such a struggle to work it up to its present condition , that you can understand I am in a fever to get back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 15]: Contrary to his expectation Mr Farrell showed no sign either of surprise or anger .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 28]: Perhaps he had been expecting the announcement as a result of convalescence , perhaps he was simply too weary to feel any strong interest in passing events .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 51]: In any case , his face scarcely changed in expression , as he replied -- `` After five weeks ' visit to the Court you still keep to your original opinion , that the chance of possessing it is not worth a little inconvenience , or even monetary loss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 9]: Jack pursed his lips with an impatient dissent .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 15]: `` Oh , the Court is beautiful -- an ideal place in every respect .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 16]: I would go through a good deal to earn it -- in a straightforward fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 18]: What I object to is the mystery , and the idleness , and the feeling of competition .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 25]: You have every right to manage your own affairs in your own way , sir , but you must allow me the same privilege .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 20]: You must have found out by this time that I have a large amount of obstinacy in my composition .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 20]: I have made up my mind that for every reason it is my duty to return to town . ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 38]: `` You have calculated , of course , that even if your business succeeds to an extraordinary extent , you are never likely to make anything like as much money as will come to my heir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 11]: `` I have always heard that you are enormously wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 53]: You are probably quite right ; but , '' -- Jack paused in front of the lounge-chair and looked down at the shrunken figure from the height of six-foot-one , -- `` looking back on your own life , sir , has your greatest happiness come from the amount of your possessions ?
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 7]: Has it increased as they increased ?
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 16]: Can you honestly advise me as a young man to sacrifice everything for money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 26]: There was silence for several minutes , while Mr Farrell winced and shrank within himself , as if the words had touched a hidden sore .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 42]: He never referred to his own domestic life ; but it was well-known that for years it had been one of ideal happiness , and that with the loss of wife and son , his real life had closed for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 15]: He avoided a direct reply to Jack 's question by asking another in return .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 12]: `` There are other things which many men consider more important .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 11]: I have sometimes imagined that you would agree with them .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 30]: Have you reflected that in returning to town you may be leaving behind even more than land or fortune , and thereby losing a dearer chance of happiness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 8]: The blood rushed into Jack 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 35]: He could not affect to misunderstand the drift of the old man 's words , but to acknowledge their truth was impossible , and the orthodox protests seemed to come of their own accord .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 5]: What am I leaving ?
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 10]: I hardly understand ... '' Mr Farrell laughed shortly .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 19]: `` Young people seem to imagine that their elders can not see what is happening under their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 23]: I have watched you and Mollie , and thought that there might possibly be an interesting _ denouement _ to your friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 18]: She has faults , but she has a kind heart and would make a good wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 5]: Jack 's face stiffened .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 15]: `` Had n't we better keep her name out of the discussion , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 33]: I have the greatest respect and admiration for both your nieces , but , as far as anything further is concerned , I am not in a position to think of marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 22]: It may be years before I can keep a house , and I would never tie down a girl indefinitely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 17]: `` In this instance it might happen that the girl had a house of her own !
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 19]: Did it never strike you that you would be doubling your chances if you linked them together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 9]: `` I am not a fool , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 21]: Of course I realised as much from the first , and have wondered if it was part of your scheme .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 21]: My idea of marriage , however , is to be able to keep my wife , not to accept support .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 39]: It may be a weakness in my nature , which makes me wish to be head of my own household ; but weakness or not , there it is , and I ca n't get rid of it .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 34]: It would be detestable to me to marry an heiress , and if I were a girl I should despise a man who was content to live on his wife 's money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 7]: `` Just so -- just so !
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 22]: Very praiseworthy sentiments , no doubt ; but I should have been glad to know that the child had a protector .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 35]: The stepfather is a broken reed , and the mother is a child herself ; however , you place your pride and your prejudice first , and that 's the end of the business .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 18]: You will go back to town , she to the North -- a very effectual separation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 46]: He shrugged his shoulders expressively ; but Jack 's eyes gave out a sudden flash , he straightened himself , and cried eagerly -- `` There are trains , there are boats -- if it comes to that , it is only two hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 12]: If she were in trouble , one could _ walk _ !
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 31]: It would make no difference if the woman one wanted were at the end of the world -- one would get to her _ somehow _ when the hour arrived !
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 13]: Difficulty is an inspiration , sir , when one is young ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 16]: `` Yes , yes ; when one is young -- when one is young ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 20]: The smile which had lightened the old man 's face died away at the sound of those last words .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 13]: He raised his hand and pushed the thin locks from his brow .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 18]: `` Well , it is your own life -- you must live it in your own way !
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 9]: I can not benefit you against your will .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 15]: If your mind is made up I have no strength to argue the point .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 20]: You had better arrange to leave to-morrow afternoon , and give instructions to that effect to the servants . ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 9]: Jack 's start of surprise was entirely disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 32]: He had not expected to be dismissed in this summary fashion , and the thought of so speedy a break with the new life came upon him with a positive shock .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 2]: To-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 76]: To-morrow , then , at this very hour he would be back in the dingy lodgings which did duty for home , preparing to sit down to a solitary meal , to spend a solitary evening , to sleep and wake up to a day 's work in the stifling City , where the thought of green fields and rose - gardens , and wide , stretching lawns would seem as unreal as a dream .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 15]: A weight of depression settled on him , as he exclaimed -- `` To-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 22]: But -- unless you wish it , there is no hurry -- I could wait until the end of the week .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 15]: If I left on Saturday , I could still begin work on Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 5]: `` For what object ?
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 21]: Since you have decided not to remain , it is better for all reasons that you should return at once .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 18]: You have put your work before everything else -- then why delay in getting back to it ?
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 24]: For my own part , since you refuse to consent to my conditions , it would simplify matters if you returned at once .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: The position is difficult , and my strength is rapidly failing .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 40]: I should have been glad if you had consented to grant me these few weeks out of your life , but , since it is not to be , I prefer to finish the matter once for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 9]: He held out his hand as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 9]: `` Good-bye , Melland -- my best wishes !
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 10]: I shall not see you in the morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 21]: Jack took the proffered hand , and held it in silence , his face a study of perplexity and remorse .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 22]: An Englishman hates to express his emotions , but to a generous nature the sting of ungratefulness is even more abhorrent .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 27]: At that moment it seemed a little thing to spare a few months of strong , young life to gratify the whim of a dying man .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 13]: Jack 's heart reproached him , and he spoke in eager accents .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 64]: `` If I could be a help to you , sir -- if I felt that my presence gave you pleasure or comfort , I would stay willingly as long as you wished ; but you have kept so much apart , that there has been no opportunity -- '' Mr Farrell disengaged his hand , and turned aside with a wearied air .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 6]: `` Good-bye , Melland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 9]: `` I wish you a pleasant journey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 23]: So far as any change of voice or manner was concerned , he might not have heard the young man 's protest .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 8]: Jack turned away , miserable and abashed .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 12]: It was the last time he ever saw Bernard Farrell alive .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 7]: FRESH TRIALS FOR RUTH AND MOLLIE .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 42]: Meanwhile , Ruth and Mollie were crying in each other 's arms in the privacy of their bedroom -- that is to say , Ruth was crying and Mollie was storming and shedding an occasional tear more of anger than distress .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 23]: `` I 've never been so insulted in my life , and I wo n't stand it from fifty thousand Uncle Bernards !
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 18]: I 'll tell him so , and make him beg my pardon and yours too , darling !
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 4]: Do n't cry !
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 16]: It makes your nose so red , and you hate to look a fright ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 20]: `` Oh , Mollie , we were far happier at home when we thought we were so badly off !
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 13]: What was the use of coming here to have our hearts broken ?
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 19]: I loved that man , I thought he loved me , and now I can only despise him .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 40]: He deliberately tried to fasten suspicion upon me this afternoon , and I can never prove my innocence , for I _ was _ in the library , and alone for quite a long time , on and off .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 17]: What can I do , or say , if they wo n't take my word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 33]: `` Everybody will , whose opinion is worth having Victor Druce thinks of nothing but his own advantage ; and I wo n't allow you to say you cared for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 8]: `` It 's easier said than done !
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 7]: Can you practise what you preach ?
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 15]: You do n't say anything , but I know , -- I can see !
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 17]: When Jack goes away , will you find it easy to forget all about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 5]: Mollie 's face changed .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 13]: Excitement disappeared , to be replaced by a sweet and serious dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 39]: `` I shall never forget him , '' she said quietly ; `` but he is in love with another girl -- he told me about her the other day -- so our lives must be spent apart .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 24]: I shall never be as happy as I might have been , but I 'm going to be as happy as I can .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 7]: I _ wo n't _ mope !
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 31]: We were happy enough just to be together a few weeks ago ; let 's go back to where we were , and forget all about the tiresome men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 14]: `` It 's easier said than done , '' sighed Ruth once more .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 34]: She sank down in a chair by the window , and , leaning her head on her hand , gazed drearily across the park , beautiful in the changing light of late afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 43]: With what joy and confidence had she regarded the same scene a few weeks ago , her heart expanding in the happy certainty that some day it would be her own , and with it unlimited powers of helping those she loved .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 31]: Now , between Victor 's faithlessness and her own fall from favour , hope had gradually died away , and the future seemed to hold nothing but bitterness and regret .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 9]: Ruth 's heart turned homewards with yearning affection .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 46]: The love of the little mother was a certainty which could be depended upon through good report and ill ; nothing that could be said against her child would shake her trust and faith , she would be even more tender in failure than success .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 39]: The dear old pater , too -- how good he had been all these years , making no distinction between his step-daughters and his own children , except perhaps to show a more anxious care for their needs !
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 28]: He worked so hard , and was so absolutely self-denying and uncomplaining ; it was not his fault if he did not possess the power of money-making .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 20]: When she was at home again she would be more thoughtful of his comfort , more affectionate and sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 27]: She recalled all the step-brothers and sisters whose very existence she had grudged at times , each name bringing with it some kindly , humorous recollection .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: How truly lovable they were , despite their faults !
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 28]: Then Ruth 's thoughts roamed a little further afield to the few intimate friends of the family , foremost among whom came Eleanor Maclure and her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 13]: What would Eleanor say if the grand expedition ended in ignominious failure ?
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 39]: A good many words of sympathy , of cheer , and a few simple heart-to-heart truths , pointing out the spiritual side of the puzzle , spoken in that soft Scotch voice which was so good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 13]: Ah yes , it would be a help to meet Eleanor again .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 6]: And the -- the doctor !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 91]: During the first weeks of her stay at the Court , Ruth had been so much absorbed in the present that she had had no leisure to think of old friends ; but during the last few days the vision of Dr Maclure 's face had risen before her not once but many times -- strong , earnest , resolute , with steady glance and square-built chin , such a contrast from that other face with the veiled eyes , which seemed to hide rather than reveal the soul within .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 30]: In the midst of soreness and humiliation it had been a comfort to remember that such a man had loved her enough to wish to make her his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 13]: She recalled the conversation in the brougham with new sympathy and understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 9]: Had he suffered as she was suffering now ?
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 18]: Did his life also stretch ahead blank and grey because of that little word from her lips ?
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 14]: Her heart yearned over him , yet felt mysteriously lightened at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 9]: `` There 's the postman 's collie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: cried Mollie 's voice , interrupting her reverie .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 10]: `` That means that the evening post is in .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 13]: I 'll run down and see what there is for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 16]: She disappeared for a few minutes , then reappeared carrying one letter in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: `` From mother , to you .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 6]: Open it quickly , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 9]: It is an age since she has written .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 11]: I only hope and pray it is good news ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 13]: that aspiration was shattered at the sight of the first few sentences .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 30]: `` My darling girls , -- I have delayed writing as I could not bear to cloud your pleasure , but I can keep back the truth no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 25]: You must be brave , dears , and help me to be brave , for it is no half and half trouble this time .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 18]: We are quite , quite ruined , and Heaven only knows what is to become of us !
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 13]: `` It is not the pater 's fault in any one way .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 26]: For the last two years he has been doing a good deal of business for a man who appeared to be in very good circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 25]: At first he paid up his accounts most regularly , but lately they have sometimes been allowed to run on from month to month .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 64]: I do n't understand business , but it seems that this is often allowed , and as he had been such a good client , and had met his payments regularly before , the pater felt safe in trusting him , and paid out all his own little capital to finance the business of the last few months , which was unusually large .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 26]: `` He expected to make such a handsome commission as would set us on our feet again ; but it was all a deliberate fraud .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 25]: Other poor men have been taken in in the same way , and that scoundrel has disappeared , leaving us to bear the brunt .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 38]: I hope I may be able to forgive him some day ; just now , when I see the pater 's broken heart and think of you , and all those children , it 's too difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 31]: `` Everything that we have or can raise in any way will not pay what we owe , and the pater can not carry on his business without some capital .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 23]: The future is very dark ; but God has helped me through many dark days , and He will help us still .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 4]: Trix is splendid !
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 33]: She went of her own accord to the headmistress and offered to teach one of the junior classes in exchange for Betty 's education , and a few finishing classes for herself .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 31]: Miss Bean came to see me , and it is all arranged , for she says Trix has a genius for managing children , and will be a valuable help .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 34]: She is a good woman , and is glad of the opportunity of helping us , so that difficulty is overcome ; but there are oh , so many others to be faced !
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 15]: `` What is to be done about the house -- the boys -- yourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 27]: Pater and I have talked until we are too tired and puzzled to talk any more , but , so far , no light has dawned .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 25]: `` Write to the pater as well as to me , for he has been good to you , and will value your sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 21]: Oh , my darlings , it is hard that this should have happened just now to spoil your happy visit !
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 18]: My heart aches for your trouble , for these things are so hard when one is young .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 31]: I hope , I trust , I pray that the future may be so bright for you as to make up for all the anxieties you have had to bear .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 17]: Tell Uncle Bernard our trouble ; you and he must decide what you had better do .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 18]: `` I long for your help and comfort , but leave the decision entirely in your hands .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 21]: Every one is good and sympathetic , and the pater has had most kind letters from his friends in town .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 24]: We have this great comfort that his good name is untarnished , and that there is no shadow of disgrace in our misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: God bless you , my darlings !
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 18]: If we are rich in nothing else , we are rich in our love for one another .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 6]: -- Your devoted Mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 13]: The girls looked at each other in a long , breathless silence .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 14]: Ruth laid her hand across her heart with a little gasp of pain .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 5]: `` Oh , mother !
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 4]: Poor little mother !
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 13]: And we are away , we who should be her best comforters !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 17]: There is only one thing to do , -- we must go home at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' assented Mollie firmly , `` we must go home to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 4]: A FATEFUL DECISION .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 5]: It was all decided .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 25]: The interview with Uncle Bernard was over , the last farewells spoken , and the boxes packed in readiness to go to the station .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 18]: In less than an hour the Court and its inhabitants would be a thing of the past .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 25]: Out of consideration for Mr Farrell 's health , the girls had decided not to tell him of their bad news until the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 21]: `` He has had enough excitement for one day , '' Mollie said ; `` let him be quiet to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 26]: To-morrow morning we will send up mother 's letter for him to read , and ask to see him as soon as possible after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 16]: That will give him time to think over the situation and decide what to do .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 24]: He must guess that we will want to return home , but if he wishes to keep us he can easily do so .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 20]: Oh , to think that with a few strokes of the pen he could make us all happy again !
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 27]: I do n't know how much money the pater needs , but it would probably be the tiniest sum out of Uncle Bernard 's great fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 25]: Suppose he offered to send a cheque -- suppose he gave us a cheque to send , and all was peace and joy again !
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 14]: He could -- he might -- oh , surely he _ will _ !
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 17]: What is the use of being rich if one ca n't help people in trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 8]: But Ruth sighed and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 22]: `` Rich people have not much patience with failures , and the poor old pater has not the gift of success .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 16]: I am afraid Uncle Bernard will be more inclined to blame than to help . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 8]: And as events proved she was right .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 45]: Mr Farrell sent word that he would be at liberty at ten o'clock in the sitting-room adjoining his bedroom , and the first few minutes of the interview proved that his attitude towards the family trouble was one of scornful impatience rather than sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 21]: He was apparently quite unprepared for the girls , determination , and would not at first believe in its sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 11]: `` You are surely joking , '' he said scathingly .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 30]: `` If your parents are in such straits as you describe , how do you propose to help them by giving them two more people to keep and feed ?
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 16]: It appears to me that your room would be more valuable than your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 4]: Ruth flushed painfully .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 13]: `` We hope to be able to help , not to hinder .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 17]: When a child like Trix has already found work , we ought not to lag behind .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 39]: It would be impossible to go on living in the lap of luxury , wearing fine clothes , eating fine meals , being waited upon hand and foot , while our own people are in actual need . ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 20]: `` Unless -- '' interrupted Mollie , and then stopped short , while Mr Farrell turned sharply towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: `` Unless what ?
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 9]: Finish your sentence , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 10]: `` Unless you will help them for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 8]: gasped Mollie , crimson , but daring .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 30]: `` It would be so easy for you to lend the pater what he needs , and he would promise to pay you back -- we would all promise !
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 13]: We would work night and day until it was made up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 5]: Mr Farrell smiled sardonically .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 4]: `` At last !
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 6]: I knew it must come .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 17]: It would not be Mollie if she had any scruples about asking for what she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 9]: No , my dear , I never lend .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 12]: It is against my principles to throw good money after bad .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 21]: At the risk of appearing a monster of cruelty , I must refuse to interfere in your stepfather 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 44]: There are still six weeks of your visit here to run , and I shall be pleased to relieve him of your support for that time ; otherwise -- '' `` We are much obliged , but we have decided to go home .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 36]: You wished to be able to judge our characters , and you have had enough time to do so , with very unsatisfactory results , if we are to judge from yesterday 's conversation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 10]: cried Ruth , with a sudden burst of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 27]: `` If you can believe us capable of prying into your desk , you will surely not be sorry to get rid of us altogether ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 10]: The old man looked at her long and thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 28]: `` Yes , '' he said quietly , `` it 's a pity -- a very great pity -- that the two things should have happened together .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 20]: It is as unsatisfactory to me as to you that you should leave before the culprit has been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 17]: But it is useless now to argue the point if your minds are already made up .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 34]: Taking everything into consideration -- the peculiar circumstances with regard to my will , your original acceptance of my invitation -- do I still understand that you wish to leave me to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 9]: `` It is our duty to go home .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 11]: Yes , we have quite decided , '' said Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: The old man 's eyes turned towards the younger girl .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 7]: `` And you , Mollie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 20]: `` Yes , uncle ; I 'm sorry , but we ca n't leave mother alone just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 41]: Mr Farrell sat silent , his eyebrows lowered , his head hanging forward on his chest , so that it was difficult to see the expression of his face ; but the pose of the figure suggested weariness and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 12]: Suddenly he stretched out his hand and touched an electric bell .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 23]: A servant appeared almost immediately , and was asked a hasty question -- `` Is Mr Druce still in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 7]: `` I believe so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 11]: He was in the morning-room a few minutes ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 21]: `` Go down and tell him that I should be obliged if he would come up here at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 47]: The girls exchanged puzzled glances as the servant departed on his errand ; but they did not dare to speak , and , as Mr Farrell relapsed into his former downcast attitude , the silence was broken only by the sound of Victor 's approaching footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 22]: He entered the room confident and smiling , but drew up with a start of surprise at seeing the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 26]: He was evidently disappointed at their presence , and vaguely uneasy ; but after the first involuntary movement his features quickly resumed their mask-like calm .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 8]: `` You sent for me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 8]: Is there anything I can do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 11]: Mr Farrell raised his head and looked at him thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 29]: It was seldom indeed that he allowed himself to show any sign of interest in his young companions , so that this steady scrutiny was the more remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 27]: Even Victor 's composure suffered beneath it , for a tinge of colour crept into his pale cheeks , and he moved uneasily to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 8]: `` What is it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 12]: `` I hope nothing fresh has happened to distress you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 6]: `` Thank you , Druce .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 30]: My plans have been still further upset this morning , as , owing to news received from home , my nieces have decided to leave the Court at once .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 28]: That means that three out of the four whom I selected for my experiment have , of their own accord , refused to carry out the conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 30]: Under these circumstances , I think it is only right to offer to release you from your promise , if you prefer to return home at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 21]: Everything will be changed , and you may not care to stay on with only myself as a companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 15]: Victor 's eyelids dropped , and a quiver of emotion passed over his face .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 20]: Ruth saw it , and , with a sinking heart , realised that it resembled exultation rather than grief .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 86]: He was silent for a moment , but when he spoke nothing could well have been more dignified and natural than words and manner -- `` If it will inconvenience you in any way to entertain me alone , I am , of course , perfectly ready to leave ; but if you give me the choice -- if it is left to me to decide , sir -- I should prefer to keep my promise , and stay for the remainder of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 15]: I might perhaps be of some help to you when you are alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 16]: The strained expression on Mr Farrell 's face gave place to one of unmistakable satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 6]: `` That is good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 4]: he replied heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 20]: `` I am glad to find that you at least have some appreciation of the nature of a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 17]: It will be lonely for you , but I am the more obliged for your decision .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 28]: I wo n't keep you any longer just now , as we shall have other opportunities of conversation , and I have my adieux to make . ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 25]: The door closed behind Victor , and Mr Farrell turned immediately towards his eldest grand-niece , as if anxious to get through an ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 11]: `` Well , Ruth , I must bid you good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 21]: I trust you will have a pleasant journey , and find matters at home less serious than you anticipate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 8]: `` Thank you , Uncle Bernard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 31]: Ruth extended a cold little hand , and stood hesitating by his side , while his sunken eyes dwelt upon the face which in feature was so like his own .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 20]: `` I 've enjoyed the time -- part of the time -- more than anything else in my life !
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 20]: I 'm sorry if I have done wrong in any way ; I wanted only to please you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 14]: `` For my own sake , or for what I could give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 15]: The question came sharp and abrupt , and Ruth 's cheeks flamed beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 11]: She hesitated painfully , gathering courage to speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 10]: `` Oh , I know I have been mercenary !
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 19]: I 'm sick of being poor , and I love the Court and the easy , luxurious life .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 34]: I wanted the money more than anything in the world ; but it 's all over now , and it 's partly your own fault , for you _ did _ tempt me !
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 8]: Please forgive me before I go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 7]: `` I forgive you , Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 18]: It is quite true that I tempted you , and you are not fitted to bear temptation .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 9]: But there is no need to bear enmity .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 32]: He held out his hand again -- held it at a distance , and with a formality which forbade a warmer farewell ; and Ruth turned away , downcast and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 49]: Those words , `` You are not fitted to bear temptation , '' seemed to denote that in his mind there still dwelt a lingering suspicion lest she might have yielded to her anxiety to look at the will , and had then lacked the courage for confession .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 14]: Well , it was all over , and it was useless to protest .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 5]: So perish earthly hopes !
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 8]: Mr Farrell turned towards his remaining niece .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 16]: `` Well , Mollie , and so you also are resolved to leave me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 15]: `` There was only one alternative , Uncle Bernard , and you refused it .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 17]: If you wo n't help mother , we must lose no time in getting to work .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 8]: We are breaking no promise , remember .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 26]: We said we would stay if she could spare us , and now the time has come when she needs to have us back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 25]: `` You believe you can find work -- work which will pay -- a child like you , with the plainest of educations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 7]: `` I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 16]: I am not going to teach , but I shall be able to do something .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 19]: I should be ashamed of myself if I could n't -- a big , strong creature like me !
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 14]: I am sorry to go -- much more sorry than you will believe !
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 10]: I 've been very happy these few weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 6]: `` I know you have .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 12]: I have known more than you are aware of , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 20]: But you will not regret your departure so much , as Jack Melland is leaving at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 11]: He has been your special companion , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 38]: The blood flew to Mollie 's cheeks under the scrutiny of the sunken eyes , and , to her consternation , spread even higher and higher , until she was crimson to the roots of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 22]: She tried in vain to answer with composure , but could only stammer confusedly -- `` He has been very nice .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 11]: I like him the best -- better than Mr Druce .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 23]: But he decided -- we decided , -- our reasons for leaving are absolutely independent of each other , Uncle Bernard . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 8]: `` I know -- I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 32]: He turned aside , and remained silent for a few minutes , as if to allow her time to recover composure , then once more held out his hand in farewell .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 7]: `` Well , good-bye , Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 10]: We also must agree to forgive and forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 42]: Mollie bent over his chair , one hand resting on each arm , the embarrassment of a moment before dying a sudden death in the face of a parting which , in the nature of things , must be for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 37]: `` Uncle Bernard , '' she said softly , `` if your Ned were alive , and you were in trouble , you would like him to hurry home to you , whatever it might cost !
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 32]: And if She were alive , and poor and distraught , you would rather he worked for her , than left her that he might fill the greatest post on earth .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 13]: Judge us by that thought when you feel inclined to be hard !
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 18]: I know you do n't like kissing people , so I am going to kiss you instead .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 8]: Good-bye ; and God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 24]: She turned away with tears in her eyes , but half-way to the door the sound of her own name made her pause .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 4]: `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 19]: he cried , in a sharp , resolute voice , which sent her heart beating with sudden hope .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 15]: But , even as her eyes met his , his expression changed once more .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 12]: `` No , no ; it is better as it is !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 7]: I have nothing to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 11]: Mollie turned away sadly and walked out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 4]: LEAVING THE COURT .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 35]: The news of the girls ' sudden flight spread to the vicarage , and brought Mrs Thornton rushing up to the Court , hot and panting , and almost incoherent with curiosity and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 36]: When she heard of the trouble which was the cause of their departure , her best side came out , and she helped the girls in both word and deed through the last difficult hours .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 34]: It was a comfort to find someone who agreed with their decision , and was convinced that they were acting aright in returning home , even in defiance of Uncle Bernard 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 50]: `` The maid cries , and Bates looks as if he would like to murder us , Mr Druce keeps out of the way and says nothing , and Jack Melland , who is so keen on taking his own way , has half a dozen compromises to suggest .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 22]: Actually he offered to go to Liverpool himself and find out if we could be of any use if we returned !
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 13]: It was sweet of him , but we must be of use .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 25]: There is no option in the matter , and it is not reasonable to expect mother to discuss private affairs with a stranger . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 14]: `` Of course not ; but I love him for having suggested it .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 13]: Of course , no one wants you to go , dear Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 36]: It is a terrible collapse to all our bright schemes , but with such trouble at home you have no choice , and there is nothing gained by staying on for a few odd days .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 32]: Better hurry back and bend all your energies to see what can be done to retrieve matters , and look forward to the day when you will return for good . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 14]: Ruth shook her head hopelessly , and for once Mollie followed her example .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 8]: `` Ah , that will never be !
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 6]: There is no more hope .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 43]: We are leaving against Uncle Bernard 's wishes , and at the very worst possible time , for he is angry and upset because there is no way of finding out who opened the desk and read the draft of the will .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 20]: We are all indignant at being suspected ; yet it seems strange that an outsider should be so interested .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 38]: It is terribly unfortunate , especially for Uncle Bernard , for he ca n't help feeling his confidence shaken ; and yet , so far as we can see , nothing will ever be found out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 17]: `` Yes , it will all be explained some day , '' said Mrs Thornton solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 13]: `` Do n't ask me how , for I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 38]: I only know that evil deeds are the most difficult things in the world to hide , and that in the most wonderful and unexpected ways they are discovered long after hope of detection has been abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 9]: It will be so in this case also .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 34]: Whoever is mean and wicked enough to allow you , dear children , to bear an unjust suspicion in addition to your own trouble , will be put to the shame he deserves .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 17]: As for your coming back again , I will not give up hope if you do .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 13]: I ca n't afford to lose all my castles in the air .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 51]: It is decided that one of you is to be Lady of the Manor , and put our societies out of debt , and pay for a parish nurse , and take my dear girls about when they come home , and make life a fairy tale for us all .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 14]: You have raised my expectations , and I intend to go on expecting !
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 45]: Seriously , dears , whatever Mr Farrell may say to you just now , in the first heat of disappointment , I can not believe he will really think less of you for giving up your own pleasure to hurry back to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 32]: Mr Melland has only himself to thank if his name is struck off the list ; but you were willing and anxious to stay , and are the victims of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 38]: If I were in the squire 's place I should think all the more highly of you for your unselfish devotion , and I believe he will , though he will never confess as much in words .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 5]: But time will show !
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 34]: Meantime , my poor dears , we will think of you every day , and pray for you that you may be shown what to do , and have strength to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 28]: I have had my own share of money troubles , and would never try to belittle them in my own case or in the case of others .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 12]: They are very hard and sordid , and far - reaching .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 45]: There was a time in my life when money seemed in the background of every thought , and I could not get away from it ; but I have learnt to trust instead of worrying , and that 's the great lesson of life .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 45]: It is n't mastered in a day ; it took me years to learn , and many bitter experiences , which I hope you may be spared ; but try , dears , to do your best , and leave the rest with God !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 20]: Then comes the ` quiet mind ' which will keep you calm and restful through all outward troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 19]: The two young , wistful faces gazed into hers , and her eyes filled with tears of pity .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 21]: `` Now tell me honestly -- shall I help you best by staying , or by going away at once ?
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 10]: I have arranged to do whichever suits you best .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 7]: If you need any help . ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 6]: `` Oh , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 18]: The best help of all would be to stay and drive down to the station with us .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 10]: The packing is all done -- in a way !
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 36]: But I expect that in our haste we have left lots of things behind , for we worked together , and in such a hurry and confusion that we hardly knew what we were about .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 18]: Poor Elsie has packed our new garments in the new trunks , and watered them with tears .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 11]: I expect it will be months before they are opened .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 11]: We shall have no use for such fineries now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 22]: `` You can never tell what may happen , but if you do n't , there is no cause to grieve .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 12]: They have served their day , and have given you pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 16]: Never mind if you have left some oddments behind ; Elsie can send them on .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 28]: I never have a visitor at the vicarage that I have not to expend my substance posting toothbrushes or sponge-bags or stray garments after their departure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 20]: Truth to tell , Mrs Thornton was much relieved at being allowed to accompany the girls to the station .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 29]: The Vicar 's wife possessed even more than her share of feminine curiosity , and was longing to discover in what fashion Victor Druce said good-bye to Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 63]: He was already waiting in the dining-room when she went down with the girls a few minutes later to partake of some light refreshment before starting on their long journey , and nothing could have been more unobtrusively sympathetic or attentive than the manner in which he waited upon them , anticipating every want , and ministering to it with eager hands .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 36]: The room itself was so spacious that unconsciously the little party split into groups ; and Mrs Thornton found herself _ tete-a - tete _ with Jack Melland , obviously in the worst of humours .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 6]: `` Can you do nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 17]: Is there nothing you can say to knock a little common-sense into those girls ' heads ?
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 19]: It 's the maddest trick , rushing off like this in defiance of the old man 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 14]: What can they do at home -- a couple of children like that ?
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 8]: They are better out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 29]: At any rate , one of them might have stayed -- Mollie , for instance -- and kept things going here till she saw how things worked out .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 15]: They have no right to rush off together at a moment 's notice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 10]: he cried irritably ; whereat Mrs Thornton smiled involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 16]: `` Is n't it rather a case of people in glass houses , Mr Melland ?
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 15]: You have set a bad example without half the excuse of these dear girls .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 31]: It seems to me their plain duty to return to their parents when they are in trouble , so I have not attempted to dissuade them in any way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 19]: `` But -- '' Jack made a slight but eloquent gesture of the head in Victor 's direction .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 11]: `` It 's such a walk over for somebody else !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 9]: I ca n't bear the thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 17]: This place ought to belong to one of those girls -- it is theirs by rights .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 28]: It maddens me to see them throwing away their chance , for I 'm afraid Mr Farrell will never forgive them for going against his wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 8]: `` Do n't be too sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 9]: returned Mrs Thornton , nodding her head sagely .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 52]: `` Mr Farrell is not half so obstinate as he pretends , and however annoyed he may be to-day he ca n't help softening when he remembers that they have put all their own pleasures and self-interests on one side to return to work and worry for their mother 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 16]: If he wanted a test of character , surely nothing could be better than this !
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 19]: I do n't think it will be by any means a ` walk over ' for Mr Druce .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 23]: My firm belief is , that Ruth and Mollie have as good or even a better chance than they had before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 18]: `` I say , '' cried Jack cordially , `` you _ are _ a brick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 18]: He turned towards her with a bright , boyish smile , which took years off his age .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 14]: `` You do n't know how you have cheered me by saying that !
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 24]: I hated to think of them as being out of the running ; but you will rub it in , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 11]: Do n't let Druce have it all his own way !
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 23]: Impress upon the old fellow what you said just now -- unselfishness and hard work , and all that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 28]: You will know how to do it , so as to make him see that he ought to admire the girls more for going than staying . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 5]: Mrs Thornton smiled indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 8]: `` I can try , at least .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 14]: I 'm only sorry that I ca n't do the same for you .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 29]: You have not the excuse of home troubles , and I 'm afraid Mr Farrell -- '' `` Oh , never mind me ; I do n't count !
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 25]: I have been out of the running from the first , and it is only through an accident that I have stayed so long .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 15]: I do n't want anything from Mr Farrell but good-feeling and a fair judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 15]: It cut me up to say good-bye when I saw how feeble he looked .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 45]: I do n't want you to plead my cause , because I relinquished my claim long ago ; but if you get a chance , you might just let him know that I was genuinely sorry to leave him for his own sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 27]: Jack 's manly , straightforward speech was just what Mrs Thornton expected from him , and she gladly consented to convey his message to Mr Farrell .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 24]: `` I will , with pleasure , '' she said , `` and I shall have the chance before many days are over .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 5]: Wonders will never cease !
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 24]: When I said just now that the squire was not so hard as he pretended , I spoke out of a full heart .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 33]: What do you think of his suggesting -- actually suggesting to my husband that the vicarage might need renovations , and asking him to send me up to give him my ideas !
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 9]: I nearly fainted when my husband told me .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 24]: Now , do you think he thought of it himself , or did one of you kind creatures suggest it to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 8]: `` I did n't , I know .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 26]: It would have been as much as my life was worth ; but I suspect Miss Mollie may have had something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 20]: She spoke pretty strongly on the subject to me , and she has the courage of her convictions . ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 7]: `` Oh , that Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 7]: murmured Mrs Thornton under her breath .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 8]: `` I have never met her equal .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 13]: The dearest , the simplest , the most affectionate of girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 28]: Her eyes moistened suddenly , and Jack 's face softened in sympathy as he looked across the room to where Mollie stood by her sister 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 22]: She met the two glances bent upon her , and walked forward in response , leaving Ruth and Victor by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 3]: Poor Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 21]: Her heart beat fast with agitation and a last desperate hope born of Victor 's soft tones and regretful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 48]: For the moment it seemed that the last few days must have been a nightmare , and that he really did `` care '' ; in which case she was prepared to forgive everything -- nay , more , to believe that there was nothing to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 36]: If , in this moment of trouble and humiliation , he would place himself by her side , nothing that she could do in the future would be enough to prove her gratitude and devotion .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 20]: even as Mollie turned away , Victor 's manner altered , and he became nervous and ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 36]: The long , eloquent glances which had been safe enough in the presence of a third person could not be risked in a _ tete-a-tete _ , and Ruth 's hopes died a final death .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 25]: She sat trying to eat her sandwiches , and feeling as if every bite would choke her , while Victor feebly struggled with commonplaces .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 23]: The sound of carriage-wheels could be heard drawing near to the door ; the last , the very last moment had arrived !
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 29]: Ruth raised her beautiful , sad face and gazed steadily at Victor , and he stopped short in the middle of a sentence , and turned guiltily aside .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 7]: He could not meet her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 80]: After that all was bustle and confusion -- servants crowding to say good - bye , villagers bobbing farewell curtseys at their doors , elaborate regrets and hopes for a speedy return from acquaintances at the little station , tears from Mrs Thornton , and a last glimpse of Victor 's tall figure standing motionless on the platform ; then they were off , and Jack tactfully busied himself behind his newspaper until the first painful moments were past .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 23]: When he ventured to lower the screen , both girls were perfectly composed and dry-eyed , gazing out of their respective windows .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 17]: His eyes turned from Ruth to dwell upon Mollie at the further end of the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 64]: The fashionable young woman had disappeared , and he saw again the simple girl in shabby serge coat and close-fitting hat with whom he had travelled weeks before , yet there was a difference which his fastidious eyes were quick to note , a dainty precision in the way the clothes were worn , a perfection of detail , a neatness of coiffure .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 27]: Mollie was too clever and adaptive to have missed the lessons of the last few weeks , and the change of expression was even more marked .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 35]: The audacious school-girl had disappeared , and in her place sat a woman , with a grave , set face , and eyes that stared into space , seeing things that were far away .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 10]: Jack 's heart contracted with a stab of pain .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 20]: He dropped his paper , and with one long step crossed the carriage and seated himself by her side .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 28]: Ruth turned in her seat to stare more persistently out of her window , and the clattering of the train made it impossible to overhear a conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 4]: `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 4]: said Jack softly .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 31]: She turned her head and looked at him , neither startled nor smiling , but with a patient sadness , the sight of which brought with it yet another stab .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 14]: `` For Heaven 's sake , Mollie , do n't look like that !
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 20]: Things will right themselves again , or you may find that they are not so bad as you expect .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 15]: In any case , there 's a pleasure in helping to pull them straight .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 19]: It may be a tug just at first , but that only means more satisfaction in the end .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 6]: Do n't look so sad !
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 12]: I ca n't bear to leave you looking like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 6]: Mollie gave a flickering smile .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 17]: She had not been thinking of business troubles , but naturally Jack could not guess that .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 10]: `` Once on a time -- do you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 9]: -- you wished that I could be serious .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 23]: You should not complain because your wish is fulfilled , '' she said slowly ; and Jack put up a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 3]: do n't !
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 5]: I was a fool !
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 9]: I did n't know what I was saying .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 21]: You were made to be happy ; you should always be happy if I could arrange it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 11]: Mollie smiled again , but with the same obvious effort .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 25]: `` I hope you will be happy , '' she said ; `` I hope some day we may hear good news from you .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 15]: I do n't mean about money ; you can guess what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 41]: `` Yes , '' said Jack gravely ; and there was silence for another five minutes , while the train approached nearer and nearer to the junction at which he was to alight , to catch the express for town .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 19]: `` I hope I shall hear good news of you , too , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 42]: `` You will be busy at first , and there may not be much to tell , but later on -- in a few weeks ' time , when you see how things are going -- will you let me know ?
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 48]: I shall be so interested to hear ; and at any time if I can do anything , if you need anything done in town , or if I could help by coming North , you would be doing me a good turn by letting me know .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 16]: I mean it , Mollie ; it is not a polite form of speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 29]: `` I know ; thank you ; I will promise , '' said Mollie , with , for the first time , a little break in her composure .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 29]: Her lip trembled in a pathetic , childlike fashion , and , as if afraid of herself , she bent forward and addressed a pointed question to Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 19]: Ten minutes later the junction was reached , and Jack stood outside the carriage saying his last farewells .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 25]: Ruth talked persistently in a high , cheerful voice , and Jack bit his moustache and cast furtive glances at Mollie 's white face .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 23]: She smiled at him bravely as the train steamed away , and waved her hand , calling out , `` Good luck !
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 4]: good luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 15]: Then they turned , the two poor girls , and clasped each other tightly .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 10]: `` Oh , Lucille , my poor Lucille ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 11]: `` Berengaria , Berengaria , how horribly it hurts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 4]: BACK TO POVERTY .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 34]: Trix was at the station to meet them -- a greatly developed Trix , as became a young woman who not only provided for her own education but also that of her sister .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 50]: The door-knocker had disappeared , and her lanky locks were screwed into a knot about as big as a good-sized walnut ; she wore a discarded black skirt of Ruth 's , which reached down to her ankles , a blue blouse , white sailor-hat , and brown shoes .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 20]: Ruth 's heart contracted with pain when she saw her , and even Mollie felt a pang of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 10]: So shabby , so unkempt , so obviously poverty-stricken !
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 23]: Was it really possible that Trix had looked like this six weeks before , and that the sight had caused no consternation ?
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 47]: Plainly Miss Trix was rather pleased than otherwise with her appearance , and was decidedly patronising to her half-sisters , ordering them about , and treating them with the lenient forbearance which a busy worker might be expected to show to two elderly , incapable drones .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 36]: She interviewed the porter as to sending home the luggage , and only consented to the hire of a cab when it was proved to her own satisfaction that the cost would be about equal .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 70]: She took Ruth 's purse from her hand to tip the porter , looking at him the while with such a severe and determined air that his grumbles died upon his lips ; finally , she gave the cabman instructions to stop at a certain shop , where -- as she informed her sisters triumphantly -- potatoes could be bought three-halfpence a peck cheaper than in more fashionable neighbourhoods .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 19]: `` Good gracious , Trix , you do n't mean to take home potatoes in the cab ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 51]: gasped Ruth , fresh from the delightful luxury of the Court , where no one thought what anything cost , and every luxury of the season appeared of its own accord upon the table ; but Trix smiled at her benignly , and replied -- `` Certainly ; two pecks !
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 10]: And any other vegetables I can pick up cheap .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 9]: It will help to pay for the cab-fare .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 27]: Not that you will get any of them to-night , for we have knocked off late dinner and afternoon-tea , and have one late tea instead .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 13]: Cold tongue for you to-night , as you have had a journey .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 7]: Mother wanted to have a chicken .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 3]: The idea !
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 19]: ` No , indeed , ' I said ; ` let them begin as they must go on .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 8]: Our chicken days are over ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: `` I think yours are , any way .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 16]: You seem to have grown into a very old hen , '' cried Mollie disconsolately .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 33]: She looked across the cab at the businesslike young woman , and wondered if a few weeks of home under the new conditions would work a similar transformation in herself and Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 40]: It was a comfort to remember that Trix 's vocation kept her out of the house for the greater part of the day , for it would be distinctly trying to be `` bossed '' as a permanent thing .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 20]: Perhaps Trix 's thoughts had wandered to the same subject , for her welcome was the reverse of encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 12]: `` Ca n't think what you 've come back for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 4]: she declared candidly .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 18]: `` Mother thought of sending for you last week , but I told her it was absurd .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 13]: It will make more work , and both the servants are going .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 24]: We gave Mary notice , and Kate said she could n't abase herself to be a ` general ' after her bringings up .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 7]: Goodness knows who we shall get !
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 31]: I sat for two hours in a registry-office yesterday afternoon , when we had a half-holiday , and did n't see a single creature who could be bribed to come .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 17]: ` Nine in family ; one servant , cellar kitchens ; washing done at home . '
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 8]: Sounds so attractive , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 12]: And yet I suppose we ought not to afford even one .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 16]: If we lived in the country we could do the work alone , but cockroaches !
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 30]: No really refined mind can cope with cockroaches , and they simply swarm in the back kitchen ... Mother 's terribly cut up that you have left the Court .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 27]: If I had been in your place I 'd have stayed on , and persuaded the old man to help father out of his difficulties . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 12]: `` Oh , Trix , as if we had n't tried !
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 12]: You talk as if no one had any sense but yourself !
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 20]: You are very clever and important , no doubt , but even your earnings will not keep the family .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 12]: There is a little work left for Mollie and myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 4]: cried Ruth hotly .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 23]: Whereupon Trix elevated the red marks which should have been her eyebrows , and exclaimed coolly -- `` Hallo , still snapping !
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 13]: I thought you would be quite good-tempered after such a holiday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 22]: It was indeed like being at home again to hear a squabble between Ruth and Trix within the first ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 71]: When the house was reached , there was the little mother standing in the doorway , smiling and waving her hands in welcome ; but at the first sight of her both girls felt a sudden choking sensation in the throat , so wan did she appear , so bleached in colour , such a tiny , frail little creature to be burdened with the care of an impecunious household !
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 45]: She clung to her girls , and her girls clung to her , and presently they were seated together round the dining-room table , on which , in spite of Trix 's dismal prophecy , appeared a tray of the ever-welcome afternoon - tea .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 8]: `` After their journey , Trix dear !
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 12]: I thought just this once , '' murmured Mrs Connor apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 9]: `` Dear Ruth , how sweet you look !
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 6]: Is that a new coat ?
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 20]: No , I see it is not ; but it looks new , with that charming collar and vest .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 12]: And your hair , dear ; and Mollie 's , too !
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 4]: So beautifully done !
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 7]: I suppose the maid taught you ?
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 21]: Oh , darlings , I 'm thankful to have you back , but I should never have sent for you !
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 14]: You were on the spot , and could judge best what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 14]: Did you -- did you let Uncle Bernard know of our trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 22]: The strained eagerness of the small face , the involuntary tremor in the voice , smote the girls to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 63]: Ruth turned her head aside , herself on the verge of tears , while Mollie said brokenly -- `` We sent him your letter to read , and when he said nothing I asked him point-blank if he would lend father enough money to put things right just now , and promised that we would all work to pay him back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 7]: `` Yes , dear -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 4]: And then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 5]: `` He would n't .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 20]: He jeered at me , and said he made it a rule never to throw good money after bad .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 26]: He would keep us for the remaining six weeks , if we agreed to stay , but more than that he must refuse to do .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 22]: So there seemed no alternative , mother dear , but to come straight away and try to help you ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 7]: `` Yes , dear -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 3]: Bless you !
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 6]: You were quite right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 37]: Mrs Connor tried to speak bravely ; but it was as if the last gleam of hope had died out of her tired eyes , and her hands trembled as she clasped them in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 27]: She herself had not realised until this moment how much she had counted upon Uncle Bernard 's intervention , and now the last hope seemed gone .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 26]: She shivered , and put her hand to her head ; then forced herself to smile , as she met the girls ' anxious gaze .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 12]: `` It 's always the darkest the hour before the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 16]: You must talk things over with pater , dears ; my head is so confused .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 29]: I shall be thankful for your help in the house , and no doubt something will turn up for you , as it has done for Trix . ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 28]: `` Mother , '' cried Ruth , with an outburst of irritation , which was the result of tired-out nerves and body , `` Trix is insupportable !
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 12]: She behaves as if she were the head of the house !
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 15]: How can you let her give herself such airs and domineer over you so ?
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 17]: I sha n't stand it for one , and the sooner she understands it the better .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 35]: I am not going to be ordered about by a bit of a chit of seventeen , and apologise to her if I dare to have as much as a cup of tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 6]: `` Hu-ush , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 26]: Mrs Connor cast an apprehensive glance towards the half-opened door , through which Trix 's voice could be heard superintending the carrying of the luggage .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 7]: `` She is such a child !
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 17]: Young things are always inclined to go to extremes ; and she has been so good !
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 12]: I do n't know what I should have done without her !
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 13]: We must not let her feel slighted because you have returned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 31]: That was true enough ; Trix had borne the heat and burden of the day , while her stepsisters were amusing themselves , in blissful ignorance of the gathering troubles .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 25]: Ruth 's irritation was silenced by the reminder , and she listened quietly while Mollie pressed her mother for details of the present situation .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 11]: Alas , it was even worse than had been expected !
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 39]: It was so bad that it could not well be worse , and it seemed ridiculous to talk of what they could afford , since , as a matter of fact , they could afford nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 16]: It was a matter of speculation whence the next twenty pounds was to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 10]: ` Man 's extremity is God 's opportunity ! '
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 13]: Some friend will be raised up to help us through this strait .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 20]: It is not often that we are brought to a point when we realise our own helplessness so plainly .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 18]: Let us look upon it as an opportunity , and watch to see what He will do .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 23]: ` Be not dismayed , neither be afraid , for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 50]: Mrs Connor 's voice sank to a rapt whisper , her face shone with that wonderful grace and exaltation which the Christian knows in the midst of his trial ; but her daughters looked at her pinched cheeks and haggard eyes , and felt their hearts sink within them .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 24]: It was a dreary evening -- how different from the triumphant home-coming which fancy had painted so often during the weeks of absence !
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 8]: The house felt unbearably cramped and airless .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 37]: It was dreadful to have no garden , after having practically lived out of doors ; and oh , what a contrast the evening meal presented from the repast served nightly in the old oak dining-hall !
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 59]: When people are in the extremity of anxiety and poverty , they have no heart to attend to the little superfluities which add so much to the beauty of daily life ; there was not a single flower on the table , nor in the half-lit drawing-room , where Trix sternly forbade the lighting of a second lamp .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 29]: Mr Connor sat silent and haggard , and his wife poured out tea and smiled a pathetic , patient little smile , as the children catechised the travellers .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 8]: Was the Court a jolly big house ?
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 7]: Were there strawberries in the garden ?
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 14]: Did the footmen wear white stockings , like the Lord Mayor 's Show ?
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 10]: What was the name of the horse that bolted ?
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 9]: What did they have for dinner every night ?
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 19]: On and on went the endless catechism , which the sisters tolerated only as an improvement on silence .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 25]: They had no wish to visit Attica , but retired upstairs to their bedroom at the earliest possible moment to mingle tears of misery .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 12]: `` I -- I feel as if I should burst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 4]: cried Ruth expressively .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 14]: `` My heart is so full that I ca n't bear another thing !
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 14]: Everything seems to have happened at once , and I feel crushed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 11]: `` It 's so bad that it must get better !
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 8]: it ca n't possibly get worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 12]: said Mollie , persistently hopeful in the midst of her misery .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 11]: But alas , her prophecy was not justified by events !
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 57]: Mrs Connor crawled about the house for another week , looking every day smaller and more fragile ; and then a morning came when she could not rise from bed , and all other anxieties seemed to dwindle in significance when the illness took a serious turn , and her precious life itself seemed in danger .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 4]: THE SILVER LINING .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 28]: Ruth and Mollie constituted themselves nurses , Mollie , as the more robust of the two , insisting upon taking as her share the arduous night duties .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 45]: Trix found time to attend to the housekeeping between school hours , the younger children were housed by sympathetic friends , and on the once noisy house settled down that painful silence which prevails when a fight is being waged between life and death .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 37]: At the beginning of the illness Ruth was dismayed to see a stranger in Dr Maclure 's place , but on the third day he appeared , bringing with him an atmosphere of comfort and security .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 47]: One felt now that all that was possible from human skill and care would be done for the dear invalid , and , busy man as he was , Dr Maclure found time for several visits a day , until the first acute anxiety was passed .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 51]: Until then his intercourse with Ruth had been solely that of physician and nurse , but one morning , when the invalid 's temperature and pulse both showed a satisfactory decline , he walked into the dining-room on the way to the door , and motioned Ruth to a seat .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 7]: `` Sit down for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 10]: I want to have a little talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 28]: It is a doctor 's duty to see that a nurse does not overtax her strength , and you are looking very ill these last few days .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 37]: I am going to prescribe a tonic which I want you to take regularly , and you must contrive to have a walk each day , and , if possible , a rest in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 14]: You might lie down on the sofa while your mother is dozing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 11]: Ruth flushed , and shook her head in pretty disclaimer .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 8]: `` Oh , I am all right !
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 6]: Do n't trouble about me .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 13]: I have not half such a hard time of it as Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 23]: The nursing does n't tire me a bit ; it is other things which make one feel rather ill at times . ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 13]: And it is about those other things that I want to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 19]: Eleanor and I have been abroad for a month , and have heard little or no home news .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 41]: I was ill -- that is to say , feeling rather worn out , '' corrected the doctor , with a sudden flush of colour to his thin cheeks , `` so we decided to treat ourselves to a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 28]: I found on my return that Mrs Connor was ill , and heard rumours which strengthened my own conviction that her trouble was more mental than physical .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 22]: It is not giving a doctor a fair chance to keep back anything from him in a case of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 27]: I want you to tell me honestly , as a friend and physician , if anything can be done to set her mind at rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 10]: `` We are ruined , that 's the trouble !
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 27]: The pater has lost every penny -- not by his own fault , but through some wretched man who has deliberately cheated him for months back .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 34]: He ca n't even go on with what business is left , for want of capital , so we have arrived at the point when we do n't know what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 31]: We look pretty much as usual , I suppose , but we are just as much paupers as if we lived in the big workhouse over in Smithdown Lane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 19]: Dr Maclure paced slowly up and down the room , stopping immediately in front of Ruth 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 9]: `` But , excuse me -- your uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 11]: Surely he will help at a crisis of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 27]: Before I went abroad I heard great stories of your life at the Court , and of the very marked preference which he showed to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 28]: It seemed a foregone conclusion that his choice had fallen upon you , and , if so -- '' `` Ah , that was a month ago !
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 7]: Many things have happened since then .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 12]: Uncle Bernard does n't like me as much as he did .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 13]: He discovered my weaknesses , and accused me of being a coward .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 30]: I am not a coward , as a rule , but I wanted so badly to please him that I was afraid to be natural , as Mollie was .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 25]: Before we came away someone went to his desk and read the draft of a will which he had mentioned a few days before .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 41]: It was not altered or tampered with in any way , but , of course , it was a mean thing to pry into his private papers , when he had put us on our honour by speaking of it .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 28]: We all denied it , but just because I had been afraid before , I know he suspects that I did it , and dare not confess .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 9]: -- Then we came away against his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 25]: Jack Melland left , too , so only one out of the four remains , and he is certain to be the heir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 8]: `` You mean Mr Victor Druce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 10]: Ruth started , raising a flushed , bewildered face .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 15]: `` Yes ; but how , -- what do you know about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 11]: `` Trix brought some of your letters to show us .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 9]: His name was mentioned very often , Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 13]: I had a presentiment that you two would be more than friends .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 18]: You must forgive me , but one 's perceptions grow keen when one 's interests are strong .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 23]: I thought that very probably Mr Farrell had some such hope in inviting you and Mollie to meet these two men . ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 5]: `` Perhaps he had .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 19]: I have thought so , too , but , in any case , it has come to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 39]: Jack Melland cares for nothing but his work , and Mr Druce -- '' Ruth hesitated , possessed by a sudden impulse to confide her own troubles to this man , who loved her , and would understand .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 20]: Her lids dropped till the dark lashes lay on her flushed cheek ; she clasped her hands nervously together .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 20]: `` He made love to me as long as I was in favour , but it was only pretence .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 24]: He really cares for another girl , but he thought I should be a better bargain if I were Uncle Bernard 's heiress .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 24]: He has taken no notice of me lately , but we found him out before that , -- I and the other girl .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 24]: She is good and charming , and in every way better than I am , and she had cared for him , too .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 23]: I expect he will try to marry her now that I am in disgrace , but she will never accept him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 6]: `` And you , Ruth ?
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 12]: Has it gone very hardly with you , poor child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 13]: There was silence for several moments before Ruth lifted a thoughtful face .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 9]: `` I -- do n't -- know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 4]: she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 56]: `` It was a shock to me at first , and I felt as if I could never believe in a man again , but since I came home I have hardly thought about him , and if I had cared as much as I imagined that would have been the worst trouble of all .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 10]: I think it was just part of the experience .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 4]: Can you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 25]: Summer-time , and the lovely country , and the holiday feeling , and nothing to do but laze about , and amuse ourselves together .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 7]: It seemed -- do n't laugh !
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 9]: -- so natural to fall in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 21]: Dr Maclure did not laugh , but a smile flashed over his face , full of immeasurable relief and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 10]: `` I do understand , '' he said heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 18]: `` You have had so few chances of enjoying yourself with young people of your own age .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 24]: It was , as you say , quite natural , but I hope you will have no more to do with the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 12]: He is a pretty contemptible specimen , by all accounts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 10]: Ruth reared her little head with a haughty gesture .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 65]: `` I could forgive a great deal to a man who really loved me , but nothing to an adventurer who cares only for his own gains ; I am sorry the dear old Court will fall into such hands , for he can not make a good master , and , as far as we are concerned , it will cease to exist .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: That dream has come to an end , Dr Maclure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 15]: `` Well , one must hope it will be replaced by something more lasting .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 11]: Do n't trouble too much about Mr Connor 's difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 18]: I feel quite convinced that some arrangement can be made to tide him over the present crisis .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 23]: You may not live at the Court , but it is equally certain that you are not going to the workhouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 22]: He held out his hand , and Ruth said good-bye with a little tremor of relief and thankfulness in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 37]: Dr Maclure was a man of few words , but what he said he meant , and his quiet , assured manner made him seem a veritable rock of refuge in the midst of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 26]: Ruth felt happier and more hopeful than she had done for many a long day , despite the uneasiness caused by the doctor 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 28]: His skin was bronzed by his tour abroad , otherwise he must have looked shockingly ill , for he was thin and worn to a marked extent .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 28]: Remembering the date of his illness , it was impossible not to connect it with her own refusal , and Ruth 's heart softened at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 14]: `` He has suffered for me , as I have suffered for Victor !
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 12]: He is a real man ; true and strong and honest .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 16]: Everywhere people run after him and admire him , but he cares only for me .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 5]: How much he cares !
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 6]: His poor , thin face !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 22]: All this time while I have been forgetting , he has been thinking of me , and grieving himself ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 14]: Sad though the reflection might be , there was comfort mingled with it .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 27]: The sore , slighted feeling of the last few weeks could not survive while a man of Donald Maclure 's calibre placed her first among women .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 68]: That very evening , after his second visit to the invalid , the doctor was closeted with Mr Connor for an hour , and after his departure the latter joined his step-daughters in the dining-room , where Mollie was eating her deferred dinner in preparation for the night 's watch , and the first glance at his face proved that a light had arisen in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 7]: `` The worst is over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 4]: he said tremblingly .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 8]: `` Maclure has come to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 10]: He is a good fellow -- a noble fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 48]: God will reward him ; I am to draw upon him for necessary expenses for the next few months ; and I have no doubt the business will go well -- so many men have come forward and offered to support me if I could keep going .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 16]: This will be the best possible medicine for your mother , and for us all .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 22]: It will give us heart to work , and we shall have to work hard to pay off the loan . ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 18]: Ruth set her lips in a determined fashion , which gave a new expression to her face .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 35]: She was thankful beyond words for help in this time of need , but the fact that it had come from Donald Maclure , of all people , made the debt difficult to bear .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: He had already offered much , and had been rejected .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 8]: She felt oppressed by his very generosity .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 34]: That night when she went to bed , Ruth unfolded the little bundle of letters which she had received from Raby since her return home , and read them over with lingering attention .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 29]: No word from Uncle Bernard , though both girls had written to him more than once , telling him of their mother 's illness and progress towards recovery .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 16]: Not a line from Victor , though he must have known of the added trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 65]: A short , manly letter of sympathy from Jack Melland , who had heard of the bad news through Mrs Thornton -- a letter addressed to Ruth , with `` kindest regards to her sister '' ; three long , underlined epistles from that lady herself , and one sheet covered with a beautiful , distinctive handwriting , and signed `` Margot Blount . ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 25]: Ruth opened this last letter first of all , and passed hurriedly over expressions of condolence to the more practical part of the message .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 28]: `` And now , Ruth , you must not think because Fate has separated us in this hurried manner that you have seen the last of me .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 23]: I want to be your friend now and always , and hope to see a great deal of you in the future .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 11]: Mrs Thornton says that you wish to find some work .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 30]: I am neither rich nor clever , but I know a great many people , and I have some little influence , so I can certainly help you there .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 29]: Write , dear , and tell me if you have any special vocation in view , or if you are willing to take the best chance that offers .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 15]: I have a rich and gouty relation whose companion is shortly to be married .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 37]: I could recommend you for the post , when you would be well paid , and live in luxury ; but I know you would feel prisoned , and long to throw cushions at her occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 3]: I should !
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 26]: There are numerous societies and guilds also to which I belong , and to one of which you might be appointed as secretary or treasurer .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 20]: Then you would be your own mistress , and free ; but is freedom worth much in London lodgings ?
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 30]: I ca n't fancy you roughing it by yourself , and I keep hoping against hope for some sudden turn of the tide which may still make it unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 10]: Do n't settle to anything before telling me first .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 14]: I know I can find something really good if you give me time .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 21]: `` Mr Druce is very much in evidence , acting host at the Court , and visiting far and near .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 35]: He tells me that Mr Farrell consults him on every point , and gives him carte blanche to do as he likes ; and I hear as much from other sources , more reliable .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 34]: As his position becomes more assured , his attentions increase ; but he will not make the fatal mistake of burdening himself with a poor wife until there is no possibility of mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 27]: Therefore , it may some day be my painful duty to refuse to become mistress of the Court ; but the refusing itself I shall enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 28]: You would not , for you have a gentle nature ; but Mr Druce shall find that he can not play with Margot Blount for naught ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 37]: Ruth could see in imagination the haughty tilt of Margot 's graceful head , and the flash in her eyes , as she wrote those words , and did not envy Victor his hour of awakening .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 25]: Evidently the whole countryside now looked upon him as the accepted heir , and even hopeful Mrs Thornton ceased to prophesy for the future .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 30]: `` I have seen Mr Farrell twice this last week , but have not succeeded in making him mention your names , '' she wrote in her last letter .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 14]: `` I talk continuously of you -- in what vein you can imagine !
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 18]: -- and read extracts from your letters ; and he listens intently , but makes no remarks .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 45]: I can see him mentally pounce on anything which gives him fresh insight into your life here , as if he were still interested in the study of your characters ; but the moment I stop speaking he turns the conversation to impersonal topics .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 12]: Only one thing he has done which I thought really thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 46]: Ruth 's camera was found lying about , and he gave instructions that it was to be taken down to the photographers the same day , and copies printed from all the films , so that your mother might receive them as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 25]: I believe they were sent up yesterday , so that you may expect them soon , and perhaps a letter at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 15]: Mr Druce is kind and amiable , and very much the man in possession .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 19]: I do n't take to him , but my husband believes he will make a good squire . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 9]: `` Will , '' not `` would '' !
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 8]: This from Mrs Thornton was conclusive indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 17]: Ruth dropped a salt tear on the back of the sheet as she folded it up .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 17]: It was good news to hear of the trouble Uncle Bernard had taken on her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 21]: Surely , surely he would not forward the photographs without enclosing some sort of an answer to her many notes !
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 48]: For the next few days Ruth 's heart leapt every time the postman 's knock sounded at the door ; but , when the longed-for packet arrived , the words , `` Photographs only , '' written on the back , killed her hopes at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 26]: The pictures themselves were fairly successful , and gave a happy half - hour to the invalid , who bent lovingly over each familiar scene .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 16]: `` It takes me back to my youth to see the dear old rooms again !
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 24]: How successful you are with interiors , Ruth ; but you have no photograph of the library , one of my favourite haunts .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 10]: How did you come to leave that out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 5]: `` I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 6]: I took it twice over .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 18]: I 'm sorry , dear , but I expect they were failures , '' said Ruth wearily .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 16]: She could not guess that on these missing pictures hung the fate of many lives .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 4]: LOVE 'S CONQUEST .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 31]: Six months had passed by , taking with them the keen edge of anxiety , but leaving behind the dull , monotonous routine which is almost as hard to bear .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 72]: It is not enlivening , to be obliged to work instead of play , to look ten times at a sixpence before you dare spend it , to consider what you can do without , rather than what you can have , and to see no prospect ahead but continual cheese-paring and self-denial ; and when you happen to be young and full of life , it is harder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 69]: With Dr Maclure 's help , Mr Connor was able to continue his business , and his City friends rallied round him , doing their best to put work in his way ; but , even so , there were pressing debts to be settled besides the loan which one and all were anxious to repay , so that housekeeping expenses had to be reduced to a minimum .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 43]: It was decided that one of the elder girls must stay at home , while the other tried for work abroad , and it was at once a relief and a blow for Ruth when Mollie was chosen as mother 's help .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 39]: She had dreaded the irksome duties of mending , cooking , dusting , and everlasting putting to rights , which would have fallen to her share , but it would have been a comfort to have been chosen !
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 23]: `` Do n't feel hurt , darling ; it 's a pure question of suitability , '' Mrs Connor had explained anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 15]: `` Mollie is stronger than you are , and has a more adaptable temperament .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 20]: She wo n't feel the little jars as you would , and will get on better with the maid .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 18]: It is the art of a good general to place his forces in the best position . ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 8]: `` Yes , of course , dear .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 7]: It 's quite -- quite right !
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 44]: Arrange everything as you think best , '' replied Ruth sweetly , kissing the little , wistful face as she spoke ; for Mrs Connor was still very fragile , and by Dr Maclure 's orders had to be spared all possible worry .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 23]: The same orders were extended to forbid Ruth from taking advantage of Lady Margot 's offer to procure work at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 30]: `` Unless it proves absolutely impossible to find a suitable post here , I do n't think it would be wise to subject your mother to any further anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 20]: She would be constantly worrying about your welfare , and that is the very thing we wish to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 16]: Would it be a great disappointment to you to give up going to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 14]: he inquired , with a quick , grave look at Ruth 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 8]: `` It would be a blessed relief .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 18]: I 'd a million times rather be at home ; but what can I find to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 10]: I am ashamed to think how incompetent I am !
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 26]: Here we are back again where we were three months ago , Dr Maclure , when I worried you and Eleanor about a vocation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 17]: Ruth smiled , then flushed crimson at a sudden remembrance of how that conversation had ended .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 23]: She was immeasurably thankful to the doctor for looking in an opposite direction and continuing to talk in the most matter-of-fact manner .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 23]: `` It occurred to me last night that I knew of a post which might suit you for the next few months .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 21]: The secretary of our Home for Nurses is on the point of breaking down , and needs a good rest .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 25]: The work needs no special knowledge ; it consists mainly in answering endless notes of inquiries , and in keeping some very simple accounts .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 11]: I could soon coach you up in what is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 19]: You would have to be there from ten to six -- not heavy hours , as things go .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 26]: I think I could secure the post for you for , say , the next three months , if you cared to accept it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 9]: `` And how much should I get ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 23]: `` Miss Edgar 's salary is forty pounds ; you would get a fourth of that -- '' `` Ten pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 8]: Ruth stared at him with dilated eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 4]: `` Ten pounds !
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 16]: Every day from ten to six for three whole months , and only ten pounds !
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 29]: Dr Maclure , do you know it is a real , true , honest fact that I paid twenty pounds for a ball-dress only a few weeks ago ?
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 11]: I 've got it now in a box upstairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 4]: The doctor smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 10]: `` I should like to see you in it !
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 7]: I hope I may some day .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 25]: It certainly seems a good deal of money , but I suppose it is very fine , and will last a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 6]: `` But it wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 23]: It 's a mere wisp of gauze , that will only be fit to burn after being worn two or three times .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 17]: And I should have to work for six months to earn enough to pay for it !
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 3]: How shocking !
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 17]: What a terrible difference there is between the lives of the rich and the poor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 12]: `` Ah , there you have touched on a great problem !
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 29]: After you have had some experience of being a working woman , you may not care to buy any more twenty-pound dresses , even if the opportunity offers .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 27]: I know that the payment is small , but I am afraid you would find it difficult to get more without any special knowledge or training .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 30]: It is hard for you , especially coming so soon after your taste of luxury ; but if you can face it -- '' `` Oh yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 33]: I 'll take it , and be thankful ; and perhaps , if I do very well and keep the books nicely , I may be worth fifty pounds next time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 18]: said Ruth , with a charming courage , which might well have aroused any man 's admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 12]: Dr Maclure made no remark , and turned his head aside .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 17]: He had a habit nowadays of looking at other things when he was speaking to Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 66]: So it happened that while Mollie worked at home , Ruth went forth every day to her monotonous task , trudging along the same well-known path , in sun and rain , heat and cold -- for the secretary 's leave of absence had to be prolonged -- until Christmas was close at hand , and the ten pounds ' salary had doubled in value .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 48]: `` I shall be able to buy myself a new mackintosh and a pair of good stout boots , '' Ruth said to herself , as she trudged home one dismal December evening , and felt a suspicious dampness in the soles of her tired little feet .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 61]: She had no idea what a charming figure she made in her long , dark coat , with her hair curling in wet rings about her face ; for she carried no umbrella , as her cloth toque defied the weather , and she preferred to keep her hands free to hold her skirts from contact with the muddy roads .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 47]: The pink-and-white face , with its delicately cut features , and straight black brows , shone out like a flower among the tired , colourless-looking throng of workers who wended their way homeward ; and her expression was bright and alert , despite the dismal surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 10]: Ruth was surprised at her own happiness of late .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 48]: Her work was dull and monotonous , and she had few pleasures to relieve it ; yet , for some mysterious reason , she was more truly content at heart than in those days of ease and luxury , which seemed like a dream of the past .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 33]: Six months had passed since that memorable day when she and Mollie had bidden adieu to the Court ; and Uncle Bernard still lived , and was apparently in the same condition .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 65]: Mrs Thornton kept her friends well informed of the news of the neighbourhood , so that they knew that , though Victor Druce had ostensibly returned to town at the expiration of his three months ' visit , he was constantly running down and bringing friends with him for a few days ' shooting , with the privilege of a son of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 30]: For the rest , Margot Blount had returned to town , and Jack Melland 's communications were limited to an occasional picture-postcard bearing half a dozen words of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 58]: Mollie made no comment on the briefness of these missives , and was always cheery and busy , but sometimes on her return from her day 's work Ruth would look at her anxiously , and wonder if it were only imagination that Mollie looked different , thinner and older -- a woman rather than a girl .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 27]: Perhaps after all she had the harder path -- shut up in the house , without the daily variety of seeing fresh rooms and fresh faces .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 43]: The regular constitutional , too , was in itself health-giving , and though Ruth received much pity at home on the score of her long , wet walks , it was astonishing what pleasant surprises loomed out of the fog at times .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 13]: She smiled to herself , and a dimple dipped in her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 43]: The good old fairy days were not yet over , when a tired Cinderella , trudging through the mire , was suddenly provided with a comfortable carriage , springing as it were out of the earth to carry her to her destination .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 64]: It was extraordinary how often Dr Maclure 's brougham `` happened '' to be travelling in the same direction as herself on wet evenings ; and although the doctor himself was conspicuous by his absence , the coachman was wonderfully quick to recognise one figure out of many , and to draw up with a `` Just driving past your house , miss .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 8]: Can I give you a lift ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 43]: Ruth had no doubt that it was the master , not the man , who was responsible for these meetings , and the conviction brought with it a glow of content , of which as yet she failed to realise the meaning .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 44]: Nevertheless , her heart beat with a pleasurable excitement as she threaded her way through the crowded streets , wondering if once again the fairy equipage would be sent to the rescue , if it would appear at this corner or the next .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 42]: At last , through the driving sleet , she recognised the familiar outline of the brougham drawn up beside the pavement , but for once the coachman sat stiffly on his box , while the master stepped forward to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 10]: `` Miss Ruth , it is a shocking evening !
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 10]: I have a call to pay in this neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 13]: Do let George drive you home before you are wet through . ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 8]: Ruth stood still and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 43]: The drops of moisture were thick upon hat and coat , her soft cheeks were damp with rain , but her eyes danced with a spice of mischief which was more like Mollie than the grave , elder sister of the family .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 63]: `` I 'll drive with pleasure on one condition -- that you will first allow yourself to be taken to your patient 's house , '' she replied demurely , adding when the doctor hesitated in embarrassment : `` It is such a very odd neighbourhood for a patient to live in , in the midst of these great blocks of offices !
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 16]: I think we may perhaps have to drive you a long , long way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 47]: For a moment Dr Maclure did not reply ; he merely held open the door of the carriage , waiting until Ruth should have taken her seat ; then he leant towards her , the light from the lamps showing the nervous tremor of his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 26]: `` I will come in too , on one condition -- that you are willing to drive beside me all the way , Ruth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 5]: What did he mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 19]: Ruth started and flushed , for the tone of voice was even more eloquent than the words themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 27]: The moment which she had vaguely expected , dreaded , and hoped for , had come suddenly upon her , provoked by her own jesting words .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 42]: She did not know what to say , or how to say it , only one definite thought stood out distinctly in the confusion of her mind , namely , that Dr Maclure was standing unprotected in the damp and cold .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 21]: She held out her hand towards him , and cried tremulously -- `` Do n't stand out in the rain !
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 6]: Oh , please come in !
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 8]: We will go where you like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 20]: Dr Maclure leapt lightly to his seat , and the coachman whipped up his horses without waiting for instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 24]: A coachman is only an ordinary man after all , and George had seen how the wind blew for many a long day .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 28]: He took care not to drive too quickly , nor to choose the shortest routes , satisfied that for once his master was not in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 32]: Inside the brougham Dr Maclure held Ruth 's shabbily gloved little hand in his , and asked earnestly -- `` Can you give me a different answer this time , Ruth ?
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 18]: It has been a weary waiting , and I seem to have grown worse instead of better .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 8]: I fear it is an incurable complaint !
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 19]: Can you give me a glimmer of hope , dear , or is it still quite impossible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 26]: Ruth shook her head and nodded and smiled , and sighed , and shed a few bright tears , in a whirl of delightful confusion .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 11]: `` It 's -- it 's not impossible at all !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 7]: I think I am quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 11]: I have been growing surer and surer all this time .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 6]: But am I good enough ?
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 16]: You remember that six months ago I fancied myself in love with someone else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 36]: `` I can afford to forget that episode , and even to be thankful for it , if it has shown you your own mind , so that now you are ` quite sure ' !
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 12]: Oh , Ruth , it is too good to be true !
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 14]: Can you really be happy with a dull , old fellow like me ?
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 35]: No country seat , you know ; no life of ease and luxury , just a comfortable , commonplace house , with a husband who is too hard-worked to have much time for play .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 22]: I have no fortune to offer you , dear , except love -- there 's no end to that wealth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 14]: Ruth turned her beautiful eyes upon him with a smile of perfect content .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 7]: `` But that 's everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 12]: `` I shall be the richest woman in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 4]: MARGOT 'S ANSWER .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 32]: A week later Victor Druce was sitting _ tete-a-tete _ with Margot Blount in the drawing-room of her aunt 's London house , a cramped little house in a fashionable neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 44]: The house was generally let furnished during the season , and inhabited by the impecunious owner at those odd seasons of the year when she had no invitations which made it possible to saddle other people with the cost of food and maintenance .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 67]: Just now there was a gap of a few weeks between the last shooting-party and a Christmas gathering in the country , so the house had been reopened , and friends flocked to call and leave cards , foremost among them Mr Victor Druce , a young man of importance , nowadays , as the accredited heir to one of the finest properties in the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 27]: `` I am not at home to anyone else this afternoon , '' Margot announced to the servant , as Victor took his seat beside her .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 22]: She smiled to herself as she spoke , an odd little smile , whose meaning her visitor was puzzled to decipher .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 28]: It was a great compliment to be allowed a private interview , but there was a mysterious something in Margot 's manner which detracted from his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 25]: He watched her as she poured out tea at the inlaid Turkish table , with eyes in which admiration and anxiety were equally mingled .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 47]: He had known many women more beautiful , but never one with such an air of grace and distinction ; every movement of the slim body and white tapering fingers was a poem in itself , and the coils of chestnut hair shone like burnished gold .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 22]: Even in the poorest of surroundings Margot would look an aristocrat , and reflect credit on her husband 's good taste .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 66]: While he was drinking his tea and listening to the pretty flow of conversation about everything in general and nothing in particular , which seems to come so naturally to women of the world , Victor was busy painting a mental picture of a wonderful , rose-coloured future where he would reign as master of Raby Court , with Margot acting chatelaine by his side .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 39]: The exclusive county families might have hesitated to welcome a stranger , who was moreover a `` City man , '' but , with Margot Blount as his wife , he would have the entree into any society .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 30]: Victor congratulated himself on his usual good luck , inasmuch as this desirable partner was the girl of all others whom he would have selected for her own sake .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 69]: A year ago he had looked upon her as a star entirely out of his own sphere , for he had the poorest of prospects for the future , but now , as by the stroke of a magician 's wand , a fine position was almost assured , and he could approach Margot if not as an equal , still as a match whom nobody need disdain .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 6]: Almost , but not quite !
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 5]: There lay the rub .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 24]: The old squire still lingered on , dying by inches as it were , and preserving to the last his grim enigmatical silence .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 38]: Victor had not heard one word from his lips to substantiate his hopes ; but actions -- which , as the proverb says , speak louder than words -- all seemed to range themselves in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 58]: His three rivals had retired in disfavour , and , receiving no replies to their first letters , had gradually ceased writing , so that there was at present no correspondence between them and the squire , while he himself was a constant visitor , and was even allowed carte blanche in inviting and entertaining his friends .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 31]: The very servants about the place spoke of him as `` the young master , '' and the local tradesfolk lost no opportunity of begging his patronage in the future .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 25]: Surely , surely he might be done with doubts , and allow himself the joy of speaking out all that was in his heart !
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 15]: `` A penny for your thoughts , Mr Druce , '' cried Margot gaily .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 14]: `` You have not been listening to me for the last ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 15]: It must have been a very pleasant day-dream to engross you so completely . ''
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 9]: `` It was , '' said Victor simply .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 17]: For once he was thoroughly sincere , and voice and manner both testified to the change .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 26]: `` I was thinking of you , '' he added , looking at her with the dark eyes which could be so eloquent upon occasions .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 14]: `` My daydreams have always been of you for the last year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 4]: `` Always ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 4]: echoed Margot sceptically .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 22]: She selected a little cake from the basket by her side , and nibbled it daintily with her small white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 7]: I am surprised to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 11]: I fancied that you were more catholic in your tastes .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 28]: It is very flattering of you to include me in your dreams , but I am not presumptuous enough to expect to occupy the entire stage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 4]: `` Presumptuous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 4]: echoed Victor reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 45]: The vague uneasiness which had possessed him since the beginning of the interview was deepened by the unconcealed irony of her tone ; and he realised suddenly that he must speak plainly , since it was dangerous to play fast and loose any longer .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 11]: `` What a word for you to use of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 25]: It is I who am presumptuous to dream of you as I do ; but a man is not always master of his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 15]: I think you must know what my feelings have been ever since we met .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 43]: I fell hopelessly in love with you at first sight -- hopelessly in every way , as it seemed at that time ; but , all the same , my fate was sealed , and the world held no other woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 4]: `` Really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 11]: queried Margot again , in the same voice of scepticism .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 13]: `` But , then , how wonderfully you act , Mr Druce !
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 31]: I have seen you only occasionally during the year , but I can not say that you impressed me as a man who had lost his interest in my sex !
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 22]: At one time I made sure -- a good many people made sure -- that you had a very definite preference .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 23]: That was at the beginning of your stay at the Court , when Mr Farrell seemed so devoted to his charming grand-niece .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 21]: Do you remember the afternoon when I came to call , and found you two sitting together upon the terrace ?
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 7]: What a charming picture you made !
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 14]: The old house makes an ideal background for a _ tete-a-tete _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 13]: Victor 's eyes lit up with a flash of relief and triumph .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 21]: Margot was jealous -- that was the reason of the change of manner which had puzzled him all the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 20]: She was jealous of his attention to Ruth Farrell , which she evidently looked upon as disloyal to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 25]: As he could not deny the evidence of her own eyesight , the wisest plan was to throw himself upon her generosity and forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 11]: `` Ah , you must not be hard on me !
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 15]: You were out of reach , and the time and the opportunity were there .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 14]: She was a pretty girl , and not disinclined for an innocent flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 14]: You would not confound so trivial an incident with my feeling for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 23]: Ruth Farrell is a charming girl in her own way ; but -- '' `` But not so charming as she was !
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 22]: She has fallen from favour all round , poor little Ruth , since Mr Farrell transferred his favour to another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 15]: Victor leapt from his seat , and strode across the room to her side .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 8]: `` Margot , what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 10]: Why do you speak to me in that voice ?
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 14]: Leave Ruth Farrell alone -- she is nothing to you or to me .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 17]: I have been waiting to ask you a question , but I can wait no longer .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 26]: If the Court is mine , if Mr Farrell makes me his heir , as we all expect , will you share my good fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 15]: Will you be my wife , and make me the happiest man on earth ?
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 15]: I could give you a home which would be worthy even of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 31]: He bent over her as he spoke ; but Margot pushed back her chair , and rose to confront him , her head almost on a level with his own .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 14]: `` Really , Mr Druce , you are too original in your methods !
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 11]: A conditional proposal is quite a novelty in my experience .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 6]: _ If _ you inherit ?
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 9]: And what if by chance you are disappointed ?
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 8]: It is still possible , you know !
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 29]: There are some people who believe that the squire is deliberately misleading us all , and that the property will go to Ruth Farrell , despite all appearances .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 17]: I should like to know exactly how I stand before I commit myself to a reply .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 14]: Does your offer still hold good if Ruth inherits in your place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 15]: Victor 's eyelids sank , and a dull red flush showed on his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 6]: `` It is impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 3]: he protested .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 10]: `` Why will you conjure up such a position ?
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 15]: Mr Farrell has never mentioned his niece 's name since she left the Court .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 15]: He treats me like a son ; I come and go as I choose .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 15]: It is preposterous to believe there can be any doubt on the subject ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 6]: `` But suppose there were ?
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 16]: Suppose the impossible happened , if you like to put it in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 39]: `` If I were back in my old position -- worse than my old position , for these months of idleness have not helped me on -- I -- I should be no match for you , Margot .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 10]: You would not care to marry a pauper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 8]: `` Nor you an equally impecunious bride !
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 34]: My title would be of service to you as master of the Court , but a commoner with a substantial fortune to her back would be a better bargain for a budding barrister .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 14]: Such a commoner as -- shall we say Ruth Farrell , for example ?
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 25]: Mr Druce , you ought to succeed in your profession , for you have shown wonderful forethought in the management of your own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 16]: It was an admirable idea to provide for both emergencies , while leaving yourself free .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 27]: The only drawback to success is that Ruth and myself happened to be friends , and were mutually anxious that the other should not be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 25]: Under the circumstances , you will not be surprised that I must decline to consider the problematical offer of the Court and its master .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 20]: I will live unmarried all my days , or I will marry an honest man and a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 12]: Victor stood gazing at her , a figure cut in stone .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 20]: For a few moments stupefaction held him dumb ; then his face worked convulsively in the effort of speech .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 20]: `` You have known all along -- you have deliberately waited , intending to deal me this blow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 6]: Margot bent her head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 7]: `` Yes , I have waited !
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 21]: I am able to take care of myself , but I wished to make quite sure that Ruth was safe .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 15]: To-day I was glad to feel that it was unnecessary to wait any longer .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 20]: You will be interested to hear that Miss Farrell is happily engaged to an old friend of the family .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 13]: It sometimes happens that the cleverest of schemers falls between two stools .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 13]: The position is undignified , but you have only yourself to thank .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 15]: I think we have nothing more to say to each other , Mr Druce .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 11]: I have the pleasure to wish you -- Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 23]: She had touched the electric bell a moment before , and now the door opened and a servant stood awaiting her bidding .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 11]: In his presence it was impossible for Victor to reply .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 23]: For one moment he stood glaring at her , a picture of impotent fury , then slowly turned and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 24]: As the house door closed behind him , the electric bell pealed once more , and the servant turned back to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 12]: `` I am not at home in future to Mr Druce !
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 4]: Please remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 4]: said Lady Margot .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 18]: Then her eye fell on the envelope of a telegram which the man was carrying towards her .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 32]: She tore it open , saw at a glance that it came from Mrs Thornton at Raby , and read the following message : -- `` Squire died suddenly last night .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 12]: Husband , Druce , Melland , summoned to funeral on Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 5]: Will write details . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 22]: It was a duplicate of a message which was even then speeding on its way to the two grand-nieces in Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 5]: BERNARD FARRELL 'S HEIR .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 13]: `` I 'm not sorry ; I 'm _ glad _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 13]: cried Mollie , while a rain of tears rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 17]: `` He was old and was tired , and everyone he loved had gone before him .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 11]: It will be like going home to meet them again .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 30]: He was grim and cross and suspicious , but I loved him all the same , and in his queer way I am sure that he liked me too .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 8]: I 'm thankful he is at rest !
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 7]: ... ` Will write details . '
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 2]: Thursday !
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 11]: -- that means that she will write on Thursday evening .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 8]: Mrs Thornton is nothing if not businesslike .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 12]: We shall hear from her by the second post on Friday .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 11]: By Friday at ten o'clock we shall know our fate .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 13]: To be , or not to be -- that is the question .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 14]: Oh , I hope -- I hope he has remembered us a little !
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 36]: There is no chance of inheriting the Court , as we once dreamt of doing ; but still , there is a hope , and it will be a shock to bury it for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 56]: I used to feel comparatively indifferent ; but the strain of these last six months has made me greedy ; while you , you dear goose , who used to be all ambition , are in such a ludicrous condition of bliss that you can hardly rouse yourself to take any interest in the question !
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 8]: What it is to be engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 13]: Ruth tried to look contrite , but succeeded only in smiling seraphically .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 22]: `` When you are perfectly happy it is impossible to be happier , and I honestly do n't care very much .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 42]: I should like Uncle Bernard to leave me a nice message , and I should n't at all object to a legacy , which would provide my trousseau ; but the Court itself would be a white elephant to me now .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 24]: Donald adores his work , and would not give it up for any consideration , so we could never live there ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 12]: `` You might lend it to a poor but deserving family !
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 36]: Astonishing as it may appear , there are a few other people in the world beside yourself and Donald , and they are not all going to be married and live happily ever after ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 16]: This time Ruth did , indeed , look contrite , and that without an effort .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 10]: `` Oh , Mollie , I am horribly selfish !
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 5]: Forgive me , darling !
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 33]: I honestly do forget everybody but ourselves sometimes ; and it is hateful of me , for when I am so happy I ought to be more sympathetic , instead of less .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 7]: I am , when I remember !
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 19]: I am so bubbling over with happiness and good-will that I feel inclined to kiss everyone I meet .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 29]: But there is so much to be thought about , and every time we meet there seems to be more , and I get lost in dreams . ''
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 11]: `` Bless your heart , do n't apologise to me .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 5]: I like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 4]: cried Mollie heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 33]: `` I know your heart is right ; and it 's a poor thing if lovers ca n't live in a world of their own for a few weeks of their life .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 11]: I 'm thankful beyond words that your future is settled .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 19]: But oh , what a help a few hundreds would be to the rest of us just now !
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 21]: I feel as if I could hardly live until Friday morning , I am so anxious to hear the news !
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 7]: And the mysterious condition , Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 16]: Do you realise that we shall know all about it in three more days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 5]: `` I wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 4]: sighed Ruth dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 30]: Then , with sudden animation , `` If it is good news , -- if either of us came in for something really big , Mrs Thornton would wire !
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 6]: She simply could not wait .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 7]: She is far too impulsive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 16]: It was an unfortunate suggestion , as it added tenfold to the strain of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 23]: The minutes seemed to drag on Thursday afternoon and evening ; but no telegram appeared , and Mollie 's heart sank heavily .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 71]: She knew better than her sister how difficult it was to make both ends meet , and what a long and arduous task it would be to pay off the loans which had tided the family through their time of need , and she was tired -- as any natural , high-spirited young thing would be -- of all work and no play , and eagerly longing for a respite .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 64]: Mr Farrell had expressly stated that he would not divide his property ; but that did not prohibit small legacies , and when he knew that his nearest relations were in straits , surely -- surely ... Mollie was up and dressed even before her usual early hour the next morning , for sleep was impossible in such a whirl of nervous anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 28]: Ruth kissed her before departing to her work , and said -- `` Rush down to me , dear , if there is anything good to tell .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 10]: I shall look out for you about eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 22]: Mollie set about her household duties with great fervour , so as to make the long hour pass by more quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 21]: At last ten o'clock struck , and almost at the same time came the sound of the postman 's rat-tat .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 19]: She flew to the door , arriving at the very moment that three letters fell into the box .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 52]: One was of that long , narrow shape , which inevitably foretells a bill ; a second was unmistakably a circular ; the third -- Mollie stared at it , turned it over , looked at the postmark , stared at the writing again , in a whirl of bewildered dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 17]: It could not be an ordinary , unimportant letter from the children 's aunt at Brighton !
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 4]: It could not !
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 5]: The thing was impossible !
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 22]: Yet why , then , the address to Trix , the well-known writing -- most of all , the horrible postmark ?
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 29]: She put her hand to her head , wondering if it were true , or only a horrible nightmare that Mrs Thornton had not written , after all !
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 23]: The little mother came creeping out of the dining-room , and , seeing her child 's blanched face , was persistently optimistic .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 17]: Absurd to give up hope because a letter did not come by the first possible post !
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 29]: A hundred things might have happened to cause a delay ; and , even if it had been posted in time , the post-office was not always infallible .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 26]: Mrs Farrell recalled stories of belated letters from her own experience , and related them at length , while Mollie went numbly about her work .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 15]: The disappointment was severe , and seemed like a foretaste of worse to come .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 27]: Nevertheless , as time went on , her naturally buoyant nature asserted itself , and , as each delivery drew near , excitement grew to fever-pitch .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 21]: One o'clock , and a letter for the maid ; three o'clock , and the postman walked past the door .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 3]: Poor Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 24]: The sound of his departing footsteps rang like a knell in her ears , and two hot rebellious tears rose to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 52]: It did not seem possible that anything would have prevented the kindly Mrs Thornton from keeping her promise except sheer inability to communicate bad news ; and bad news meant that her own name and Ruth 's were not mentioned in the will , and that everything went to Victor Druce .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 16]: Oh , it was hard to give up so much to so unworthy a supplanter !
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 15]: The children came home from school and settled down to their `` prep . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 46]: Mrs Connor retired to her room for a rest , and Mollie took her way to her stepfather 's little den to set a match to the fire , and hold a newspaper before it to make it blaze cheerily in preparation for his return .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 41]: It was one of the pleasures of the day to make the sanctum look cheery and home-like for the tired man , and to-day there was an additional impetus in the knowledge that he would share in her own disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 37]: Mollie knelt by the grate , holding the newspaper in place -- a tired , disheartened little Cinderella , who would have liked to lay her head on the table and indulge in a good cry .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 35]: But such luxuries are not for the brave-hearted ; so she resolutely blinked away the rising tears , and , rising to her feet , lighted the crimson-shaded lamp on the writing - table .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 55]: Its rosy light had a wonderfully beautifying effect on the little room , giving an air of luxury to the commonplace furnishings ; and when the curtains were drawn , and the easy-chair drawn up to the fire , it was as bright and cheerful a little interior as one need wish to see .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 26]: Mollie looked round with a glance of satisfaction , then suddenly rushed into the hall at the sound of a loud knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 3]: So soon !
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 13]: She had not expected the next delivery for another half-hour at least .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 34]: No letter appeared in the box ; so , with wild visions of a legal missive , registered for greater safety , she threw open the door and peered out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 20]: A man 's tall figure stood on the step ; but it was not the figure of a postman .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 35]: Mollie leant forward -- the light from above shining on cheeks flushed from contact with the fire , and ruffled golden head -- leant forward , and stared into his face with incredulous eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 4]: `` Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 15]: cried a well-remembered voice , which broke into an eloquent tremor over the name .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 3]: cried Mollie !
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 4]: `` Mr Melland !
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 5]: It ca n't be !
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 5]: What does it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 8]: You ca n't really be here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 18]: He laughed at that , and took a step forward , like the masterful Jack of old .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 13]: `` I am here ; it is myself , and nobody else !
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 14]: I 'll tell you all about it if you will let me in .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 10]: It 's rather cold to-night , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 32]: She held the door wide open at that , and hurried him across the hall into the little , pink-lighted room , which she had just prepared for another 's reception .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 16]: There they stood face to face , staring at each other for a breathless moment .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 15]: `` I thought you were in Raby -- '' `` So I was yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 14]: I left this morning , and came down by the first train . ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 7]: `` Mrs Thornton promised to write .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 21]: I thought you were the postman just now ; and , of course , one can not help being curious .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 10]: -- Have you come to tell us anything nice ?
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 9]: Did Uncle Bernard remember us at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 11]: `` He has left your sister his wife 's rubies .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 15]: They are very beautiful , I am told , and of considerable value . ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 7]: `` Oh , I am glad !
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 18]: Ruth will be pleased ; and she will be able to wear them when she is married .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 6]: How beautiful she will look !
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 6]: And -- and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 5]: Jack shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 3]: `` Nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 14]: Not even a word to say he forgave me for coming away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 6]: `` There is a letter .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 7]: You will see it later on .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 14]: What I meant was that your name was not mentioned in the will .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 7]: He left you no legacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 15]: Mollie sat down in the easy-chair , and leant her head against the cushions .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 27]: In spite of all that had passed , in spite of every determination to be prepared for the worst , the blow fell with crushing weight .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 35]: She was conscious of a feeling of physical weakness , as if the body shared with the mind in grieving over the vanished dream ; but she tried bravely to smile and look unconcerned .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 13]: `` Then I suppose he -- Victor Druce -- inherits all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 8]: Jack looked at her with anxious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 9]: `` You expected it , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 5]: You are not surprised ?
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 16]: It seems to have been generally taken for granted for the last six months . ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 8]: `` Yes ; so Mrs Thornton said .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 14]: If it had been anyone else I should not grudge it so much .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 7]: And you are left out too !
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 13]: I wish -- oh , I wish it had been different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 13]: Jack Melland took a step forward , and bent over her chair .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 15]: `` Mollie , '' he said softly , `` shall we console each other ?
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 15]: I have been waiting until this question was settled before coming to see you .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 19]: It seemed an endless time to wait , but I could n't come till I knew the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 29]: How could a poor fellow , with a few beggarly hundreds a year , approach a girl who might be one of the biggest heiresses in the kingdom ?
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 12]: But I did n't forget you -- I could n't forget .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 10]: I have been thinking of you night and day .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 23]: It was all the harder to be silent when you were in trouble ; but it was the straight thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 14]: You ca n't tell what it means to me to see you again !
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 58]: When you opened the door just now , and the lamp-light showed me your little golden head -- '' He broke off , with the same strange quiver in his voice which had marked his first utterance of her name ; but Mollie shrank back still further in her chair , staring at him with troubled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 6]: I do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 22]: `` It 's simple enough -- only that I love you , and want you to love me in return ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 8]: `` But -- do n't you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 18]: -- you told me about her -- the girl you met , and loved at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 41]: Suppose you met her again , and felt the same ; then you would be sorry if I -- '' `` Oh , Mollie , do you mean to say you have remembered all this time , and never guessed !
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 12]: It was yourself , darling ; there never was anyone else !
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 33]: I think I must have cared for you from the first , though I did not realise it , for I was irritated that I could never get you to be serious .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 25]: You were like a child out for a holiday -- full of fun and mischief -- and I wanted to talk of deeper things .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 40]: Then one day for a moment you showed me a glimpse of your real self -- the sweet , womanly heart that lay beneath the gaiety ; and as I looked at your face I recognised it , Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 25]: It was something I had dreamed of when I did not know I was dreaming , and wanted , without knowing what I wanted !
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 27]: I saw that look again five minutes after I had told you of my lost love , as you looked at me and wished me happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 8]: Why did you look sad , Mollie ?
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 10]: Were you -- were you sorry at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 17]: Mollie put her hand to her side with a gesture as natural as it was charming .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 9]: `` It hurt , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 45]: `` I never , never dreamt that you meant me , and I have tried hard not to think of you ever since ; but I did n't succeed very well ... Why did you always write to Ruth instead of to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 27]: Jack laughed happily , and with a lover 's privilege seated himself on the arm of the easy-chair , and took Mollie 's hands in his .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 16]: `` Because , as I told you before , you darling , I was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 33]: And do you really think you could make up your mind to marry me on next to nothing , and live in a tiny house , and wrestle with the household bills ?
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 10]: Do you think I am worth the sacrifice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 8]: Mollie smiled at him , shyly confident .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 16]: `` I 'm so improvident that I 'm afraid I 'd marry you on nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 11]: I have n't a copper of my own , remember .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 7]: You will have a penniless bride .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 22]: Oh , I wish more than ever that Uncle Bernard had left me something , so that I might help you !
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 18]: It does seem hard , does n't it , that Victor Druce should get it all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 14]: Jack hesitated a moment , tugging at his moustache with his unoccupied hand .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 10]: `` I did n't say that , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: I never told you that he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 4]: `` Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 28]: The name slipped out so naturally on the surprise of the moment that there was a prolonged interval in the conversation , while Jack acknowledged the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 11]: Then Mollie returned to the attack , laughing and rosy .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 8]: `` You asked if I were surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 10]: You said everyone had taken it for granted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 7]: `` Exactly ; so I did .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 7]: But for once everyone was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 10]: Druce has not come in for the property . ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 22]: `` Then , who -- who -- '' `` Someone equally unworthy -- an ungracious rascal of a fellow called Melland .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 15]: It is all mine , Mollie -- all that there is to leave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 41]: And then Jack did a pretty thing -- a thing that he would have sneered at as high-flown and sentimental a few months before ; but no man really knows himself or his capabilities till he loves and is beloved .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 16]: He slipped off his seat , and knelt on the floor at Mollie 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 44]: `` And I have come to you , '' he said gravely , `` to ask you to share it with me , for it 's worth nothing , and worse than nothing , if I have not you by my side ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 28]: He held out his hand as he spoke , and Mollie laid hers in it , while her face confronted him , white and tense with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 12]: `` I ca n't -- I ca n't believe it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 6]: `` It is too wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 4]: You and me !
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 47]: That lovely , lovely place ; and we the masters of it , able to do as we like -- just as we like , all the summer days , and the winter days , and the beautiful spring , and no more anxiety and trouble !
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 5]: Jack -- Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 25]: Her head went down on his shoulder , and he held her fast while she shed a few natural tears of joy and thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 9]: `` My poor girl -- my dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 17]: Yes , it is all over , and the money is as much yours as mine .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 28]: I feel sure Mr Farrell meant it to be so , and that you will find something to that effect in this letter he has left you .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 19]: He discovered my secret before I left Raby , and said plainly how much he wished it success .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 8]: There , darling , read your letter !
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 14]: I hope you may find some kind words to comfort your heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 12]: Mollie broke open the envelope , which he handed to her .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 26]: It was a solemn business , reading a message from the dead , and her big eyes looked quite awestruck as they scanned the page .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 34]: There were only a few words , written in a small , tremulous hand : -- `` My dear Mollie , -- I leave you nothing , hoping that you may share all .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 20]: That is my strong wish , and I believe I am helping on your happiness by an apparent neglect .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 10]: Try to forgive me for refusing your last request .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 34]: It would have been easier to consent , but I considered that a short period of anxiety would be a blessing in disguise , if it showed you who were your true friends .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 26]: If a man comes forward and offers you his love in the days of obscurity and poverty , that man 's love is worth having .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 10]: I hope and believe it will come to you .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 11]: I thank you for your kindness to an old man .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 14]: Forgive him for all his offences , foremost among them an unfounded suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 10]: -- Your friend and kinsman , Bernard Farrell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 8]: You see how right I was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 5]: cried Jack in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 21]: `` In effect , we are joint heirs , and have equally free hands in the disposal of the money .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 43]: You must settle an income on your mother which will ensure her against anxiety , and then you can come away with an easy mind , and help me to turn into a country squire and learn my duties to the tenants .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 28]: You told me once that he would be hard-worked if he were conscientious , and I want to do the thing well while I am about it .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 4]: This is December .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 12]: I mean to be married in January , at latest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 10]: Mollie laughed , but with a somewhat tremulous sound .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 30]: The change of scene which had taken place within the last quarter of an hour was so complete , so extraordinary , that she felt dazed by the shock .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 30]: Not only had undreamed-of happiness come to herself , but with it such relief and ease for all belonging to her , that they would rejoice equally with herself .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 46]: It did indeed seem more like a dream than a reality , as , with Jack 's arm round her waist and her head resting contentedly upon Jack 's shoulder , they drifted off into one of those delightful conversations which follow all happy betrothals .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 6]: `` Do you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 3]: queried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 6]: `` Do you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 3]: echoed Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 10]: `` What did you mean when you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 10]: `` How did you feel when you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 8]: `` When did you first begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 46]: `` And are you quite sure you will never , never -- '' It is all as old as the hills , and as new as to-morrow morning , though each separate pair of lovers imagine in their innocence that they own the exclusive monopoly .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 4]: `` Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 15]: cried Mollie at last , sitting suddenly upright and clasping her hands in amaze .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 6]: `` Jack , imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 13]: All this time I have forgotten the most thrilling part of all .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 7]: The condition -- the mysterious condition !
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 20]: What did you do , or leave undone , which made you different from the rest of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 2]: CONCLUSION .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 3]: cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 10]: `` I wondered when you were coming to that !
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 12]: It was indeed something of which we could never have thought !
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 82]: Mr Farrell had learnt by sad experience that real happiness can not be purchased by money , so had determined to leave his fortune to the one who cared for it least -- that is to say , to the one who put other things first -- love -- whole-hearted , disinterested love , such as he himself had felt for his beautiful wife ; and honest work , enjoyed for its own sake more than for what it will bring !
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 24]: Ruth was out of the running from the start , for she showed so plainly that , to her , money meant happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 40]: There must have been a time when he wavered in favour of Druce , who played his part remarkably well ; but on the whole , it was my obstinate , ungracious self which approached nearest to his ideal .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 45]: He knew that I loved you , but that I should never venture to ask you to be my wife if you were a great heiress ; so as he himself writes , he left you nothing , hoping that you would share all .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 26]: I want you literally to realise that , darling -- and to feel that the money belongs as much to you as to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 11]: Mollie smiled at him in her sunny , candid fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 7]: `` Oh , I shall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 4]: she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 5]: `` I mean to .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 28]: There are so many things that I want to do for the dear people here , and they would like them better if they came from me .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 22]: Uncle Bernard was a dear , sweet old thing to scheme for our happiness , and I adore him for it .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 48]: I certainly put love before money , for I would marry you if we had to play an organ in the streets or sing sentimental ditties out of tune , but it will be like a fairy tale to live in the Court -- with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 6]: `` It will , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 17]: I do n't feel indifferent to fortune any longer now that it has brought us together .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 23]: When the Will was read aloud yesterday , I did not know whether I was standing on my head or my heels .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 24]: I rushed down to the vicarage , and good little Mrs Thornton cried upon my neck , literally she did , Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 8]: Mollie smiled at him with love-lit eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 13]: `` But oh , Jack , there 's something else -- Victor ?
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 4]: What about him ?
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 5]: Was he terribly disappointed ?
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 6]: Did he get nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 5]: not a cent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 13]: `` Did Uncle Bernard leave no word of explanation or good-bye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 22]: `` There was no note , but there was an envelope and an -- an enclosure , '' said Jack gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 16]: He put his hand in his waistcoat-pocket and drew from his pocket-book an unmounted photograph .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 34]: `` Druce opened this in the library after the Will was read , stared at it for a moment , then threw it in the fire , and dashed out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 18]: It fell on the grate and the lawyer picked it up and gave it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 16]: He held out the photograph as he spoke , and Mollie bent eagerly over it .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 38]: It was Ruth 's missing picture of the library at the Court -- one of the longtime exposures which she had taken on the eventful morning when the desk had been opened in the squire 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 57]: The nearer part of the interior was clear and distinct , but the further half was blurred as if something had moved while the plate was still exposed , while leaning over the open desk was a man 's figure , dim and blurred indeed , but recognisable in a flash as that of Victor Druce !
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 27]: Mollie 's face was white to the lips as she raised it to meet Jack 's glance , and he put his arm round her protectingly .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 10]: `` Yes ; I knew you would be shocked !
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 8]: It is easy to see what happened .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 23]: After Druce went out , ostensibly for the day , he slunk back unseen , and entered the library by the window .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 15]: The blur across the picture shows in which direction he crossed to the desk .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 34]: Meantime , Ruth had put her camera in position , and as the exposure would be a long one in such a dark room , she had gone away and left it there .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 48]: Druce would never notice the little camera perched on a side-table , and when he heard Ruth returning he , no doubt , hid himself hastily behind the curtains ; but he had remained sufficiently long at the desk to give a definite impression of his figure .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 19]: The camera was discovered after you left , and the squire had the plates developed in the village .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 34]: He must have had the curiosity to examine them before sending them on , and one can imagine his feelings upon finding the solution of the mystery which had troubled him so much .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 20]: I have no sympathy for Mr Victor Druce ; I am only profoundly thankful that Ruth escaped his clutches .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 10]: Do n't let us talk of him any more .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 13]: We want only pleasant subjects on this great night , sweetheart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 12]: `` And there are so many pleasant subjects to think of .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 29]: It will be such a lovely experience to play fairy godmother to people who have had a bad time ; the first of all comes the dear pater .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 8]: There 's his key in the latch !
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 16]: Be nice to him , Jack ; he has been so good to us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 6]: `` Come , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 13]: said Jack , rising , and holding out his hand towards her .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 32]: `` Let us go to meet him together , and you shall tell him that he has a new son , and that all his troubles are at an end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 3]: THE END .
