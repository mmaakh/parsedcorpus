Parsing [sent. 90 len. 4]: CONCLUSION WILFRID CUMBERMEDE .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 2]: INTRODUCTION .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 16]: I am -- I will not say how old , but well past middle age .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 55]: This much I feel compelled to mention , because it has long been my opinion that no man should attempt a history of himself until he has set foot upon the border land where the past and the future begin to blend in a consciousness somewhat independent of both , and hence interpreting both .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 31]: Looking westward , from this vantage-ground , the setting sun is not the less lovely to him that he recalls a merrier time when the shadows fell the other way .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 25]: Then they sped westward before him , as if to vanish , chased by his advancing footsteps , over the verge of the world .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 12]: Now they come creeping towards him , lengthening as they come .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 5]: And they are welcome .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: Can it be that he would ever have chosen a world without shadows ?
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 13]: Was not the trouble of the shadowless noon the dreariest of all ?
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 14]: Did he not then long for the curtained queen -- the all-shadowy night ?
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 15]: And shall he now regard with dismay the setting sun of his earthly life ?
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 20]: When he looks back , he sees the farthest cloud of the sun-deserted east alive with a rosy hue .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 11]: It is the prophecy of the sunset concerning the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 22]: For the sun itself is ever a rising sun , and the morning will come though the night should be dark .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 153]: In this ` season of calm weather , ' when the past has receded so far that he can behold it as in a picture , and his share in it as the history of a man who had lived and would soon die ; when he can confess his faults without the bitterness of shame , both because he is humble , and because the faults themselves have dropped from him ; when his good deeds look poverty-stricken in his eyes , and he would no more claim consideration for them than expect knighthood because he was no thief ; when he cares little for his reputation , but much for his character -- little for what has gone beyond his control , but endlessly much for what yet remains in his will to determine ; then , I think , a man may do well to write his own life .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 25]: ` So , ' I imagine my reader interposing , ` you profess to have arrived at this high degree of perfection yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 37]: I reply that the man who has attained this kind of indifference to the past , this kind of hope in the future , will be far enough from considering it a high degree of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 10]: The very idea is to such a man ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 25]: One may eat bread without claiming the honours of an athlete ; one may desire to be honest and not count himself a saint .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 61]: My object in thus shadowing out what seems to me my present condition of mind , is merely to render it intelligible to my reader how an autobiography might come to be written without rendering the writer justly liable to the charge of that overweening , or self-conceit , which might be involved in the mere conception of the idea .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 41]: In listening to similar recitals from the mouths of elderly people , I have observed that many things which seemed to the persons principally concerned ordinary enough , had to me a wonder and a significance they did not perceive .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 64]: Let me hope that some of the things I am about to relate may fare similarly , although , to be honest , I must confess I could not have undertaken the task , for a task it is , upon this chance alone : I do think some of my history worthy of being told , just for the facts ' sake .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 11]: God knows I have had small share of that worthiness .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 27]: The weakness of my life has been that I would ever do some great thing ; the saving of my life has been my utter failure .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 8]: I have never done a great deed .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 18]: If I had , I know that one of my temperament could not have escaped serious consequences .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 49]: I have had more pleasure when a grown man in a certain discovery concerning the ownership of an apple of which I had taken the ancestral bite when a boy , than I can remember to have resulted from any action of my own during my whole existence .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 28]: But I detest the notion of puzzling my reader in order to enjoy her fancied surprise , or her possible praise of a worthless ingenuity of concealment .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 62]: If I ever appear to behave thus , it is merely that I follow the course of my own knowledge of myself and my affairs , without any desire to give either the pain or the pleasure of suspense , if indeed I may flatter myself with the hope of interesting her to such a degree that suspense should become possible .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 34]: When I look over what I have written , I find the tone so sombre -- let me see : what sort of an evening is it on which I commence this book ?
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 8]: I thought so : a sombre evening .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 25]: The sun is going down behind a low bank of grey cloud , the upper edge of which he tinges with a faded yellow .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: There will be rain before morning .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 14]: It is late Autumn , and most of the crops are gathered in .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 10]: A bluish fog is rising from the lower meadows .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 7]: As I look I grow cold .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 10]: It is not , somehow , an interesting evening .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 19]: Yet if I found just this evening well described in a novel , I should enjoy it heartily .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 50]: The poorest , weakest drizzle upon the window-panes of a dreary roadside inn in a country of slate-quarries , possesses an interest to him who enters it by the door of a book , hardly less than the pouring rain which threatens to swell every brook to a torrent .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 4]: How is this ?
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 41]: I think it is because your troubles do not enter into the book and its troubles do not enter into you , and therefore nature operates upon you unthwarted by the personal conditions which so often counteract her present influences .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 81]: But I will rather shut out the fading west , the gathering mists , and the troubled consciousness of nature altogether , light my fire and my pipe , and then try whether in my first chapter I can not be a boy again in such fashion that my companion , that is , my reader , will not be too impatient to linger a little in the meadows of childhood ere we pass to the corn-fields of riper years .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 7]: CHAPTER I. WHERE I FIND MYSELF .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 56]: No wisest chicken , I presume , can recall the first moment when the chalk-oval surrounding it gave way , and instead of the cavern of limestone which its experience might have led it to expect , it found a world of air and movement and freedom and blue sky -- with kites in it .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 34]: For my own part , I often wished , when a child , that I had watched while God was making me , so that I might have remembered how he did it .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 56]: Now my wonder is whether , when I creep forth into ` that new world which is the old , ' I shall be conscious of the birth , and enjoy the whole mighty surprise , or whether I shall become gradually aware that things are changed and stare about me like the new-born baby .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 13]: What will be the candle-flame that shall first attract my new-born sight ?
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 18]: But I forget that speculation about the new life is not writing the history of the old .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 12]: I have often tried how far back my memory could go .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 71]: I suspect there are awfully ancient shadows mingling with our memories ; but , as far as I can judge , the earliest definite memory I have is the discovery of how the wind is made ; for I saw the process going on before my very eyes , and there could be , and there was , no doubt of the relation of cause and effect in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 26]: There were the trees swaying themselves about after the wildest fashion , and there was the wind in consequence visiting my person somewhat too roughly .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 8]: The trees were blowing in my face .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 11]: They made the wind , and threw it at me .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 14]: I used my natural senses , and this was what they told me .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 29]: The discovery impressed me so deeply that even now I can not look upon trees without a certain indescribable and , but for this remembrance , unaccountable awe .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 60]: A grove was to me for many years a fountain of winds , and , in the stillest day , to look into a depth of gathered stems filled me with dismay ; for the whole awful assembly might , writhing together in earnest and effectual contortion , at any moment begin their fearful task of churning the wind .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 15]: There were no trees in the neighbourhood of the house where I was born .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 26]: It stood in the midst of grass , and nothing but grass was to be seen for a long way on every side of it .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 12]: There was not a gravel path or a road near it .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 13]: Its walls , old and rusty , rose immediately from the grass .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 57]: Green blades and a few heads of daisies leaned trustingly against the brown stone , all the sharpness of whose fractures had long since vanished , worn away by the sun and the rain , or filled up by the slow lichens , which I used to think were young stones growing out of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 28]: The ground was part of a very old dairy-farm , and my uncle , to whom it belonged , would not have a path about the place .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 47]: But then the grass was well subdued by the cows , and , indeed , I think , would never have grown very long , for it was of that delicate sort which we see only on downs and in parks and on old grazing farms .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 49]: All about the house -- as far , at least , as my lowly eyes could see -- the ground was perfectly level , and this lake of greenery , out of which it rose like a solitary rock , was to me an unfailing mystery and delight .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 37]: This will sound strange in the ears of those who consider a mountainous , or at least an undulating , surface essential to beauty ; but nature is altogether independent of what is called fine scenery .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 27]: There are other organs than the eyes , even if grass and water and sky were not of the best and loveliest of nature 's shows .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 21]: The house , I have said , was of an ancient-looking stone , grey and green and yellow and brown .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 20]: It looked very hard ; yet there were some attempts at carving about the heads of the narrow windows .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 35]: The carving had , however , become so dull and shadowy that I could not distinguish a single form or separable portion of design : still some ancient thought seemed ever flickering across them .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 23]: The house , which was two stories in height , had a certain air of defence about it , ill to explain .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 26]: It had no eaves , for the walls rose above the edge of the roof ; but the hints at battlements were of the merest .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 22]: The roof , covered with grey slates , rose very steep , and had narrow , tall dormer windows in it .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 22]: The edges of the gables rose , not in a slope , but in a succession of notches , like stairs .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 59]: Altogether , the shell to which , considered as a crustaceous animal , I belonged -- for man is every animal according as you choose to contemplate him -- had an old-world look about it -- a look of the time when men had to fight in order to have peace , to kill in order to live .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 36]: Being , however , a crustaceous animal , I , the heir of all the new impulses of the age , was born and reared in closest neighbourhood with strange relics of a vanished time .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 19]: Humanity so far retains its chief characteristics that the new generations can always flourish in the old shell .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 22]: The dairy was at some distance , so deep in a hollow that a careless glance would not have discovered it .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 34]: I well remember my astonishment when my aunt first took me there ; for I had not even observed the depression of surface : all had been a level green to my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 27]: Beyond this hollow were fields divided by hedges , and lanes , and the various goings to and fro of a not unpeopled although quiet neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 26]: Until I left home for school , however , I do not remember to have seen a carriage of any kind approach our solitary dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 36]: My uncle would have regarded it as little short of an insult for any one to drive wheels over the smooth lawny surface in which our house dwelt like a solitary island in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 24]: Before the threshold lay a brown patch , worn bare of grass , and beaten hard by the descending feet of many generations .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 13]: The stone threshold itself was worn almost to a level with it .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 41]: A visitor 's first step was into what would , in some parts , be called the house-place , a room which served all the purposes of a kitchen , and yet partook of the character of an old hall .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 50]: It rose to a fair height , with smoke-stained beams above ; and was floored with a kind of cement , hard enough , and yet so worn that it required a good deal of local knowledge to avoid certain jars of the spine from sudden changes of level .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 71]: All the furniture was dark and shining , especially the round table , which , with its bewildering , spider-like accumulation of legs , waited under the mullioned , lozenged window until meal-times , when , like an animal roused from its lair , it stretched out those legs , and assumed expanded and symmetrical shape in front of the fire in Winter , and nearer the door in Summer .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 99]: It recalls the vision of my aunt , with a hand at each end of it , searching empirically for the level -- feeling for it , that is , with the creature 's own legs -- before lifting the hanging-leaves , and drawing out the hitherto supernumerary legs to support them ; after which would come a fresh adjustment of level , another hustling to and fro , that the new feet likewise might settle on elevations of equal height ; and then came the snowy cloth or the tea-tray , deposited cautiously upon its shining surface .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 22]: The walls of this room were always whitewashed in the Spring , occasioning ever a sharpened contrast with the dark-brown ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 19]: Whether that was even swept I do not know ; I do not remember ever seeing it done .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 13]: At all events , its colour remained unimpaired by paint or whitewash .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 25]: On the walls hung various articles , some of them high above my head , and attractive for that reason if for no other .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 44]: I never saw one of them moved from its place -- not even the fishing-rod , which required the whole length betwixt the two windows : three rusty hooks hung from it , and waved about when a wind entered ruder than common .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 20]: Over the fishing-rod hung a piece of tapestry , about a yard in width , and longer than that .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 34]: It would have required a very capable constructiveness indeed to supply the design from what remained , so fragmentary were the forms , and so dim and faded were the once bright colours .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 43]: It was there as an ornament ; for that which is a mere complement of higher modes of life , becomes , when useless , the ornament of lower conditions : what we call great virtues are little regarded by the saints .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 29]: It was long before I began to think how the tapestry could have come there , or to what it owed the honour given it in the house .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 29]: On the opposite wall hung another object , which may well have been the cause of my carelessness about the former -- attracting to itself all my interest .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 10]: It was a sword , in a leather sheath .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 22]: From the point , half way to the hilt , the sheath was split all along the edge of the weapon .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 17]: The sides of the wound gaped , and the blade was visible to my prying eyes .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 16]: It was with rust almost as dark a brown as the scabbard that infolded it .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 21]: But the under parts of the hilt , where dust could not settle , gleamed with a faint golden shine .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 30]: That sword was to my childish eyes the type of all mystery , a clouded glory , which for many long years I never dreamed of attempting to unveil .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 36]: Not the sword Excalibur , had it been ` stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings , ' could have radiated more marvel into the hearts of young knights than that sword radiated into mine .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 168]: Night after night I would dream of danger drawing nigh -- crowds of men of evil purpose -- enemies to me or to my country ; and ever in the beginning of my dream , I stood ready , foreknowing and waiting ; for I had climbed and had taken the ancient power from the wall , and had girded it about my waist -- always with a straw rope , the sole band within my reach ; but as it went on , the power departed from the dream : I stood waiting for foes who would not come ; or they drew near in fury , and when I would have drawn my weapon , old blood and rust held it fast in its sheath , and I tugged at it in helpless agony ; and fear invaded my heart , and I turned and fled , pursued by my foes until I left the dream itself behind , whence the terror still pursued me .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 9]: There were many things more on those walls .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 16]: A pair of spurs , of make modern enough , hung between two pewter dish-covers .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 45]: Hanging book-shelves came next ; for although most of my uncle 's books were in his bed-room , some of the commoner were here on the wall , next to an old fowling-piece , of which both lock and barrel were devoured with rust .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 37]: Then came a great pair of shears , though how they should have been there I can not yet think , for there was no garden to the house , no hedges or trees to clip .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 8]: I need not linger over these things .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 20]: Their proper place is in the picture with which I would save words and help understanding if I could .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 37]: Of course there was a great chimney in the place ; chiefly to be mentioned from the singular fact that just round its corner was a little door opening on a rude winding stair of stone .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 38]: This appeared to be constructed within the chimney ; but on the outside of the wall , was a half-rounded projection , revealing that the stair was not indebted to it for the whole of its accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 15]: Whither the stair led , I shall have to disclose in my next chapter .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 77]: From the opposite end of the kitchen , an ordinary wooden staircase , with clumsy balustrade , led up to the two bed-rooms occupied by my uncle and my aunt ; to a large lumber-room , whose desertion and almost emptiness was a source of uneasiness in certain moods ; and to a spare bed-room , which was better furnished than any of ours , and indeed to my mind a very grand and spacious apartment .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 20]: This last was never occupied during my childhood ; consequently it smelt musty notwithstanding my aunt 's exemplary housekeeping .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 10]: Its bedsteads must have been hundreds of years old .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 21]: Above these rooms again were those to which the dormer windows belonged , and in one of them I slept .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 49]: It had a deep closet in which I kept my few treasures , and into which I used to retire when out of temper or troubled , conditions not occurring frequently , for nobody quarrelled with me , and I had nobody with whom I might have quarrelled .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 20]: When I climbed upon a chair , I could seat myself on the broad sill of the dormer window .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 10]: This was the watch-tower whence I viewed the world .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 24]: Thence I could see trees in the distance -- too far off for me to tell whether they were churning wind or not .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 13]: On that side those trees alone were between me and the sky .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 27]: One day when my aunt took me with her into the lumber-room , I found there , in a corner , a piece of strange mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 60]: It had a kind of pendulum ; but I can not describe it because I had lost sight of it long before I was capable of discovering its use , and my recollection of it is therefore very vague -- far too vague to admit of even a conjecture now as to what it could have been intended for .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 23]: But I remember well enough my fancy concerning it , though when or how that fancy awoke I can not tell either .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 13]: It seems to me as old as the finding of the instrument .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 50]: The fancy was that if I could keep that pendulum wagging long enough , it would set all those trees going too ; and if I still kept it swinging , we should have such a storm of wind as no living man had ever felt or heard of .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 105]: That I more than half believed it , will be evident from the fact that , although I frequently carried the pendulum , as I shall call it , to the window sill , and set it in motion by way of experiment , I had not , up to the time of a certain incident which I shall very soon have to relate , had the courage to keep up the oscillation beyond ten or a dozen strokes ; partly from fear of the trees , partly from a dim dread of exercising power whose source and extent were not within my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 20]: I kept the pendulum in the closet I have mentioned , and never spoke to any one of it .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 5]: MY UNCLE AND AUNT .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 6]: We were a curious household .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 25]: I remembered neither father nor mother ; and the woman I had been taught to call _ auntie _ was no such near relation .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 21]: My uncle was my father 's brother , and my aunt was his cousin , by the mother 's side .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 21]: She was a tall , gaunt woman , with a sharp nose and eager eyes , yet sparing of speech .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 14]: Indeed , there was very little speech to be heard in the house .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 13]: My aunt , however , looked as if she could have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 21]: I think it was the spirit of the place that kept her silent , for there were those eager eyes .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 21]: She might have been expected also to show a bad temper , but I never saw a sign of such .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 27]: To me she was always kind ; chiefly , I allow , in a negative way , leaving me to do very much as I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 22]: I doubt if she felt any great tenderness for me , although I had been dependent upon her care from infancy .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 58]: In after-years I came to the conclusion that she was in love with my uncle ; and perhaps the sense that he was indifferent to her save after a brotherly fashion , combined with the fear of betraying herself and the consciousness of her unattractive appearance , to produce the contradiction between her looks and her behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 22]: Every morning , after our early breakfast , my uncle walked away to the farm , where he remained until dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 113]: Often , when busy at my own invented games in the grass , I have caught sight of my aunt , standing motionless with her hand over her eyes , watching for the first glimpse of my uncle ascending from the hollow where the farm-buildings lay ; and occasionally , when something had led her thither as well , I would watch them returning together over the grass , when she would keep glancing up in his face at almost regular intervals , although it was evident they were not talking , but he never turned his face or lifted his eyes from the ground a few yards in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 19]: He was a tall man of nearly fifty , with grey hair , and quiet meditative blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 9]: He always looked as if he were thinking .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 48]: He had been intended for the Church , but the means for the prosecution of his studies failing , he had turned his knowledge of rustic affairs to account , and taken a subordinate position on a nobleman 's estate , where he rose to be bailiff .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 20]: When my father was seized with his last illness , he returned to take the management of the farm .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 10]: It had been in the family for many generations .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 16]: Indeed that portion of it upon which the house stood , was our own property .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 18]: When my mother followed my father , my uncle asked his cousin to keep house for him .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 16]: Perhaps she had expected a further request , but more had not come of it .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: When he came in , my uncle always went straight to his room ; and having washed his hands and face , took a book and sat down in the window .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 21]: If I were sent to tell him that the meal was ready , I was sure to find him reading .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 33]: He would look up , smile , and look down at his book again ; nor , until I had formally delivered my message , would he take further notice of me .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 20]: Then he would rise , lay his book carefully aside , take my hand , and lead me down-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 13]: To my childish eyes there was something very grand about my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 15]: His face was large-featured and handsome ; he was tall , and stooped meditatively .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 22]: I think my respect for him was founded a good deal upon the reverential way in which my aunt regarded him .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 22]: And there was great wisdom , I came to know , behind that countenance , a golden speech behind that silence .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 15]: My reader must not imagine that the prevailing silence of the house oppressed me .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 13]: I had been brought up in it , and never felt it .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 71]: My own thoughts , if thoughts those conditions of mind could be called , which were chiefly passive results of external influences -- whatever they were -- thoughts or feelings , sensations , or dim , slow movements of mind -- they filled the great pauses of speech ; and besides , I could read the faces of both my uncle and aunt like the pages of a well-known book .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 18]: Every shade of alteration in them I was familiar with , for their changes were not many .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 23]: Although my uncle 's habit was silence , however , he would now and then take a fit of talking to me .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 19]: I remember many such talks ; the better , perhaps , that they were divided by long intervals .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 14]: I had perfect confidence in his wisdom , and submission to his will .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 8]: I did not much mind my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 20]: Perhaps her deference to my uncle made me feel as if she and I were more on a level .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 16]: She must have been really kind , for she never resented any petulance or carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 34]: Possibly she sacrificed her own feeling to the love my uncle bore me ; but I think it was rather that , because he cared for me , she cared for me too .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 30]: Twice during every meal she would rise from the table with some dish in her hand , open the door behind the chimney , and ascend the winding stair .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 7]: AT THE TOP OF THE CHIMNEY-STAIR .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 31]: I fear my reader may have thought me too long occupied with the explanatory foundations of my structure : I shall at once proceed to raise its walls of narrative .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 19]: Whatever further explanations may be necessary , can be applied as buttresses in lieu of a broader base .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 70]: One Sunday -- it was his custom of a Sunday -- I fancy I was then somewhere about six years of age -- my uncle rose from the table after our homely dinner , took me by the hand , and led me to the dark door with the long arrow-headed hinges , and up the winding stone stair which I never ascended except with him or my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 18]: At the top was another rugged door , and within that , one covered with green baize .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 17]: The last opened on what had always seemed to me a very paradise of a room .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 28]: It was old-fashioned enough ; but childhood is of any and every age , and it was not old-fashioned to me -- only intensely cosy and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 33]: The first thing my eyes generally rested upon was an old bureau , with a book-case on the top of it , the glass-doors of which were lined with faded red silk .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 24]: The next thing I would see was a small tent-bed , with the whitest of curtains , and enchanting fringes of white ball-tassels .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 13]: The bed was covered with an equally charming counterpane of silk patchwork .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 48]: The next object was the genius of the place , in a high , close , easy-chair , covered with some dark stuff , against which her face , surrounded with its widow 's cap , of ancient form , but dazzling whiteness , was strongly relieved .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 33]: How shall I describe the shrunken , yet delicate , the gracious , if not graceful form , and the face from which extreme old age had not wasted half the loveliness ?
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 24]: Yet I always beheld it with an indescribable sensation , one of whose elements I can isolate and identify as a faint fear .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 51]: Perhaps this arose partly from the fact that , in going up the stair , more than once my uncle had said to me , ` You must not mind what grannie says , Willie , for old people will often speak strange things that young people can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 16]: But you must love grannie , for she is a very good old lady . '
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 11]: ` Well , grannie , how are you to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 12]: said my uncle , as we entered , this particular Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 32]: I may as well mention at once that my uncle called her _ grannie _ in his own right and not in mine , for she was in truth my great-grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 56]: ` Pretty well , David , I thank you ; but much too long out of my grave , ' answered grannie ; in no sepulchral tones , however , for her voice , although weak and uneven , had a sound in it like that of one of the upper strings of a violin .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 36]: The plaintiveness of it touched me , and I crept near her -- nearer than , I believe , I had ever yet gone of my own will -- and laid my hand upon hers .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 24]: I withdrew it instantly , for there was something in the touch that made me -- not shudder , exactly -- but creep .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 20]: Her hand was smooth and soft , and warm too , only somehow the skin of it seemed dead .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 33]: With a quicker movement than belonged to her years , she caught hold of mine , which she kept in one of her hands , while she stroked it with the other .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 27]: My slight repugnance vanished for the time , and I looked up in her face , grateful for a tenderness which was altogether new to me .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 14]: ` What makes you so long out of your grave , grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 13]: ` They wo n't let me into it , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 10]: ` Who wo n't let you , grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 14]: ` My own grandson there , and the woman down the stair . '
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 17]: ` But you do n't really want to go -- do you , grannie ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 8]: I do want to go , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: I ought to have been there long ago .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 16]: I am very old ; so old that I 've forgotten how old I am .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 6]: How old am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: she asked , looking up at my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 28]: ` Nearly ninety-five , grannie ; and the older you get before you go the better we shall be pleased , as you know very well . '
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 24]: I told you , ' she said with a smile , not all of pleasure , as she turned her head towards me .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 8]: ` They wo n't let me go .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 15]: I want to go to my grave , and they wo n't let me !
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 16]: Is that an age at which to keep a poor woman from her grave ? '
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 15]: ` But it 's not a nice place , is it , grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 16]: I asked , with the vaguest ideas of what _ the grave _ meant . '
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 12]: I think somebody told me it was in the churchyard . '
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 31]: But neither did I know with any clearness what the church itself meant , for we were a long way from church , and I had never been there yet .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 13]: ` Yes , it is in the churchyard , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 7]: ` Is it a house ? '
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 15]: ` Yes , a little house ; just big enough for one . ' '
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 7]: I should n't like that . '
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 8]: ` Oh yes , you would . '
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 10]: ` Is it a nice place , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 21]: ` Yes , the nicest place in the world , when you get to be so old as I am .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 9]: If they would only let me die ! '
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 6]: ` Die , grannie ! '
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 34]: My notions of death as yet were derived only from the fowls brought from the farm , with their necks hanging down long and limp , and their heads wagging hither and thither .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 24]: ` Come , grannie , you must n't frighten our little man , ' interposed my uncle , looking kindly at us both .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 4]: ` David ! '
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 19]: said grannie , with a reproachful dignity , ' _ you _ know what I mean well enough .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 29]: You know that until I have done what I have to do , the grave that is waiting for me will not open its mouth to receive me .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 21]: If you will only allow me to do what I have to do , I shall not trouble you long .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 4]: oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 30]: she broke out , moaning and rocking herself to and fro , ' I am too old to weep , and they will not let me to my bed .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 7]: I want to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 8]: I want to go to sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 8]: She moaned and complained like a child .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 9]: My uncle went near and took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: ` Come , come , dear grannie ! '
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: he said , ` you must not behave like this .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 10]: You know all things are for the best . '
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 11]: ` To keep a corpse out of its grave ! '
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 19]: retorted the old lady , almost fiercely , only she was too old and weak to be fierce .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 25]: ` Why should you keep a soul that 's longing to depart and go to its own people , lingering on in the coffin ?
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 10]: What better than a coffin is this withered body ?
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 9]: The child is old enough to understand me .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 17]: Leave him with me for half an hour , and I shall trouble you no longer .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 10]: I shall at least wait my end in peace .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 11]: But I think I should die before the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 19]: Ere grannie had finished this sentence , I had shrunk from her again and retreated behind my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 13]: she went on , ` you make my own child fear me .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 22]: Do n't be frightened , Willie dear ; your old mother is not a wild beast ; she loves you dearly .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 7]: Only my grand-children are so undutiful !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 12]: They will not let my own son come near me . '
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 20]: How I recall this I do not know , for I could not have understood it at the time .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 36]: The fact is that during the last few years I have found pictures of the past returning upon me in the most vivid and unaccountable manner , so much so as almost to alarm me .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 45]: Things I had utterly forgotten -- or so far at least that when they return , they must appear only as vivid imaginations , were it not for a certain conviction of fact which accompanies them -- are constantly dawning out of the past .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 19]: Can it be that the decay of the observant faculties allows the memory to revive and gather force ?
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 16]: But I must refrain , for my business is to narrate , not to speculate .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 15]: My uncle took me by the hand , and turned to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 12]: I cast one look at grannie as he led me away .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 25]: She had thrown her head back on her chair , and her eyes were closed ; but her face looked offended , almost angry .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 16]: She looked to my fancy as if she were trying but unable to lie down .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: My uncle closed the doors very gently .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 37]: In the middle of the stair he stopped , and said in a low voice , ` Willie , do you know that when people grow very old they are not quite like other people ? '
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 12]: They want to go to the churchyard , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 10]: ` They fancy things , ' said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 10]: ` Grannie thinks you are her own son . '
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 7]: ` And ai n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 4]: I asked innocently .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 8]: ` Not exactly , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 9]: ` Your father was her son 's son .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 17]: She forgets that , and wants to talk to you as if you were your grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 4]: Poor old grannie !
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 20]: I do n't wish you to go and see her without your aunt or me : mind that . '
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 26]: Whether I made any promise I do not remember ; but I know that a new something was mingled with my life from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 18]: An air as it were of the tomb mingled henceforth with the homely delights of my life .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 12]: Grannie wanted to die , and uncle would not let her .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 13]: She longed for her grave , and they would keep her above-ground .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 78]: And from the feeling that grannie ought to be buried , grew an awful sense that she was not alive -- not alive , that is , as other people are alive , and a gulf was fixed between her and me which for a long time I never attempted to pass , avoiding as much as I could all communication with her , even when my uncle or aunt wished to take me to her room .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 19]: They did not seem displeased , however , when I objected , and not always insisted on obedience .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 18]: Thus affairs went on in our quiet household for what seemed to me a very long time .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 3]: THE PENDULUM .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 30]: It may have been a year after this , it may have been two , I can not tell , when the next great event in my life occurred .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 37]: I think it was towards the close of an Autumn , but there was not so much about our house as elsewhere to mark the changes of the seasons , for the grass was always green .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 8]: I remember it was a sultry afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 24]: I had been out almost the whole day , wandering hither and thither over the grass , and I felt hot and oppressed .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 6]: Not an air was stirring .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 26]: I longed for a breath of wind , for I was not afraid of the wind itself , only of the trees that made it .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 44]: Indeed , I delighted in the wind , and would run against it with exuberant pleasure , even rejoicing in the fancy that I , as well as the trees , could make the wind by shaking my hair about as I ran .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 25]: I must run , however ; whereas the trees , whose prime business it was , could do it without stirring from the spot .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 44]: But this was much too hot an afternoon for me , whose mood was always more inclined to the passive than the active , to run about and toss my hair , even for the sake of the breeze that would result therefrom .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 4]: I bethought myself .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 32]: I was nearly a man now ; I would be afraid of things no more ; I would get out my pendulum , and see whether that would not help me .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: Not this time would I flinch from what consequences might follow .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 22]: Let them be what they might , the pendulum should wag , and have a fair chance of doing its best .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 15]: -LSB- Illustration : `` I SAT AND WATCHED IT WITH GROWING AWE . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 17]: I went up to my room , a sense of high emprise filling my little heart .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 32]: Composedly , yea solemnly , I set to work , even as some enchanter of old might have drawn his circle , and chosen his spell out of his iron-clasped volume .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 12]: I strode to the closet in which the awful instrument dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 7]: It stood in the furthest corner .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 13]: As I lifted it , something like a groan invaded my ear .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 26]: My notions of locality were not then sufficiently developed to let me know that grannie 's room was on the other side of that closet .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: I almost let the creature , for as such I regarded it , drop .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 9]: I was not to be deterred , however .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 28]: I bore it carefully to the light , and set it gently on the window sill , full in view of the distant trees towards the west .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 46]: I left it then for a moment , as if that it might gather its strength for its unwonted labours , while I closed the door , and , with what fancy I can scarcely imagine now , the curtains of my bed as well .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 27]: Possibly it was with some notion of having one place to which , if the worst came to the worst , I might retreat for safety .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 29]: Again I approached the window , and after standing for some time in contemplation of the pendulum , I set it in motion , and stood watching it .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 6]: It swung slower and slower .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 5]: It wanted to stop .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 5]: It should not stop .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 6]: I gave it another swing .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 19]: On it went , at first somewhat distractedly , next more regularly , then with slowly retarding movement .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 6]: But it should not stop .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 39]: I turned in haste and got from the side of my bed the only chair in the room , placed it in the window , sat down before the reluctant instrument , and gave it a third swing .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 23]: Then , my elbows on the sill , I sat and watched it with growing awe , but growing determination as well .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 19]: Once more it showed signs of refusal ; once more the forefinger of my right hand administered impulse .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 18]: Something gave a crack inside the creature : away went the pendulum , swinging with a will .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 8]: I sat and gazed , almost horror-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 35]: Ere many moments had passed , the feeling of terror had risen to such a height that , but for the very terror , I would have seized the pendulum in a frantic grasp .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 4]: I did not .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 9]: On it went , and I sat looking .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 6]: My dismay was gradually subsiding .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 16]: I have learned since that a certain ancestor -- or was he only a great-uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 28]: -- I forget -- had a taste for mechanics , even to the craze of the perpetual motion , and could work well in brass and iron .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 9]: The creature was probably some invention of his .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 22]: It was a real marvel how , after so many years of idleness , it could now go as it did .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 23]: I confess , as I contemplate the thing , I am in a puzzle , and almost fancy the whole a dream .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 5]: But let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 33]: At worst , something of which this is the sole representative residuum , wrought an effect on me which embodies its cause thus , as I search for it in the past .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 18]: And why should not the individual life have its misty legends as well as that of nations ?
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 24]: From them , as from the golden and rosy clouds of morning , dawns at last the true sun of its unquestionable history .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 32]: Every boy has his own fables , just as the Romes and the Englands of the world have their Romuli and their Arthurs , their suckling wolves and their granite-sheathed swords .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: Do they not reflect each other ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 11]: I tell the tale as 't is left in me .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 17]: How long I sat thus gazing at the now self-impelled instrument , I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 25]: The next point in the progress of the legend , is a gust of wind rattling the window in whose recess I was seated .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 8]: I jumped from my chair in terror .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 30]: While I had been absorbed in the pendulum , the evening had closed in ; clouds had gathered over the sky , and all was gloomy about the house .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 22]: It was much too dark to see the distant trees , but there could be no doubt they were at work .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: The pendulum had roused them .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 16]: Another , a third , and a fourth gust rattled and shook the rickety frame .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 7]: I had done it at last !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 10]: The trees were busy away there in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: I and my pendulum could make the wind .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 18]: The gusts came faster and faster , and grew into blasts which settled into a steady gale .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 18]: The pendulum went on swinging to and fro , and the gale went on increasing in violence .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 18]: I sat half in terror , half in delight , at the awful success of my experiment .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 22]: I would have opened the window to let in the coveted air , but that was beyond my knowledge and strength .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 21]: I could make the wind blow , but , like other magicians , I could not share in its benefits .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 12]: I would go out and meet it on the open plain .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 52]: I crept down the stair like a thief -- not that I feared detention , but that I felt such a sense of the important , even the dread , about myself and my instrument , that I was not in harmony with souls reflecting only the common affairs of life .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 22]: In a moment I was in the middle of a storm -- for storm it very nearly was and soon became .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 47]: I rushed to and fro in the midst of it , lay down and rolled in it , and laughed and shouted as I looked up to the window where the pendulum was swinging , and thought of the trees at work away in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 7]: The wind grew stronger and stronger .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 33]: What if the pendulum should not stop at all , and the wind went on and on , growing louder and fiercer , till it grew mad and blew away the house ?
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 16]: Ah , then , poor grannie would have a chance of being buried at last !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: Seriously , the affair might grow serious .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 30]: Such thoughts were passing in my mind , when all at once the wind gave a roar which made me spring to my feet and rush for the house .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 6]: I must stop the pendulum .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: There was a strange sound in that blast .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 18]: The trees themselves had had enough of it , and were protesting against the creature 's tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 8]: Their master was working them too hard .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 20]: I ran up the stair on all fours : it was my way when I was in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 16]: Swinging went the pendulum in the window , and the wind roared in the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 30]: I seized hold of the oscillating thing , and stopped it ; but to my amaze and consternation , the moment I released it , on it went again .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 7]: I must sit and hold it .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 30]: But the voice of my aunt called me from below , and as I dared not explain why I would rather not appear , I was forced to obey .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 11]: I lingered on the stair , half minded to return .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 9]: ` What a rough night it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: I heard my aunt say , with rare remark .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 13]: ` It gets worse and worse , ' responded my uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 19]: I hope it wo n't disturb grannie ; but the wind must roar fearfully in her chimney . '
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 6]: I stood like a culprit .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 23]: What if they should find out that I was at the root of the mischief , at the heart of the storm !
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 40]: ` If I could believe all that I have been reading to-night about the Prince of the Power of the Air , I should not like this storm at all , ' continued my uncle , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 21]: ` But books are not always to be trusted because they are old , ' he added with another smile .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 13]: ` From the glass , I expected rain and not wind . '
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 17]: ` Whatever wind there is , we get it all , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 7]: I wonder what Willie is about .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 8]: I thought I heard him coming down .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 14]: Is n't it time , David , we did something about his schooling ?
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 16]: It wo n't do to have him idling about this way all day long . '
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 12]: ` He 's a mere child , ' returned my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 7]: ` I 'm not forgetting him .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 10]: But I ca n't send him away yet . '
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 10]: ` You know best , ' returned my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 5]: _ Send me away !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: _ What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 9]: Why should I -- where should I go ?
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 20]: Was not the old place a part of me , just like my own clothes on my own body ?
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 14]: This was the kind of feeling that woke in me at the words .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 23]: But hearing my aunt push back her chair , evidently with the purpose of finding me , I descended into the room .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: ` Come along , Willie , ' said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 9]: ` Hear the wind how it roars ! '
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 24]: ` Yes , uncle ; it does roar , ' I said , feeling a hypocrite for the first time in my life .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 17]: Knowing far more about the roaring than he did , I yet spoke like an innocent !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 12]: ` Do you know who makes the wind , Willie ? '
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 7]: The trees , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 15]: My uncle opened his blue eyes very wide , and looked at my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 12]: He had had no idea what a little heathen I was .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 45]: The more a man has wrought out his own mental condition , the readier he is to suppose that children must be able to work out theirs , and to forget that he did not work out his information , but only his conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 14]: My uncle began to think it was time to take me in hand .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: ` No , Willie , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 9]: I must teach you better than that . '
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 69]: I expected him to begin by telling me that God made the wind ; but , whether it was that what the old book said about the Prince of the Power of the Air returned upon him , or that he thought it an unfitting occasion for such a lesson when the wind was roaring so as might render its divine origin questionable , he said no more .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 20]: Bewildered , I fancy , with my ignorance , he turned , after a pause , to my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 18]: ` Do n't you think it 's time for him to go to bed , Jane ? '
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 3]: he suggested .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 41]: My aunt replied by getting from the cupboard my usual supper -- a basin of milk and a slice of bread ; which I ate with less circumspection than usual , for I was eager to return to my room .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 17]: As soon as I had finished , Nannie was called , and I bade them good-night .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 10]: ` Make haste , Nannie , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 12]: ` Do n't you hear how the wind is roaring ? '
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 18]: It was roaring louder than ever , and there was the pendulum swinging away in the window .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: Nannie took no notice of it , and , I presume , only thought I wanted to get my head under the bed-clothes , and so escape the sound of it .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 26]: Anyhow , she did make haste , and in a very few minutes I was , as she supposed , snugly settled for the night .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 18]: But the moment she shut the door I was out of bed , and at the window .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 25]: The instant I reached it , a great dash of rain swept against the panes , and the wind howled more fiercely than ever .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 65]: Believing I had the key of the position , inasmuch as , if I pleased , I could take the pendulum to bed with me , and stifle its motions with the bed-clothes -- for this happy idea had dawned upon me while Nannie was undressing me -- I was composed enough now to press my face to a pane , and look out .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 72]: There was a small space amidst the storm dimly illuminated from the windows below , and the moment I looked -- out of the darkness into this dim space , as if blown thither by the wind , rushed a figure on horseback , his large cloak flying out before him , and the mane of the animal he rode streaming out over his ears in the fierceness of the blast .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 44]: He pulled up right under my window , and I thought he looked up , and made threatening gestures at me ; but I believe now that horse and man pulled up in sudden danger of dashing against the wall of the house .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 14]: I shrank back , and when I peeped out again he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 27]: The same moment the pendulum gave a click and stopped ; one more rattle of rain against the windows , and then the wind stopped also .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 35]: I crept back to my bed in a new terror , for might not this be the Prince of the Power of the Air , come to see who was meddling with his affairs ?
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 16]: Had he not come right out of the storm , and straight from the trees ?
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 10]: He must have something to do with it all !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 17]: Before I had settled the probabilities of the question , however , I was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 21]: I awoke -- how long after , I can not tell -- with the sound of voices in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 5]: It was still dark .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 6]: The voices came from below .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 44]: I had been dreaming of the strange horseman , who had turned out to be the awful being concerning whom Nannie had enlightened me as going about at night to buy little children from their nurses , and make bagpipes of their skins .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 23]: Awaked from such a dream , it was impossible to lie still without knowing what those voices down below were talking about .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 33]: The strange one must belong to the being , whatever he was , whom I had seen come out of the storm ; and of whom could they be talking but me ?
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 7]: I was right in both conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 52]: With a fearful resolution I slipped out of bed , opened the door as noiselessly as I might , and crept on my bare , silent feet down the creaking stair , which led , with open balustrade , right into the kitchen , at the end furthest from the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 41]: The one candle at the other end could not illuminate its darkness , and I sat unseen , a few steps from the bottom of the stair , listening with all my ears , and staring with all my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 21]: The stranger 's huge cloak hung drying before the fire , and he was drinking something out of a tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 8]: The light fell full upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 14]: It was a curious , and certainly not to me an attractive face .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 19]: The forehead was very projecting , and the eyes were very small , deep set , and sparkling .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 25]: The mouth -- I had almost said muzzle -- was very projecting likewise , and the lower jaw shot in front of the upper .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 21]: When the man smiled the light was reflected from what seemed to my eyes an inordinate multitude of white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 15]: His ears were narrow and long , and set very high upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 30]: The hand which he every now and then displayed in the exigencies of his persuasion , was white , but very large , and the thumb was exceedingly long .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 42]: I had weighty reasons for both suspecting and fearing the man ; and , leaving my prejudices out of the question , there was in the conversation itself enough besides to make me take note of dangerous points in his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 43]: I never could lay much claim to physical courage , and I attribute my behaviour on this occasion rather to the fascination of terror than to any impulse of self-preservation : I sat there in utter silence , listening like an ear-trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 51]: The first words I could distinguish were to this effect : -- ` You do not mean , ' said the enemy , ` to tell me , Mr Cumbermede , that you intend to bring up the young fellow in absolute ignorance of the decrees of fate ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 28]: I pledge myself to nothing in the matter , ' returned my uncle , calmly , but with something in his tone which was new to me .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 5]: ` Good heavens ! '
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 4]: exclaimed the other .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 27]: ` Excuse me , sir , but what right can you have to interfere after such a serious fashion with the young gentleman 's future ? '
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 26]: ` It seems to me , ' said my uncle , ` that you wish to interfere with it after a much more serious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 13]: There are things in which ignorance may be preferable to knowledge . '
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 15]: ` But what harm could the knowledge of such a fact do him ? '
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 31]: ` Upset all his notions , render him incapable of thinking about anything of importance , occasion an utter -- ' But _ can _ anything be more important ? '
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 4]: interrupted the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 8]: My uncle went on without heeding him .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 37]: ` Plunge him over head and ears in -- ' ` Hot water , I grant you , ' again interrupted the enemy , to my horror ; ` but it would n't be for long .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 31]: Only give me your sanction , and I promise you to have the case as tight as a drum before I ask you to move a step in it . '
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 17]: ` But why should you take so much interest in what is purely our affair ? '
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 4]: asked my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 18]: ` Why , of course you would have to pay the piper , ' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 5]: This was too much !
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 16]: _ Pay _ the man that played upon me after I was made into bagpipes !
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 7]: The idea was too frightful . '
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 15]: I must look out for business , you know ; and , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 18]: I shall never have such a chance , if I live to the age of Methuselah . '
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 12]: ` Well , you shall not have it from me . '
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 24]: ` Then , ' said the man , rising , ` you are more of a fool than I took you for . '
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 4]: said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 11]: ` No offence ; no offence , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 19]: But it is provoking to find people so blind -- so wilfully blind -- to their own interest .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 9]: You may say I have nothing to lose .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 51]: Give me the boy , and I 'll bring him up like my own son ; send him to school and college , too -- all on the chance of being repaid twice over by -- ' I knew this was all a trick to get hold of my skin .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 35]: The man said it on his way to the door , his ape-face shining dim as he turned it a little back in the direction of my uncle , who followed with the candle .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 24]: I lost the last part of the sentence in the terror which sent me bounding up the stair in my usual four-footed fashion .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 13]: I leaped into my bed , shaking with cold and agony combined .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 31]: But I had the satisfaction presently of hearing the _ thud _ of the horse 's hoofs upon the sward , dying away in the direction whence they had come .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 7]: After that I soon fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 13]: I need hardly say that I never set the pendulum swinging again .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 38]: Many years after , I came upon it when searching for a key , and the thrill which vibrated through my whole frame announced a strange and unwelcome presence long before my memory could recall its origin .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 19]: It must not be supposed that I pretend to remember all the conversation I have just set down .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 36]: The words are but the forms in which , enlightened by facts which have since come to my knowledge , I clothe certain vague memories and impressions of such an interview as certainly took place .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 26]: In the morning , at breakfast , my aunt asked my uncle who it was that paid such an untimely visit the preceding night . '
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 23]: A fellow from Minstercombe ' -LRB- the county town -RRB- , ` an attorney -- what did he say his name was ?
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 5]: Yes , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: It was the same as the steward 's over the way .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 6]: Coningham , it was . '
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 20]: ` Mr Coningham has a son there -- an attorney too , I think , ' said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 12]: My uncle seemed struck by the reminder , and became meditative .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 12]: ` That explains his choosing such a night to come in .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 9]: His father is getting an old man now .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: Yes , it must be the same . '
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 26]: ` He 's a sharp one , folk say , ' said my aunt , with a pointedness in the remark which showed some anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 23]: ` That he can not conceal , sharp as he is , ' said my uncle , and there the conversation stopped .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 11]: The very next evening my uncle began to teach me .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 68]: I had a vague notion that this had something to do with my protection against the machinations of the man Coningham , the idea of whom was inextricably associated in my mind with that of the Prince of the Power of the Air , darting from the midst of the churning trees , on a horse whose streaming mane and flashing eyes indicated no true equine origin .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 13]: I gave myself with diligence to the work my uncle set me .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 6]: CHAPTER V. I HAVE LESSONS .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 17]: It is a simple fact that up to this time I did not know my letters .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 51]: It was , I believe , part of my uncle 's theory of education that as little pain as possible should be associated with merely intellectual effort : he would not allow me , therefore , to commence my studies until the task of learning should be an easy one .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 31]: Henceforth , every evening , after tea , he took me to his own room , the walls of which were nearly covered with books , and there taught me .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 30]: One peculiar instance of his mode I will give , and let it stand rather as a pledge for the rest of his system than an index to it .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 12]: It was only the other day it came back to me .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 35]: Like Jean Paul , he would utter the name of God to a child only at grand moments ; but there was a great difference in the moments the two men would have chosen .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 22]: Jean Paul would choose a thunder-storm , for instance ; the following will show the kind of my uncle 's choice .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 13]: One Sunday evening he took me for a longer walk than usual .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 24]: We had climbed a little hill : I believe it was the first time I ever had a wide view of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 166]: The horses were all loose in the fields ; the cattle were gathering their supper as the sun went down ; there was an indescribable hush in the air , as if Nature herself knew the seventh day ; there was no sound even of water , for here the water crept slowly to the far-off sea , and the slant sunlight shone back from just one bend of a canal-like river ; the hay-stacks and ricks of the last year gleamed golden in the farmyards ; great fields of wheat stood up stately around us , the glow in their yellow brought out by the red poppies that sheltered in the forest of their stems ; the odour of the grass and clover came in pulses ; and the soft blue sky was flecked with white clouds tinged with pink , which deepened until it gathered into a flaming rose in the west , where the sun was welling out oceans of liquid red .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 9]: I looked up in my uncle 's face .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 13]: It shone in a calm glow , like an answering rosy moon .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 35]: The eyes of my mind were opened : I saw that he felt something , and then I felt it too , His soul , with the glory for an interpreter , kindled mine .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 24]: He , in turn , caught the sight of my face , and his soul broke forth in one word : -- God !
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 5]: Willie ; God ! '
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: was all he said ; and surely it was enough .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 18]: It was only then in moments of strong repose that my uncle spoke to me of God .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 39]: Although he never petted me , that is , never showed me any animal affection , my uncle was like a father to me in this , that he was about and above me , a pure benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 34]: It is no wonder that I should learn rapidly under his teaching , for I was quick enough , and possessed the more energy that it had not been wasted on unpleasant tasks .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 22]: Whether from indifference or intent I can not tell , but he never forbade me to touch any of his books .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 30]: Upon more occasions than one he found me on the floor with a folio between my knees ; but he only smiled and said -- ` Ah , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 9]: mind you do n't crumple the leaves . '
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 24]: About this time also I had a new experience of another kind , which impressed me almost with the force of a revelation .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 17]: I had not yet explored the boundaries of the prairie-like level on which I found myself .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 19]: As soon as I got about a certain distance from home , I always turned and ran back .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 9]: Fear is sometimes the first recognition of freedom .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 24]: Delighting in liberty , I yet shrunk from the unknown spaces around me , and rushed back to the shelter of the home-walls .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 33]: But as I grew older I became more adventurous ; and one evening , although the shadows were beginning to lengthen , I went on and on until I made a discovery .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 10]: I found a half-spherical hollow in the grassy surface .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 43]: I rushed into its depth as if it had been a mine of marvels , threw myself on the ground , and gazed into the sky as if I had now for the first time discovered its true relation to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 12]: The earth was a cup , and the sky its cover .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 22]: There were lovely daisies in this hollow -- not too many to spoil the grass -- and they were red-tipped daisies .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 31]: There was besides , in the very heart of it , one plant of the finest pimpernels I have ever seen , and this was my introduction to the flower .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 10]: Nor were these all the treasures of the spot .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 23]: A late primrose , a tiny child , born out of due time , opened its timid petals in the same hollow .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 15]: Here then we regathered red-tipped daisies , large pimpernels , and one tiny primrose .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 27]: I lay and looked at them in delight -- not at all inclined to pull them , for they were where I loved to see them .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 9]: I never had much inclination to gather flowers .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 25]: I see them as a part of a whole , and rejoice in them in their own place without any desire to appropriate them .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 11]: I lay and looked at these for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 5]: Perhaps I fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 5]: I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 9]: I have often waked in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 11]: All at once I looked up and saw a vision .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 18]: My reader will please to remember that up to this hour I had never seen a lady .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 40]: I can not by any stretch call my worthy aunt a lady ; and my grandmother was too old , and too much an object of mysterious anxiety , to produce the impression , of a lady upon me .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 13]: Suddenly I became aware that a lady was looking down on me .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 25]: Over the edge of my horizon , the circle of the hollow that touched the sky , her face shone like a rising moon .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 16]: Sweet eyes looked on me , and a sweet mouth was tremulous with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 8]: I will not attempt to describe her .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 41]: To my childish eyes she was much what a descended angel must have been to eyes of old , in the days when angels did descend , and there were Arabs or Jews on the earth who could see them .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 7]: A new knowledge dawned in me .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 12]: I lay motionless , looking up with worship in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 5]: As suddenly she vanished .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 38]: I lay far into the twilight , and then rose and went home , half bewildered , with a sense of heaven about me which settled into the fancy that my mother had come to see me .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 76]: I wondered afterwards that I had not followed her ; but I never forgot her , and , morning , midday , or evening , whenever the fit seized me , I would wander away and lie down in the hollow , gazing at the spot where the lovely face had arisen , in the fancy , hardly in the hope , that my moon might once more arise and bless me with her vision .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 39]: Hence I suppose came another habit of mine , that of watching in the same hollow , and in the same posture , now for the sun , now for the moon , but generally for the sun .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 67]: You might have taken me for a fire-worshipper , so eagerly would I rise when the desire came upon me , so hastily in the clear grey of the morning would I dress myself , lest the sun should be up before me , and I fail to catch his first lance-like rays dazzling through the forest of grass on the edge of my hollow world .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 59]: Bare-footed I would scud like a hare through the dew , heedless of the sweet air of the morning , heedless of the few bird-songs about me , heedless even of the east , whose saffron might just be burning into gold , as I ran to gain the green hollow whence alone I would greet the morning .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 32]: Arrived there , I shot into its shelter , and threw myself panting on the grass , to gaze on the spot at which I expected the rising glory to appear .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: Ever when I recall the custom , that one lark is wildly praising over my head , for he sees the sun for which I am waiting .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 10]: He has his nest in the hollow beside me .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 21]: I would sooner have turned my back on the sun than disturbed the home of his high-priest , the lark .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 47]: And now the edge of my horizon begins to burn ; the green blades glow in their tops ; they are melted through with light ; the flashes invade my eyes ; they gather ; they grow , until I hide my face in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 5]: The sun is up .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 30]: But on my hands and my knees I rush after the retreating shadow , and , like a child at play with its nurse , hide in its curtain .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 32]: Up and up comes the peering sun ; he will find me ; I can not hide from him ; there is in the wide field no shelter from his gaze .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 4]: No matter then .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 22]: Let him shine into the deepest corners of my heart , and shake the cowardice and the meanness out of it .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 7]: I thus made friends with Nature .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 19]: I had no great variety even in her , but the better did I understand what I had .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 36]: The next Summer I began to hunt for glow-worms , and carry them carefully to my hollow , that in the warm , soft , moonless nights they might illumine it with a strange light .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 17]: When I had been very successful , I would call my uncle and aunt to see .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 12]: My aunt tried me by always having something to do first .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 21]: My uncle , on the other hand , would lay down his book at once , and follow me submissively .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 19]: He could not generate amusement for me , but he sympathized with what I could find for myself .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 14]: ` Come and see my cows , ' I would say to him .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 13]: I well remember the first time I took him to see them .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 13]: When we reached the hollow , he stood for a moment silent .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 17]: Then he said , laying his hand on my shoulder , ` Very pretty , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 9]: But why do you call them cows ? '
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 35]: ` You told me last night , ' I answered , ` that the road the angels go across the sky is called the milky way -- did n't you , uncle ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 14]: I never told you the angels went that way , my boy . '
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 4]: did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 6]: I thought you did . '
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 8]: ` No , I did n't . '
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 33]: I remember now : I thought if it was a way , and nobody but the angels could go in it , that must be the way the angels did go . '
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 8]: ` Yes , yes , I see !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 11]: But what has that to do with the glow-worms ? '
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 8]: ` Do n't you see , uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 14]: If it be the milky way , the stars must be the cows .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 7]: Look at my cows , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 12]: Their milk is very pretty milk , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 13]: ` Very pretty , indeed , my dear -- rather green . '
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 23]: ` Then I suppose if you could put it in auntie 's pan , you might make another moon of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 18]: ` That 's being silly now , ' said my uncle ; and I ceased , abashed .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: ` Look , look , uncle ! '
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 20]: I exclaimed , a moment after ; ` they do n't like being talked about , my cows . '
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 19]: For as if a cold gust of wind had passed over them , they all dwindled and paled .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 7]: I thought they were going out .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 8]: ` Oh dear , oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 10]: I cried , and began dancing about with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 13]: The next instant the glow returned , and the hollow was radiant .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 8]: ` Oh , the dear light ! '
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 4]: I cried again .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 7]: ` Look at it , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 6]: Is n't it lovely ? '
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 7]: He took me by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 12]: His actions were always so much more tender than his words !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 15]: ` Do you know who is the light of the world , Willie ? '
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 6]: ` Yes , well enough .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 11]: I saw him get out of bed this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 10]: My uncle led me home without a word more .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 22]: But next night he began to teach me about the light of the world , and about walking in the light .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 29]: I do not care to repeat much of what he taught me in this kind , for like my glow-worms it does not like to be talked about .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 10]: Somehow it loses colour and shine when one talks .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 15]: I have now shown sufficiently how my uncle would seize opportunities for beginning things .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 15]: He thought more of the beginning than of any other part of a process .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 13]: ` All 's well that begins well , ' he would say .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 13]: I did not know what his smile meant as he said so .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 15]: I sometimes wonder how I managed to get through the days without being weary .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 9]: No one ever thought of giving me toys .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 21]: I had a turn for using my hands ; but I was too young to be trusted with a knife .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 21]: I had never seen a kite , except far away in the sky : I took it for a bird .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 18]: There were no rushes to make water-wheels of , and no brooks to set them turning in .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 7]: I had neither top nor marbles .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 8]: I had no dog to play with .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 10]: And yet I do not remember once feeling weary .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 72]: I knew all the creatures that went creeping about in the grass , and although I did not know the proper name for one of them , I had names of my own for them all , and was so familiar with their looks and their habits , that I am confident I could in some degree interpret some of the people I met afterwards by their resemblances to these insects .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 27]: I have a man in my mind now who has exactly the head and face , if face it can be called , of an ant .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 10]: It is not a head , but a helmet .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 17]: I knew all the butterflies -- they were mostly small ones , but of lovely varieties .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 30]: A stray dragon-fly would now and then delight me ; and there were hunting-spiders and wood-lice , and queerer creatures of which I do not yet know the names .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 44]: Then there were grasshoppers , which for some time I took to be made of green leaves , and I thought they grew like fruit on the trees till they were ripe , when they jumped down , and jumped for ever after .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 22]: Another child might have caught and caged them ; for me , I followed them about , and watched their ways .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 15]: In the Winter , things had not hitherto gone quite so well with me .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: Then I had been a good deal dependent upon Nannie and her stories , which were neither very varied nor very well told .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 13]: But now that I had begun to read , things went better .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 38]: To be sure , there were not in my uncle 's library many books such as children have now-a-days ; but there were old histories , and some voyages and travels , and in them I revelled .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 29]: I am perplexed sometimes when I look into one of these books -- for I have them all about me now -- to find how dry they are .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 10]: The shine seems to have gone out of them .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 18]: Or is it that the shine has gone out of the eyes that used to read them ?
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: If so , it will come again some day .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 28]: I do not find that the shine has gone out of a beetle 's back ; and I can read _ The Pilgrim 's Progress _ still .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 3]: I COBBLE .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 42]: All this has led me , after a roundabout fashion , to what became for some time the chief delight of my Winters -- an employment , moreover , which I have taken up afresh at odd times during my life .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 5]: It came about thus .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 16]: My uncle had made me a present of an old book with pictures in it .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 14]: It was called _ The Preceptor _ -- one of Dodsley 's publications .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 11]: There were wonderful folding plates of all sorts in it .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 10]: Those which represented animals were of course my favourites .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 43]: But these especially were in a very dilapidated condition , for there had been children before me somewhere ; and I proceeded , at my uncle 's suggestion , to try to mend them by pasting them on another piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 38]: I made bad work of it at first , and was so dissatisfied with the results , that I set myself in earnest to find out by what laws of paste and paper success might be secured .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 58]: Before the Winter was over , my uncle found me grown so skilful in this manipulation of broken leaves -- for as yet I had not ventured further in any of the branches of repair -- that he gave me plenty of little jobs of the sort , for amongst his books there were many old ones .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: This was a source of great pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 62]: Before the following Winter was over , I came to try my hand at repairing bindings , and my uncle was again so much pleased with my success that one day he brought me from the county town some sheets of parchment with which to attempt the fortification of certain vellum-bound volumes which were considerably the worse for age and use .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 37]: I well remember how troublesome the parchment was for a long time ; but at last I conquered it , and succeeded very fairly in my endeavours to restore to tidiness the garments of ancient thought .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 18]: But there was another consequence of this pursuit which may be considered of weight in my history .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 46]: This was the discovery of a copy of the Countess of Pembroke 's _ Arcadia _ -- much in want of skilful patching , from the title-page , with its boar smelling at the rose-bush , to the graduated lines and the _ Finis _ .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 44]: This book I read through from boar to finis -- no small undertaking , and partly , no doubt , under its influences , I became about this time conscious of a desire after honour , as yet a notion of the vaguest .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 34]: I hardly know how I escaped the taking for granted that there were yet knights riding about on war-horses , with couched lances and fierce spurs , everywhere as in days of old .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 18]: They might have been roaming the world in all directions , without my seeing one of them .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 10]: But somehow I did not fall into the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 35]: Only with the thought of my future career , when I should be a man and go out into the world , came always the thought of the sword which hung on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: A longing to handle it began to possess me , and my old dream returned .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 16]: I dared not , however , say a word to my uncle on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 77]: I felt certain that he would slight the desire , and perhaps tell me I should hurt myself with the weapon ; and one whose heart glowed at the story of the battle between him on the white horse with carnation mane and tail , in his armour of blue radiated with gold , and him on the black-spotted brown , in his dusky armour of despair , could not expose himself to such an indignity .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 6]: THE SWORD ON THE WALL .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 22]: Where possession was impossible , knowledge might yet be reached : could I not learn the story of the ancient weapon ?
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 24]: How came that which had more fitly hung in the hall of a great castle , here upon the wall of a kitchen ?
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 19]: My uncle , however , I felt , was not the source whence I might hope for help .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 6]: No better was my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 17]: Indeed I had the conviction that she neither knew nor cared anything about the useless thing .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 14]: It was her tea-table that must be kept bright for honour 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 5]: But there was grannie !
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 10]: My relations with her had continued much the same .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 22]: The old fear of her lingered , and as yet I had had no inclination to visit her room by myself .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 54]: I saw that my uncle and aunt always behaved to her with the greatest kindness and much deference , but could not help observing also that she cherished some secret offence , receiving their ministrations with a certain condescension which clearly enough manifested its origin as hidden cause of complaint and not pride .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 55]: I wondered that my uncle and aunt took no notice of it , always addressing her as if they were on the best possible terms ; and I knew that my uncle never went to his work without visiting her , and never went to bed without reading a prayer by her bedside first .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 7]: I think Nannie told me this .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 25]: She could still read a little , for her sight had been short , and had held out better even than usual with such .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 11]: But she cared nothing for the news of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 31]: My uncle had a weekly newspaper , though not by any means regularly , from a friend in London , but I never saw it in my grandmother 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 19]: Her reading was mostly in the _ Spectator _ , or in one of De Foe 's works .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 7]: I have seen her reading Pope .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 38]: The sword was in my bones , and as I judged that only from grannie could I get any information respecting it , I found myself beginning to inquire why I was afraid to go to her .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 14]: I was unable to account for it , still less to justify it .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 42]: As I reflected , the kindness of her words and expressions dawned upon me , and I even got so far as to believe that I had been guilty of neglect in not visiting her oftener and doing something for her .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 41]: True , I recalled likewise that my uncle had desired me not to visit her except with him or my aunt , but that was ages ago , when I was a very little boy and might have been troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 12]: I could even read to her now if she wished it .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 17]: In short , I felt myself perfectly capable of entering into social relations with her generally .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 24]: But if there was any flow of affection towards her , it was the sword that had broken the seal of its fountain .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 18]: One morning at breakfast I had been sitting gazing at the sword on the wall opposite me .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 10]: My aunt had observed the steadiness of my look .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 10]: ` What are you staring at , Willie ? '
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 9]: ` Your eyes are fixed in your head .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 5]: Are you choking ? '
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 5]: The words offended me .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 10]: I got up and walked out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 29]: As I went round the table I saw that my uncle and aunt were staring at each other very much as I had been staring at the sword .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 22]: I soon felt ashamed of myself , and returned , hoping that my behaviour might be attributed to some passing indisposition .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 9]: Mechanically I raised my eyes to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 5]: Could I believe them ?
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 8]: The sword was gone -- absolutely gone !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 16]: My heart seemed to swell up into my throat ; I felt my cheeks burning .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 29]: The passion grew within me , and might have broken out in some form or other , had I not felt that would at once betray my secret .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 34]: I sat still with a fierce effort , consoling and strengthening myself with the resolution that I would hesitate no longer , but take the first chance of a private interview with grannie .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 23]: I tried hard to look as if nothing had happened , and when breakfast was over , went to my own room .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 10]: It was there I carried on my pasting operations .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 40]: There also at this time I drank deep in the ` Pilgrim 's Progress ; ' there were swords , and armour , and giants , and demons there : but I had no inclination for either employment now .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 24]: My uncle left for the farm as usual , and to my delight I soon discovered that my aunt had gone with him .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 14]: The ways of the house were as regular as those of a bee-hive .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 45]: Sitting in my own room I knew precisely where any one must be at any given moment ; for although the only clock we had was oftener standing than going , a perfect instinct of time was common to the household , Nannie included .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 15]: At that moment she was sweeping up the hearth and putting on the kettle .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 27]: In half an hour she would have tidied up the kitchen , and would have gone to prepare the vegetables for cooking : I must wait .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 27]: But the sudden fear struck me that my aunt might have taken the sword with her -- might be going to make away with it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 13]: I started up , and rushed about the room in an agony .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 5]: What could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 22]: At length I heard Nannie 's pattens clatter out of the kitchen to a small outhouse where she pared the potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 16]: I instantly descended , crossed the kitchen , and went up the winding stone stair .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 10]: I opened grannie 's door , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 8]: She was seated in her usual place .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 11]: Never till now had I felt how old she was .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 22]: She looked up when I entered , for although she had grown very deaf , she could feel the floor shake .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 24]: I saw by her eyes , which looked higher than my head , that she had expected a taller figure to follow me .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 40]: When I turned from shutting the door , I saw her arms extended with an eager look , and could see her hands trembling ere she folded them about me , and pressed my head to her bosom . '
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 4]: O Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 8]: she said , ' I thank thee .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 8]: I will try to be good now .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: O Lord , I have waited , and thou hast heard me .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 8]: I will believe in thee again ! '
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 20]: From that moment I loved my grannie , and felt I owed her something as well as my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 10]: I had never had this feeling about my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 4]: ` Grannie ! '
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 24]: I said , trembling from a conflict of emotions ; but before I could utter my complaint , I had burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: ` What have they been doing to you , child ? '
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 14]: she asked , almost fiercely , and sat up straight in her chair .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 13]: Her voice , although feeble and quavering , was determined in tone .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 16]: She pushed me back from her and sought the face I was ashamed to show .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 12]: ` What have they done to you , my boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 13]: she repeated , ere I could conquer my sobs sufficiently to speak .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 15]: ` They have taken away the sword that -- ' ` What sword ? '
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 4]: she asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 16]: ` Not the sword that your great-grandfather wore when he followed Sir Marmaduke ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 8]: I do n't know , grannie . '
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 7]: ` Do n't know , boy ?
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 10]: The only thing your father took when he -- .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 8]: Not the sword with the broken sheath ?
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 6]: They dare n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 6]: I will go down myself .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 9]: I must see about it at once . '
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 9]: ` Oh , grannie , do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 12]: I cried in terror , as she rose from her chair .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 17]: ` They 'll not let me ever come near you again , if you do . '
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 5]: She sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 32]: After seeming to ponder for a while in silence , she said : -- ` Well , Willie , my dear , you 're more to me than the old sword .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 18]: But I would n't have had it handled with disrespect for all that the place is worth .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 10]: However , I do n't suppose they can -- .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 8]: What made them do it , child ?
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 11]: They 've not taken it down from the wall ? '
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 5]: ` Yes , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 15]: I think it was because I was staring at it too much , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 15]: Perhaps they were afraid I would take it down and hurt myself with it .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 11]: But I was only going to ask you about it .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 10]: Tell me a story about it , grannie . '
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 23]: All my notion was some story , I did not think whether true or false , like one of Nannie 's stories .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 16]: ` That I will , my child -- all about it -- all about it .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 5]: Let me see . '
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 12]: Her eyes went wandering a little , and she looked perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 11]: ` And they took it from you , did they ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 3]: Poor child !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 4]: Poor child ! '
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 11]: ` They did n't take it from me , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 9]: I never had it in my hands . '
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 8]: ` Would n't give it you then ?
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 4]: Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 13]: I began to feel uncomfortable -- grannie looked so strange and lost .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 42]: The old feeling that she ought to be buried because she was dead returned upon me ; but I overcame it so far as to be able to say : ` Wo n't you tell me about it then , grannie ?
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 11]: I want so much to hear about the battle . '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 6]: ` What battle , child ?
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 3]: Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 24]: I 'll tell you all about it some day , but I 've forgot now , I 've forgot it all now . '
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 21]: She pressed her hand to her forehead , and sat thus for some time , while I grew very frightened .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 27]: I would gladly have left the room and crept down-stairs , but I stood fascinated , gazing at the withered face half-hidden by the withered hand .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 20]: I longed to be anywhere else , but my will had deserted me , and there I must remain .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 16]: At length grannie took her hand from her eyes , and seeing me , started .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 7]: ` Ah , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 9]: she said , ' I had forgotten you .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 15]: You wanted me to do something for you : what was it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 13]: I wanted you to tell me about the sword , grannie . '
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: ` Oh yes , the sword ! '
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 11]: she returned , putting her hand again to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 11]: ` They took it away from you , did they ?
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 5]: Well , never mind .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 21]: I will give you something else -- though I do n't say it 's as good as the sword . '
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 25]: She rose , and taking an ivory-headed stick which leaned against the side of the chimney-piece , walked with tottering steps towards the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 55]: There she took from her pocket a small bunch of keys , and having , with some difficulty from the trembling of her hands , chosen one and unlocked the sloping cover , she opened a little drawer inside , and took out a gold watch with a bunch of seals hanging from it .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 12]: Never shall I forget the thrill that went through my frame .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 13]: Did she mean to let me hold it in my own hand ?
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 13]: Might I have it as often as I came to see her ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 28]: Imagine my ecstasy when she put it carefully in the two hands I held up to receive it , and said : ` There , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 18]: You must take good care of it , and never give it away for love or money .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 21]: Do n't you open it -- there 's a good boy , till you 're a man like your father .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 7]: He _ was _ a man !
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 24]: He gave it to me the day we were married , for he had nothing else , he said , to offer me .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 10]: But I would not take it , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 13]: I liked better to see him with it than have it myself .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 12]: And when he left me , I kept it for you .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 12]: But you must take care of it , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 9]: ` Oh , thank you , grannie ! '
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 10]: I cried , in an agony of pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 13]: I _ will _ take care of it -- indeed I will .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 15]: Is it a real watch , grannie -- as real as uncle 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 13]: ` It 's worth ten of your uncle 's , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 9]: Do n't you show it him , though .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 7]: He might take that away too .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 22]: Your uncle 's a very good man , my dear , but you must n't mind everything he says to you .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 4]: He forgets things .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 5]: I never forget anything .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: I have plenty of time to think about things .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: I never forget . '
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 8]: ` Will it go , grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 16]: I asked , for my uncle was a much less interesting subject than the watch .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 16]: ` It wo n't go without being wound up ; but you might break it .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 7]: Besides , it may want cleaning .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 10]: It 's several years since it was cleaned last .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 8]: Where will you put it now ? '
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 15]: I know where to hide it safe enough , grannie , ' I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 8]: ` I 'll take care of it .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 9]: You need n't be afraid , grannie . '
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 13]: The old lady turned , and with difficulty tottered to her seat .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 13]: I remained where I was , fixed in contemplation of my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 4]: She called me .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 8]: I went and stood by her knee .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 39]: ` My child , there is something I want very much to tell you , but you know old people forget things -- ' ` But you said just now that you never forgot anything , grannie . '
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 26]: ` No more I do , my dear ; only I ca n't always lay my hands upon a thing when I want it . '
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 19]: ` It was about the sword , grannie , ' I said , thinking to refresh her memory .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 26]: ` No , my dear ; I do n't think it was about the sword exactly -- though that had something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 7]: I shall remember it all by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: It will come again .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 8]: And so must you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 10]: Do n't leave your old mother so long alone .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 10]: It 's weary , weary work , waiting . '
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 13]: ` Indeed I wo n't , grannie , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 10]: I will come the very first time I can .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 12]: Only I must n't let auntie see me , you know .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 16]: -- You do n't want to be buried now , do you , grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 33]: I added ; for I had begun to love her , and the love had cast out the fear , and I did not want her to wish to be buried . '
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 16]: I am very , very old ; much too old to live , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 14]: But I must do you justice before I can go to my grave .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 11]: _ Now _ I know what I wanted to say .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 5]: It 's gone again .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 44]: If I had you in the middle of the night , when everything comes back as if it had been only yesterday , I could tell you all about it from beginning to end , with all the ins and outs of it .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 12]: But I ca n't now -- I ca n't now . '
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 9]: She moaned and rocked herself to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 40]: ` Never mind , grannie , ' I said cheerfully , for I was happy enough for all eternity with my gold watch ; ' I will come and see you again as soon as ever I can . '
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: And I kissed her on the white cheek .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 7]: ` Thank you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 8]: I think you had better go now .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 22]: They may miss you , and then I should never see you again -- to talk to , I mean . '
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 16]: ` Why wo n't they let me come , and see you , grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 32]: ` That 's what I wanted to tell you , if I could only see a little better , ' she answered , once more putting her hand to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 12]: ` Perhaps I shall be able to tell you next time .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 7]: Go now , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: I left the room , nothing loth , for I longed to be alone with my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 13]: I could not get enough of it in grannie 's presence even .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: Noiseless as a bat I crept down the stair .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 13]: When I reached the door at the foot I stood and listened .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 6]: The kitchen was quite silent .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 4]: I stepped out .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 6]: There was no one there .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 20]: I scudded across and up the other stair to my own room , carefully shutting the door behind me .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 43]: Then I sat down on the floor on the other side of the bed , so that it was between me and the door , and I could run into the closet with my treasure before any one entering should see me .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 9]: The watch was a very thick round one .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 19]: The back of it was crowded with raised figures in the kind of work called _ repoussée _ .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 16]: I pored over these for a long time , and then turned to the face .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 19]: It was set all round with shining stones -- diamonds , though I knew nothing of diamonds then .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 19]: The enamel was cracked , and I followed every crack as well as every figure of the hours .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 13]: Then I began to wonder what I could do with it next .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 5]: I was not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 14]: Possession I found was not bliss : it had not rendered me content .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 14]: But it was as yet imperfect : I had not seen the inside .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 46]: Grannie had told me not to open it : I began to think it hard that I should be denied thorough possession of what had been given to me , I believed I should be quite satisfied if I once saw what made it go .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 18]: I turned it over and over , thinking I might at least find how it was opened .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 20]: I have little doubt if I had discovered the secret of it , my virtue would have failed me .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 19]: All I did find , however , was the head of a curious animal engraved on the handle .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 4]: This was something .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 30]: I examined it as carefully as the rest , and then finding I had for the time exhausted the pleasures of the watch , I turned to the seals .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 18]: On one of them was engraved what looked like letters , but I could not read them .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 12]: I did not know that they were turned the wrong way .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 40]: One of them was like a W. On the other seal -- there were but two and a curiously-contrived key -- I found the same head as was engraved on the handle -- turned the other way of course .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 29]: Wearied at length , I took the precious thing into the dark closet , and laid it in a little box which formed one of my few possessions .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 43]: I then wandered out into the field , and went straying about until dinner-time , during which I believe I never once lifted my eyes to the place where the sword had hung , lest even that action should betray the watch .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 22]: From that day my head , and as much of my heart as might be , were filled with the watch .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 4]: And , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 25]: I soon found that my bookmending had grown distasteful to me , and for the satisfaction of employment , possession was a poor substitute .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 44]: As often as I made the attempt to resume it , I got weary , and wandered almost involuntarily to the closet to feel for my treasure in the dark , handle it once more , and bring it out into the light .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 23]: Already I began to dree the doom of riches , in the vain attempt to live by that which was not bread .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: Nor was this all .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 16]: A certain weight began to gather over my spirit -- a sense almost of wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 69]: For although the watch had been given me by my grandmother , and I never doubted either her right to dispose of it or my right to possess it , I could not look my uncle in the face , partly from a vague fear lest he should read my secret in my eyes , partly from a sense of something out of joint between him and me .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 30]: I began to fancy , and I believe I was right , that he looked at me sometimes with a wistfulness I had never seen in his face before .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 17]: This made me so uncomfortable that I began to avoid his presence as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 19]: And although I tried to please him with my lessons , I could not learn them as hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 15]: One day he asked me to bring him the book I had been repairing .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 13]: ` It 's not finished yet , uncle , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 11]: ` Will you bring it me just as it is .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: I want to look for something in it . '
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 8]: I went and brought it with shame .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 30]: He took it , and having found the passage he wanted , turned the volume once over in his hands , and gave it me back without a word .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 11]: Next day I restored it to him finished and tidy .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 16]: He thanked me , looked it over again , and put it in its place .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 11]: But I fairly encountered an inquiring and somewhat anxious gaze .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 14]: I believe he had a talk with my aunt about me that night .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 37]: The next morning , I was seated by the bedside , with my secret in my hand , when I thought I heard the sound of the door-handle , and glided at once into the closet .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 16]: When I came out in a flutter of anxiety , there was no one there .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 21]: But I had been too much startled to return to what I had grown to feel almost a guilty pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 53]: The next morning after breakfast , I crept into the closet , put my hand unerringly into the one corner of the box , found no watch , and after an unavailing search , sat down in the dark on a bundle of rags , with the sensations of a ruined man .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 8]: My world was withered up and gone .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 10]: How the day passed , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 13]: How I got through my meals , I can not even imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 29]: When I look back and attempt to recall the time , I see but a cloudy waste of misery crossed by the lightning-streaks of a sense of injury .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 19]: All that was left me now was a cat-like watching for the chance of going to my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 12]: Into her ear I would pour the tale of my wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 19]: She who had been as a haunting discomfort to me , had grown to be my one consolation .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 7]: My lessons went on as usual .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 27]: A certain pride enabled me to learn them tolerably for a day or two ; but when that faded , my whole being began to flag .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 13]: For some time my existence was a kind of life in death .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 35]: At length one evening my uncle said to me , as we finished my lessons far from satisfactorily -- ` Willie , your aunt and I think it better you should go to school .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 16]: We shall be very sorry to part with you , but it will be better .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 10]: You will then have companions of your own age .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 11]: You have not enough to amuse you at home . '
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 15]: He did not allude by a single word to the affair of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 12]: Could my aunt have taken it , and never told him ?
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 5]: It was not likely .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 19]: I was delighted at the idea of any change , for my life had grown irksome to me .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 9]: ` Oh , thank you , uncle ! '
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 7]: I cried , with genuine expression .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 14]: I think he looked a little sad ; but he uttered no reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 9]: My aunt and he had already arranged everything .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 25]: The next day but one , I saw , for the first time , a carriage drive up to the door of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 7]: I was waiting for it impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 12]: My new clothes had all been packed in a little box .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 17]: I had not put in a single toy : I cared for nothing I had now .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 9]: The box was put up beside the driver .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 14]: My aunt came to the door where I was waiting for my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 12]: ` May n't I go and say good-bye to grannie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 14]: ` She 's not very well to-day , ' said my aunt . '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 7]: I think you had better not .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 11]: You will be back at Christmas , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 13]: I was not so much grieved as I ought to have been .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 14]: The loss of my watch had made the thought of grannie painful again .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 20]: ` Your uncle will meet you at the road , ' continued my aunt , seeing me still hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: ` Good-bye . '
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 44]: I received her cold embrace without emotion , clambered into the chaise , and looking out as the driver shut the door , wondered what my aunt was holding her apron to her eyes for , as she turned away into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 52]: My uncle met us and got in , and away the chaise rattled , bearing me towards an utterly new experience ; for hardly could the strangest region in foreign lands be more unknown to the wandering mariner than the faces and ways of even my own kind were to me .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 12]: I had never played for one half-hour with boy or girl .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 10]: I knew nothing of their play-things or their games .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 60]: I hardly knew what boys were like , except , outwardly , from the dim reflex of myself in the broken mirror in my bed-room , whose lustre was more of the ice than the pool , and , inwardly , from the partly exceptional experiences of my own nature , with which even I was poorly enough acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 10]: I GO TO SCHOOL , AND GRANNIE LEAVES IT .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 18]: It is an evil thing to break up a family before the natural period of its dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 35]: In the course of things , marriage , the necessities of maintenance , or the energies of labour guiding ` to fresh woods and pastures new , ' are the ordered causes of separation .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 51]: Where the home is happy , much injury is done the children in sending them to school , except it be a day-school , whither they go in the morning as to the labours of the world , but whence they return at night as to the heaven of repose .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 13]: Conflict through the day , rest at night , is the ideal .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 40]: A day-school will suffice for the cultivation of the necessary public or national spirit , without which the love of the family may degenerate into a merely extended selfishness , but which is itself founded upon those family affections .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 30]: At the same time , it must be confessed that boarding-schools are , in many cases , an antidote to some of the evil conditions which exist at home .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 18]: To children whose home is a happy one , the exile to a school must be bitter .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 9]: Mine , however , was an unusual experience .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 33]: Leaving aside the specially troubled state in which I was when thus carried to the village of Aldwick , I had few of the finer elements of the ideal home in mine .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: The love of my childish heart had never been drawn out .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 16]: My grandmother had begun to do so , but her influence had been speedily arrested .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 41]: I was , as they say of cats , more attached to the place than the people , and no regrets whatever interfered to quell the excitement of expectation , wonder , and curiosity which filled me on the journey .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 37]: The motion of the vehicle , the sound of the horses ' hoofs , the travellers we passed on the road -- all seemed to partake of the exuberant life which swelled and overflowed in me .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 12]: Everything was as happy , as excited , as I was .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 15]: When we entered the village , behold it was a region of glad tumult !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 42]: Were there not three dogs , two carts , a maid carrying pails of water , and several groups of frolicking children in the street -- not to mention live ducks , and a glimpse of grazing geese on the common ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 17]: There were also two mothers at their cottage-doors , each with a baby in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 15]: I knew they were babies , although I had never seen a baby before .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 47]: And when we drove through the big wooden gate , and stopped at the door of what had been the manor-house but was now Mr Elder 's school , the aspect of the building , half-covered with ivy , bore to me a most friendly look .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 31]: Still more friendly was the face of the master 's wife , who received us in a low dark parlour , with a thick soft carpet and rich red curtains .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 9]: It was a perfect paradise to my imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 17]: Nor did the appearance of Mr Elder at all jar with the vision of coming happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 36]: His round , rosy , spectacled face bore in it no premonitory suggestion of birch or rod , and although I continued at his school for six years , I never saw him use either .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 14]: If a boy required that kind of treatment , he sent him home .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 16]: When my uncle left me , it was in more than contentment with my lot .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 13]: Nor did anything occur to alter my feeling with regard to it .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 9]: I soon became much attached to Mrs Elder .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 23]: She was just the woman for a schoolmaster 's wife -- as full of maternity as she could hold , but childless .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 18]: By the end of the first day I thought I loved her far more than my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 18]: My aunt had done her duty towards me ; but how was a child to weigh that ?
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 33]: She had taken no trouble to make me love her ; she had shown me none of the signs of affection , and I could not appreciate the proofs of it yet .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 19]: I soon perceived a great difference between my uncle 's way of teaching and that of Mr Elder .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 23]: My uncle always appeared aware of something behind which pressed upon , perhaps hurried , the fact he was making me understand .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 19]: He made me feel , perhaps too much , that it was a mere step towards something beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 25]: Mr Elder , on the other hand , placed every point in such a strong light that it seemed in itself of primary consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 28]: Both were , if my judgment after so many years be correct , admirable teachers -- my uncle the greater , my school-master the more immediately efficient .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 21]: As I was a manageable boy to the very verge of weakness , the relations between us were entirely pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 23]: There were only six more pupils , all of them sufficiently older than myself to be ready to pet and indulge me .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 47]: No one who saw me mounted on the back of the eldest , a lad of fifteen , and driving four of them in hand , while the sixth ran alongside as an outrider -- could have wondered that I should find school better than home .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 19]: Before the first day was over , the sorrows of the lost watch and sword had vanished utterly .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 8]: For what was possession to being possessed ?
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 17]: What was a watch , even had it been going , to the movements of life ?
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 50]: To peep from the wicket in the great gate out upon the village street , with the well in the middle of it , and a girl in the sunshine winding up the green dripping bucket from the unknown depths of coolness , was more than a thousand watches .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 15]: But this was by no means the extent of my new survey of things .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 39]: One of the causes of Mr Elder 's keeping no boy who required chastisement was his own love of freedom , and his consequent desire to give the boys as much liberty out of school hours as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 5]: He believed in freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 52]: ` The great end of training , ' he said to me many years after , when he was quite an old man , ` is liberty ; and the sooner you can get a boy to be a law to himself , the sooner you make a man of him .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 7]: This end is impossible without freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 38]: Let those who have no choice , or who have not the same end in view , do the best they can with such boys as they find : I chose only such as could bear liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 13]: I never set up as a reformer -- only as an educator .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 12]: For that kind of work others were more fit than I .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 7]: It was not my calling . '
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 19]: Hence Mr Elder no more allowed labour to intrude upon play , than play to intrude upon labour .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 39]: As soon as lessons were over , we were free to go where we would and do what we would , under certain general restrictions , which had more to do with social proprieties than with school regulations .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 17]: We roamed the country from tea-time till sun-down ; sometimes in the Summer long after that .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 31]: Sometimes also on moonlit nights in Winter , occasionally even when the stars and the snow gave the only light , we were allowed the same liberty until nearly bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 34]: Before Christmas came , variety , exercise , and social blessedness had wrought upon me so that when I returned home , my uncle and aunt were astonished at the change in me .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 30]: I had grown half a head , and the paleness , which they had considered a peculiar accident of my appearance , had given place to a rosy glow .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 33]: My flitting step too had vanished : I soon became aware that I made more noise than my aunt liked , for in the old house silence was in its very temple .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 26]: My uncle , however , would only smile and say -- ` Do n't bring the place about our ears , Willie , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 10]: I should like it to last my time . '
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 25]: ` I 'm afraid , ' my aunt would interpose , ` Mr Elder does n't keep very good order in his school . '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 25]: Then I would fire up in defence of the master , and my uncle would sit and listen , looking both pleased and amused .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 27]: I had not been many moments in the house before I said -- ` May n't I run up and see grannie , uncle ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 16]: I will go and see how she is , ' my aunt said , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 15]: She went , and presently returning , said ` Grannie seems a little better .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 4]: You may come .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 7]: She wants to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 4]: I followed her .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 19]: When I entered the room and looked expectantly towards her usual place , I found her chair empty .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 6]: I turned to the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 27]: There she was , and I thought she looked much the same ; but when I came nearer , I perceived a change in her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 20]: She welcomed me feebly , stroked my hair and my cheeks , smiled sweetly , and closed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 6]: My aunt led me away .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 17]: When bedtime came , I went to my own room , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 27]: What roused me I do not know , but I awoke in the midst of the darkness , and the next moment I heard a groan .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 6]: It thrilled me with horror .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 13]: I sat up in bed and listened , but heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 33]: As I sat listening , heedless of the cold , the explanation dawned upon me , for my powers of reflection and combination had been developed by my enlarged experience of life .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 25]: In our many wanderings , I had learned to choose between roads and to make conjectures from the _ lie _ of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 13]: I had likewise lived in a far larger house than my home .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 38]: Hence it now dawned upon me , for the first time , that grannie 's room must be next to mine , although approached from the other side , and that the groan must have been hers .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 8]: She might be in need of help .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 39]: I remembered at the same time how she had wished to have me by her in the middle of the night , that she might be able to tell me what she could not recall in the day .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 25]: I got up at once , dressed myself , and stole down the one stair , across the kitchen , and up the other .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: I gently opened grannie 's door and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 8]: A fire was burning in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 7]: I entered and approached the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 20]: I wondered how I had the courage ; but children more than grown people are moved by unlikely impulses .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: Grannie lay breathing heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 6]: I stood for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 9]: The faint light flickered over her white face .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 21]: It was the middle of the night , and the tide of fear inseparable from the night began to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 11]: My old fear of her began to return with it .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 12]: But she lifted her lids , and the terror ebbed away .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 13]: She looked at me , but did not seem to know me .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 4]: I went nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 33]: ` Grannie , ' I said , close to her ear , and speaking low ; ` you wanted to see me at night -- that was before I went to school .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 7]: I 'm here , grannie . '
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 23]: The sheet was folded back so smooth that she could hardly have turned over since it had been arranged for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 7]: Her hand was lying upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 11]: She lifted it feebly and stroked my cheek once more .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 21]: Her lips murmured something which I could not hear , and then came a deep sigh , almost a groan .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 13]: The terror returned when I found she could not speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 9]: ` Shall I go and fetch auntie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 3]: I whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 12]: She shook her head feebly , and looked wistfully at me .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 5]: Her lips moved again .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 11]: I guessed that she wanted me to sit beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 15]: I got a chair , placed it by the bedside , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 12]: She put out her hand , as if searching for something .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 6]: I laid mine in it .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 10]: She closed her fingers upon it and seemed satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 12]: When I looked again , she was asleep and breathing quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 15]: I was afraid to take my hand from hers lest I should wake her .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 18]: I laid my head on the side of the bed , and was soon fast asleep also .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 10]: I was awaked by a noise in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 7]: It was Nannie laying the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 11]: When she saw me she gave a cry of terror .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 6]: ` Hush , Nannie ! '
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 25]: I said ; ` you will wake grannie : ' and as I spoke I rose , for I found my hand was free .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 7]: ` Oh , Master Willie ! '
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 15]: said Nannie , in a low voice ; ` how did you come here ?
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 9]: You sent my heart into my mouth . '
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 18]: ` Swallow it again , Nannie , ' I answered , ` and do n't tell auntie .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 10]: I came to see grannie , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 5]: I 'm rather cold .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 7]: I 'll go to bed now .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 8]: Auntie 's not up , is she ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 12]: It 's not time for anybody to be up yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 42]: Nannie ought to have spent the night in grannie 's room , for it was her turn to watch ; but finding her nicely asleep as she thought , she had slipped away for just an hour of comfort in bed .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 7]: The hour had grown to three .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 8]: When she returned the fire was out .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 21]: When I came down to breakfast the solemn look upon my uncle 's face caused me a foreboding of change .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 25]: ` God has taken grannie away in the night , Willie , ' said he , holding the hand I had placed in his .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 6]: ` Is she dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 20]: ` Oh , then , you will let her go to her grave now , wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 29]: I said -- the recollection of her old grievance coming first in association with her death , and occasioning a more childish speech than belonged to my years .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 25]: She 'll get to her grave now , ' said my aunt , with a trembling in her voice I had never heard before .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 8]: ` No , ' objected my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 18]: ` Her body will go to the grave , but her soul will go to heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 5]: ` Her soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 6]: ` Dear me , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 7]: do n't you know that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 4]: said my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: ` Do n't you know you 've got a soul as well as a body ? '
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 14]: ` I 'm sure _ I _ have n't , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 8]: ` What was grannie 's like ? '
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 12]: ` That I ca n't tell you , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: ` Have you got one , auntie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: ` What is yours like then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 6]: I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 44]: ` But , ' I said , turning to my uncle , ` if her body goes to the grave , and her soul to heaven , what 's to become of poor grannie -- without either of them , you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: My uncle had been thinking while we talked .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 19]: ` That ca n't be the way to represent the thing , Jane ; it puzzles the child .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 20]: No , Willie ; grannie 's body goes to the grave , but grannie herself is gone to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 11]: What people call her soul is just grannie herself . '
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 11]: ` Why do n't they say so , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 6]: My uncle fell a-thinking again .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 45]: He did not , however , answer this last question , for I suspect he found that it would not be good for me to know the real cause -- namely , that people hardly believed it , and therefore did not say it .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 13]: Most people believe far more in their bodies than in their souls .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 12]: What my uncle did say was -- ' I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 9]: But grannie 's gone to heaven anyhow . '
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 7]: ` I 'm so glad ! '
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 8]: ` She will be more comfortable there .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: She was too old , you know , uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 5]: He made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 29]: My aunt 's apron was covering her face , and when she took it away , I observed that those eager almost angry eyes were red with weeping .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 22]: I began to feel a movement at my heart , the first fluttering physical sign of a waking love towards her .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 12]: ` Do n't cry , auntie , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: I do n't see anything to cry about .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 8]: Grannie has got what she wanted . '
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 14]: She made me no answer , and I sat down to my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 15]: I do n't know how it was , but I could not eat it .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 13]: I rose and took my way to the hollow in the field .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 9]: I felt a strange excitement , not sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: Grannie was actually dead at last .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: I did not quite know what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 8]: I had never seen a dead body .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 17]: Neither did I know that she had died while I slept with my hand in hers .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 24]: Nannie , seeing something peculiar , had gone to her the moment I left the room , and had found her quite cold .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 36]: Had we been a talking family , I might have been uneasy until I had told the story of my last interview with her ; but I never thought of saying a word about it .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 36]: I can not help thinking now that I was waked up and sent to the old woman , my great-grandmother , in the middle of the night , to help her to die in comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 3]: Who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 20]: What we can neither prove nor comprehend forms , I suspect , the infinitely larger part of our being .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 27]: When I was taken to see what remained of grannie , I experienced nothing of the dismay which some children feel at the sight of death .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 30]: It was as if she had seen something just in time to leave the look of it behind her there , and so the final expression was a revelation .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 19]: For a while there seems to remain this one link between some dead bodies and their living spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 16]: But my aunt , with a common superstition , would have me touch the face .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 20]: That , I confess , made me shudder : the cold of death is so unlike any other cold !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 15]: I seemed to feel it in my hand all the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 57]: I saw what seemed grannie -- I am too near death myself to consent to call a dead body the man or the woman -- laid in the grave for which she had longed , and returned home with a sense that somehow there was a barrier broken down between me and my uncle and aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 13]: I felt as near my uncle now as I had ever been .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 22]: That evening he did not go to his own room , but sat with my aunt and me in the kitchen-hall .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 25]: We pulled the great high-backed oaken settle before the fire , and my aunt made a great blaze , for it was very cold .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 22]: They sat one in each corner , and I sat between them , and told them many things concerning the school .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 20]: They asked me questions and encouraged my prattle , seeming well pleased that the old silence should be broken .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 14]: I fancy I brought them a little nearer to each other that night .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 20]: It was after a funeral , and yet they both looked happier than I had ever seen them before .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 5]: I SIN AND REPENT .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 12]: The Christmas holidays went by more rapidly than I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 23]: I betook myself with enlarged faculty to my book-mending , and more than ever enjoyed making my uncle 's old volumes tidy .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 29]: When I returned to school , it was with real sorrow at parting from my uncle ; and even towards my aunt I now felt a growing attraction .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 9]: I shall not dwell upon my school history .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 10]: That would be to spin out my narrative unnecessarily .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 22]: I shall only relate such occurrences as are guide-posts in the direction of those main events which properly constitute my history .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 10]: I had been about two years with Mr Elder .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 49]: The usual holidays had intervened , upon which occasions I found the pleasures of home so multiplied by increase of liberty and the enlarged confidence of my uncle , who took me about with him everywhere , that they were now almost capable of rivalling those of school .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 26]: But before I relate an incident which occurred in the second Autumn , I must say a few words about my character at this time .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 19]: My reader will please to remember that I had never been driven , or oppressed in any way .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 32]: The affair of the watch was quite an isolated instance , and so immediately followed by the change and fresh life of school that it had not left a mark behind .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 16]: Nothing had yet occurred to generate in me any fear before the face of man .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 21]: I had been vaguely uneasy in relation to my grandmother , but that uneasiness had almost vanished before her death .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 11]: Hence the faith natural to childhood had received no check .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 21]: My aunt was at worst cold ; she had never been harsh ; while over Nannie I was absolute ruler .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 19]: The only time that evil had threatened me , I had been faithfully defended by my guardian uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 20]: At school , while I found myself more under law , I yet found myself possessed of greater freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 9]: Every one was friendly and more than kind .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 13]: From all this the result was that my nature was unusually trusting .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 17]: We had a whole holiday , and , all seven , set out to enjoy ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 25]: It was a delicious morning in Autumn , clear and cool , with a great light in the east , and the west nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 23]: Neither the autumnal tints nor the sharpening wind had any sadness in those young years which we call the old years afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 28]: How strange it seems to have -- all of us -- to say with the Jewish poet : I have been young , and now am old !
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 24]: A wood in the distance , rising up the slope of a hill , was our goal , for we were after hazel-nuts .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 17]: Frolicking , scampering , leaping over stiles , we felt the road vanish under our feet .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 22]: When we gained the wood , although we failed in our quest we found plenty of amusement ; that grew everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 24]: At length it was time to return , and we resolved on going home by another road -- one we did not know .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 22]: After walking a good distance , we arrived at a gate and lodge , where we stopped to inquire the way .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 32]: A kind-faced woman informed us that we should shorten it much by going through the park , which , as we seemed respectable boys , she would allow us to do .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 45]: We thanked her , entered , and went walking along a smooth road , through open sward , clumps of trees and an occasional piece of artful neglect in the shape of rough hillocks covered with wild shrubs , such as brier and broom .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 11]: It was very delightful , and we walked along merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 47]: I can yet recall the individual shapes of certain hawthorn trees we passed , whose extreme age had found expression in a wild grotesqueness which would have been ridiculous but for a dim , painful resemblance to the distortion of old age in the human family .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 27]: After walking some distance , we began to doubt whether we might not have missed the way to the gate of which the woman had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 37]: For a wall appeared , which , to judge from the tree-tops visible over it , must surround a kitchen garden or orchard ; and from this we feared we had come too nigh the house .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 44]: We had not gone much further before a branch , projecting over the wall , from whose tip , as if the tempter had gone back to his old tricks , hung a rosy-cheeked apple , drew our eyes and arrested our steps .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 65]: There are grown people who can not , without an effort of the imagination , figure to themselves the attraction between a boy and an apple ; but I suspect there are others the memories of whose boyish freaks will render it yet more difficult for them to understand a single moment 's contemplation of such an object without the endeavour to appropriate it .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 17]: To them the boy seems made for the apple , and the apple for the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 64]: Rosy , round-faced , spectacled Mr Elder , however , had such a fine sense of honour in himself that he had been to a rare degree successful in developing a similar sense in his boys , and I do believe that not one of us would , under any circumstances , except possibly those of terrifying compulsion , have pulled that apple .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 15]: We stood in rapt contemplation for a few moments , and then walked away .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 27]: But although there are no degrees in Virtue , who will still demand her uttermost farthing , there are degrees in the virtuousness of human beings .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 27]: As we walked away , I was the last , and was just passing from under the branch when something struck the ground at my heel .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 3]: I turned .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 17]: An apple must fall some time , and for this apple that some time was then .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: It lay at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 16]: I lifted it and stood gazing at it -- I need not say with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 5]: My mind fell a-working .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 10]: The adversary was there , and the angel too .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: The apple had dropped at my feet ; I had not pulled it .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 30]: There it would lie wasting , if some one with less right than I -- said the prince of special pleaders -- was not the second to find it .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 11]: Besides , what fell in the road was public property .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 13]: Only this was not a public road , the angel reminded me .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 25]: My will fluttered from side to side , now turning its ear to my conscience , now turning away and hearkening to my impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 32]: At last , weary of the strife , I determined to settle it by a just contempt of trifles -- and , half in desperation , bit into the ruddy cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 25]: The moment I saw the wound my teeth had made , I knew what I had done , and my heart died within me .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 4]: I was self-condemned .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 20]: It was a new and an awful sensation -- a sensation that could not be for a moment endured .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 12]: The misery was too intense to leave room for repentance even .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 24]: With a sudden resolve born of despair , I shoved the type of the broken law into my pocket and followed my companions .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 22]: But I kept at some distance behind them , for as yet I dared not hold further communication with respectable people .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 25]: I did not , and do not now , believe that there was one amongst them who would have done as I had done .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 18]: Probably also not one of them would have thought of my way of deliverance from unendurable self-contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 15]: The curse had passed upon me , but I saw a way of escape .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 15]: A few yards further , they found the road we thought we had missed .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 16]: It struck off into a hollow , the sides of which were covered with trees .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 15]: As they turned into it they looked back and called me to come on .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 39]: I ran as if I wanted to overtake them , but the moment they were out of sight , left the road for the grass , and set off at full speed in the same direction as before .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 32]: I had not gone far before I was in the midst of trees , overflowing the hollow in which my companions had disappeared , and spreading themselves over the level above .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 29]: As I entered their shadow , my old awe of the trees returned upon me -- an awe I had nearly forgotten , but revived by my crime .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 19]: I pressed along , however , for to turn back would have been more dreadful than any fear .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 23]: At length , with a sudden turn , the road left the trees behind , and what a scene opened before me !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 25]: I stood on the verge of a large space of greensward , smooth and well-kept as a lawn , but somewhat irregular in surface .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 9]: From all sides it rose towards the centre .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 28]: There a broad , low rock seemed to grow out of it , and upon the rock stood the lordliest house my childish eyes had ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 16]: Take situation and all , and I have scarcely yet beheld one to equal it .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 36]: Half castle , half old English country seat , it covered the rock with a huge square of building , from various parts of which rose towers , mostly square also , of different heights .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 11]: I stood for one brief moment entranced with awful delight .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 31]: A building which has grown for ages , the outcome of the life of powerful generations , has about it a majesty which , in certain moods , is overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 12]: For one brief moment I forgot my sin and its sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 8]: But memory awoke with a fresh pang .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 18]: To this lordly place I , poor miserable sinner , was a debtor by wrong and shame .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 42]: Let no one laugh at me because my sin was small : it was enough for me , being that of one who had stolen for the first time , and that without previous declension , and searing of the conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 12]: I hurried towards the building , anxiously looking for some entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 81]: I had approached so near that , seated on its rock , it seemed to shoot its towers into the zenith , when , rounding a corner , I came to a part where the height sank from the foundation of the house to the level by a grassy slope , and at the foot of the slope espied an elderly gentleman , in a white hat , who stood with his hands in his breeches-pockets , looking about him .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 18]: He was tall and stout , and carried himself in what seemed to me a stately manner .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 41]: As I drew near him I felt somewhat encouraged by a glimpse of his face , which was rubicund and , I thought , good-natured ; but , approaching him rather from behind , I could not see it well .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 23]: When I addressed him he started , ` Please , sir , ' I said , ` is this your house ? '
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 30]: ` Yes , my man ; it is my house , ' he answered , looking down on me with bent neck , his hands still in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 31]: ` Please , sir , ' I said , but here my voice began to tremble , and he grew dim and large through the veil of my gathering tears .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 3]: I hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 9]: ` Well , what do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 12]: he asked , in a tone half jocular , half kind .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 10]: I made a great effort and recovered my self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 19]: ` Please , sir , ' I repeated , ' I want you to box my ears . '
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: ` Well , you are a funny fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 11]: What should I box your ears for , pray ? '
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 34]: ` Because I 've been very wicked , ' I answered ; and , putting my hand into my pocket , I extracted the bitten apple , and held it up to him .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 3]: ` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 3]: ho ! '
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 28]: he said , beginning to guess what I must mean , but hardly the less bewildered for that ; ` is that one of my apples ? '
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 12]: It fell down from a branch that hung over the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 26]: I took it up , and -- and -- I took a bite of it , and -- and -- I 'm so sorry ! '
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 17]: Here I burst into a fit of crying which I choked as much as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 25]: I remember quite well how , as I stood holding out the apple , my arm would shake with the violence of my sobs .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 13]: ` I 'm not fond of bitten apples , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 10]: ` You had better eat it up now . '
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 6]: This brought me to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 15]: If he had shown me sympathy , I should have gone on crying . '
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 5]: I would rather not .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: Please box my ears . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 9]: I do n't want to box your ears .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: You 're welcome to the apple .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 13]: Only do n't take what 's not your own another time . '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 13]: ` But , please , sir , I 'm so miserable ! '
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 5]: ` Home with you !
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 15]: and eat your apple as you go , ' was his unconsoling response . '
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 14]: I ca n't eat it ; I 'm so ashamed of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 15]: ` When people do wrong , I suppose they must be ashamed of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 10]: That 's all right , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 12]: ` Why wo n't you box my ears , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 3]: I persisted .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 23]: -LSB- Illustration : `` HERE IS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN , MRS. WILSON , WHO SEEMS TO HAVE LOST HIS WAY . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: It was my sole but unavailing prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 7]: He turned away towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 6]: My trouble rose to agony .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 15]: I made some wild motion of despair , and threw myself on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 30]: He turned , looked at me for a moment in silence , and then said in a changed tone -- ` My boy , I am sorry for you .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: I beg you will not trouble yourself any more .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 7]: The affair is not worth it .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 4]: Such a trifle !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 8]: What can I do for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 4]: I got up .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 11]: A new thought of possible relief had crossed my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 21]: ` Please , sir , if you wo n't box my ears , will you shake hands with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 24]: ` To be sure I will , ' he answered , holding out his hand , and giving mine a very kindly shake .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 8]: ` Where do you live ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 13]: I am at school at Aldwick , at Mr Elder 's . '
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 10]: ` You 're a long way from home ! '
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 6]: ` Am I , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 8]: Will you tell me how to go ?
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 7]: But it 's of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 11]: I do n't mind anything now you 've forgiven me .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 7]: I shall soon run home . '
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 6]: ` Come with me first .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 8]: You must have something to eat . '
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 15]: I wanted nothing to eat , but how could I oppose anything he said ?
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 13]: I followed him at once , drying my eyes as I went .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 64]: He led me to a great gate which I had passed before , and opening a wicket , took me across a court , and through another building where I saw many servants going about ; then across a second court , which was paved with large flags , and so to a door which he opened , calling -- ` Mrs Wilson !
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 3]: Mrs Wilson !
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: I want you a moment . '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 29]: ` Yes , Sir Giles , ' answered a tall , stiff-looking elderly woman who presently appeared descending , with upright spine , a corkscrew staircase of stone .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 18]: ` Here is a young gentleman , Mrs Wilson , who seems to have lost his way .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 11]: He is one of Mr Elder 's pupils at Aldwick .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 18]: Will you get him something to eat and drink , and then send him home ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 7]: I will , Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 17]: ` Good-bye , my man , ' said Sir Giles , again shaking hands with me .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 37]: Then turning anew to the housekeeper , for such I found she was , he added : ` Could n't you find a bag for him , and fill it with some of those brown pippins ?
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 10]: They 're good eating , ai n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 8]: ` With pleasure , Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 23]: Thereupon Sir Giles withdrew , closing the door behind him , and leaving me with the sense of life from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 10]: ` What 's your name , young gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 14]: asked Mrs Wilson , with , I thought , some degree of sternness .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 8]: ` Wilfrid Cumbermede , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 20]: She stared at me a little , with a stare which would have been a start in most women .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 15]: I was by this time calm enough to take a quiet look at her .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 22]: She was dressed in black silk , with a white neckerchief crossing in front , and black mittens on her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 37]: After gazing at me fixedly for a moment or two , she turned away and ascended the stair , which went up straight from the door , saying -- ` Come with me , Master Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: You must have some tea before you go . '
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 33]: I obeyed , and followed her into a long , low-ceiled room , wainscotted all over in panels , with a square moulding at the top , which served for a cornice .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 8]: The ceiling was ornamented with plaster reliefs .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 19]: The windows looked out , on one side into the court , on the other upon the park .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 46]: The floor was black and polished like a mirror , with bits of carpet here and there , and a rug before the curious , old-fashioned grate , where a little fire was burning and a small kettle boiling fiercely on the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 8]: The tea-tray was already on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 36]: She got another cup and saucer , added a pot of jam to the preparations , and said : ` Sit down and have some bread and butter , while I make the tea . '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 33]: She cut me a great piece of bread , and then a great piece of butter , and I lost no time in discovering that the quality was worthy of the quantity .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: Mrs Wilson kept a grave silence for a good while .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 38]: At last , as she was pouring out the second cup , she looked at me over the teapot , and said -- ` You do n't remember your mother , I suppose , Master Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: ` No , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 7]: I never saw my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 8]: ` Within your recollection , you mean .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 18]: But you must have seen her , for you were two years old when she died . '
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 12]: ` Did you know my mother , then , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 36]: I asked , but without any great surprise , for the events of the day had been so much out of the ordinary that I had for the time almost lost the faculty of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 31]: She compressed her thin lips , and a perpendicular wrinkle appeared in the middle of her forehead , as she answered -- ` Yes ; I knew your mother . '
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 13]: ` She was very good , was n't she , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 12]: I said , with my mouth full of bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: Who told you that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 6]: I was sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 6]: Nobody ever told me . '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 11]: ` Did they never talk to you about her ? '
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 6]: ` No , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 13]: ` So you are at Mr Elder 's , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 26]: she said , after another long pause , during which I was not idle , for my trouble being gone I could now be hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: ` Yes , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 11]: ` How did you come here , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 18]: I walked with the rest of the boys ; but they are gone home without me . '
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 30]: Thanks to the kindness of Sir Giles , my fault had already withdrawn so far into the past , that I wished to turn my back upon it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: I saw no need for confessing it to Mrs Wilson ; and there was none .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 8]: ` Did you lose your way ? '
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 6]: ` No , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 8]: ` What brought you here , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 10]: I suppose you wanted to see the place . '
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 17]: ` The woman at the lodge told us the nearest way was through the park . '
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 22]: I quite expected she would go on cross-questioning me , and then all the truth would have had to come out .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 36]: But to my great relief , she went no further , only kept eyeing me in a manner so oppressive as to compel me to eat bread and butter and strawberry jam with self-defensive eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 11]: I presume she trusted to find out the truth by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 61]: She contented herself in the mean time with asking questions about my uncle and aunt , the farm , the school , and Mr and Mrs Elder , all in a cold , stately , refraining manner , with two spots of red in her face -- one on each cheek-bone , and a thin rather peevish nose dividing them .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 20]: But her forehead was good , and when she smiled , which was not often , her eyes shone .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 32]: Still , even I , with my small knowledge of womankind , was dimly aware that she was feeling her way with me , and I did not like her much .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 7]: ` Have you nearly done ? '
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 5]: she asked at length .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: ` Yes , quite , thank you , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 10]: ` Are you going back to school to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: ` Yes , ma'am ; of course . '
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 7]: ` How are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 22]: ` If you will tell me the way -- ' ` Do you know how far you are from Aldwick ? '
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 6]: ` No , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 17]: ` Eight miles , ' she answered ; ` and it 's getting rather late . '
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 26]: I was seated opposite the windows to the park , and , looking up , saw with some dismay that the air was getting dusky .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 13]: I rose at once , saying -- ' I must make haste .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 8]: They will think I am lost . '
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 13]: ` But you can never walk so far , Master Cumbermede . '
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: ` Oh , but I must !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 6]: I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 10]: I must get back as fast as possible . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 9]: ` You never can walk such a distance .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 16]: Take another bit of cake while I go and see what can be done . '
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 25]: Another piece of cake being within the bounds of possibility , I might at least wait and see what Mrs Wilson 's design was .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 12]: She left the room , and I turned to the cake .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 16]: In a little while she came back , sat down , and went on talking .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 36]: I was beginning to get quite uneasy , when a maid put her head in at the door , and said -- ` Please , Mrs Wilson , the dog-cart 's ready , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 38]: ` Very well , ' replied Mrs Wilson , and turning to me , said -- more kindly than she had yet spoken -- ` Now , Master Cumbermede , you must come and see me again .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 48]: I 'm too busy to spare much time when the family is at home ; but they are all going away the week after next , and if you will come and see me then , I shall be glad to show you over the house . '
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 29]: As she spoke she rose and led the way from the room , and out of the court by another gate from that by which I had entered .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: At the bottom of a steep descent , a groom was waiting with the dog-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 29]: ` Here , James , ' said Mrs Wilson , ` take good care of the young gentleman , and put him down safe at Mr Elder 's .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 12]: Master Wilfrid , you 'll find a hamper of apples underneath .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 12]: You had better not eat them all yourself , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 14]: Here are two or three for you to eat by the way . '
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 38]: No ; I 'm not quite so greedy as that , ' I answered gaily , for my spirits were high at the notion of a ride in the dog-cart instead of a long and dreary walk .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 32]: When I was fairly in , she shook hands with me , reminding me that I was to visit her soon , and away went the dog-cart behind a high-stepping horse .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 25]: I had never before been in an open vehicle of any higher description than a cart , and the ride was a great delight .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 13]: We went a different road from that which my companions had taken .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 15]: It lay through trees all the way till we were out of the park .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 12]: ` That 's the land-steward 's house , ' said James .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 7]: ` Oh , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 7]: I returned , not much interested .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: ` What great trees those are all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 18]: ` Yes ; they 're the finest elms in all the county those , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 22]: ` Old Coningham knew what he was about when he got the last baronet to let him build his nest there .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: Here we are at the gate ! '
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 26]: We came out upon a country road , which ran between the wall of the park and a wooden fence along a field of grass .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 12]: I offered James one of my apples , which he accepted .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 6]: ` There , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 9]: he said , ` there 's a field !
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 10]: -- A right good bit o ' grass that !
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 15]: Our people has wanted to throw it into the park for hundreds of years .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 12]: But they wo n't part with it for love or money .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 18]: It ought by rights to be ours , you see , by the lie of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 9]: It 's all one grass with the park .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 14]: But I suppose them as owns it ai n't of the same mind .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 8]: -- Cur ` ous old box ! '
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 12]: he added , pointing with his whip a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 11]: ` You can just see the roof of it . '
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 8]: I looked in the direction he pointed .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 14]: A rise in the ground hid all but an ancient , high-peaked roof .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 15]: What was my astonishment to discover in it the roof of my own home !
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: I was certain it could be no other .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 68]: It caused a strange sensation , to come upon it thus from the outside , as it were , when I thought myself miles and miles away from it , I fell a-pondering over the matter ; and as I reflected , I became convinced that the trees from which we had just emerged were the same which used to churn the wind for my childish fancies .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 30]: I did not feel inclined to share my feelings with my new acquaintance ; but presently he put his whip in the socket and fell to eating his apple .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 14]: There was nothing more in the conversation he afterwards resumed deserving of record .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 20]: He pulled up at the gate of the school , where I bade him good-night and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 69]: There was great rejoicing over me when I entered , for the boys had arrived without me a little while before , having searched all about the place where we had parted company , and come at length to the conclusion that I had played them a trick in order to get home without them , there having been some fun on the road concerning my local stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 26]: Mr Elder , however , took me to his own room , and read me a lecture on the necessity of not abusing my privileges .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 18]: I told him the whole affair from beginning to end , and thought he behaved very oddly .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 30]: He turned away every now and then , blew his nose , took off his spectacles , wiped them carefully , and replaced them before turning again to me .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 10]: ` Go on , go on , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 9]: I 'm listening , ' he would say .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: I can not tell whether he was laughing or crying .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 4]: I suspect both .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 21]: When I had finished , he said , very solemnly -- ` Wilfrid , you have had a narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 23]: I need not tell you how wrong you were about the apple , for you know that as well as I do .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 12]: But you did the right thing when your eyes were opened .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 14]: I am greatly pleased with you , and greatly obliged to Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 11]: I will write and thank him this very night . '
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 12]: ` Please , sir , ought I to tell the boys ?
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 6]: I would rather not . '
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 8]: I do not think it necessary . '
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 7]: He rose and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 10]: ` Ask Master Fox to step this way . '
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 14]: Fox was the oldest boy , and was on the point of leaving .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 15]: ` Fox , ' said Mr Elder , ` Cumbermede has quite satisfied me .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 10]: Will you oblige me by asking him no questions .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 35]: I am quite aware such a request must seem strange , but I have good reasons for making it , ' ` Very well , sir , ' said Fox , glancing at me .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: ` Take him with you , then , and tell the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 15]: It is as a favour to myself that I put it , Fox . '
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 9]: ` That is quite enough , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 19]: Fox took me to Mrs Elder , and had a talk with the rest before I saw them .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 12]: Some twenty years after , Fox and I had it out .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 18]: I gave him a full explanation , for by that time I could smile over the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 7]: But what does the object matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 9]: -- an apple , or a thousand pounds ?
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 11]: It is but the peg on which the act hangs .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 5]: The act is everything .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 25]: To the honour of my school-fellows I record that not one of them ever let fall a hint in the direction of the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 11]: Neither did Mr or Mrs Elder once allude to it .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 8]: If possible they were kinder than before .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 6]: CHAPTER X. I BUILD CASTLES .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 45]: My companions had soon found out , and I think the discovery had something to do with the kindness they always showed me , that I was a good hand at spinning a yarn : the nautical phrase had got naturalized in the school .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 38]: We had no chance , if we would have taken it , of spending any part of school-hours in such a pastime ; but it formed an unfailing amusement when weather or humour interfered with bodily exercises .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 35]: Nor were we debarred from the pleasure after we had retired for the night , -- only , as we were parted in three rooms , I could not have a large audience then .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 14]: I well remember , however , one occasion on which it was otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 43]: The report of a super-excellent invention having gone abroad , one by one they came creeping into my room , after I and my companion were in bed , until we lay three in each bed , all being present but Fox .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 80]: At the very heart of the climax , when a spectre was appearing and disappearing momently with the drawing in and sending out of his breath , so that you could not tell the one moment where he might show himself the next , Mr Elder walked into the room with his chamber-candle in his hand , straightway illuminating six countenances pale with terror -- for I took my full share of whatever emotion I roused in the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 22]: But instead of laying a general interdict on the custom , he only said , ` Come , come , boys !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 7]: it 's time you were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 7]: Go to your rooms directly . '
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 36]: ` Please , sir , ' faltered one -- Moberly by name -- the dullest and most honourable boy , to my thinking , amongst us , ` may n't I stay where I am ?
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 10]: Cumbermede has put me all in a shiver . '
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 26]: Mr Elder laughed , and turning to me , asked with his usual good-humour , ` How long will your story take , Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 14]: ` As long as you please , sir , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 15]: I ca n't let you keep them awake all night , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 14]: ` There 's no fear of that , sir , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 16]: ` Moberly would have been asleep long ago if it had n't been a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 8]: Nothing keeps him awake but ghosts . '
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 11]: ` Well , is the ghost nearly done with ? '
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 6]: ` Not quite , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 8]: The worst is to come yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 40]: ` Please , sir , ' interposed Moberly , ` if you 'll let me stay where I am , I 'll turn round on my deaf ear , and wo n't listen to a word more of it .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 12]: It 's awful , I do assure you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 5]: Mr Elder laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 17]: ` Make haste and finish your story , Cumbermede , and let them go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 25]: You , Moberly , may stay where you are for the night , but I ca n't have this made a practice of . '
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 13]: ` No , no , sir , ' said several at once .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 14]: ` But why do n't you tell your stories by daylight , Cumbermede ?
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 12]: I 'm sure you have time enough for them then . '
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 19]: ` Oh , but he 's got one going for the day and another for the night . '
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 12]: ` Then do you often lie three in a bed ? '
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 7]: asked Mr Elder with some concern .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 6]: ` Oh no , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 12]: Only this is an extra good one , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 13]: Mr Elder laughed again , bade us good-night , and left us .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 8]: The horror , however , was broken .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 31]: I could not call up one ` shiver more , and in a few minutes Moberly , as well as his two companions , had slipped away to roomier quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 40]: The material of the tales I told my companions was in part supplied from some of my uncle 's old books , for in his little library there were more than the _ Arcadia _ of the same sort .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 41]: But these had not merely afforded me the stuff to remodel and imitate ; their spirit had wrought upon my spirit , and armour and war-horses and mighty swords were only the instruments with which faithful knights wrought honourable deeds .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 41]: I had a tolerably clear perception that such deeds could not be done in our days ; that there were no more dragons lying in the woods : and that ladies did not now fall into the hands of giants .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 32]: But I had the witness of an eternal impulse in myself that noble deeds had yet to be done , and therefore might be done , although I knew not how .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 39]: Hence a feeling of the dignity of ancient descent , as involving association with great men and great actions of old , and therefore rendering such more attainable in the future , took deep root in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 38]: Aware of the humbleness of my birth , and unrestrained by pride in my parents -- I had lost them so early -- I would indulge in many a day-dream of what I would gladly have been .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 34]: I would ponder over the delights of having a history , and how grand it would be to find I was descended from some far-away knight who had done deeds of high emprise .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 36]: In such moods the recollection of the old sword that had vanished from the wall would return : indeed the impression it had made upon me may have been at the root of it all .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 10]: How I longed to know the story of it !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 10]: But it had gone to the grave with grannie .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 35]: If my uncle or aunt knew it , I had no hope of getting it from either of them ; for I was certain they had no sympathy with any such fancies as mine .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 53]: My favourite invention , one for which my audience was sure to call when I professed incompetence , and which I enlarged and varied every time I returned to it , was of a youth in humble life who found at length he was of far other origin then he had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 27]: I did not know then , that the fancy , not uncommon with boys , has its roots in the deepest instincts of our human nature .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 23]: I need not add that I had not yet read Jean Paul 's _ Titan , or Hesperus , or Comet _ .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 29]: This tendency of thought-received a fresh impulse from my visit to Moldwarp Hall , as I choose to name the great house whither my repentance had led me .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 17]: It was the first I had ever seen to wake the sense of the mighty antique .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 38]: My home was , no doubt , older than some parts of the hall ; but the house we are born in never looks older than the last generation until we begin to compare it with others .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 41]: By this time , what I had learned of the history of my country , and the general growth of the allied forces of my intellect , had rendered me capable of feeling the hoary eld of the great Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: Henceforth it had a part in every invention of my boyish imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 25]: I was therefore not undesirous of keeping the half-engagement I had made with Mrs Wilson , but it was not she that drew me .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 44]: With all her kindness , she had not attracted me , for cupboard-love is not the sole , or always the most powerful , operant on the childish mind : it is in general stronger in men than in either children or women .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 22]: I would rather not see Mrs Wilson again -- she had fed my body , she had not warmed my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 10]: It was the grand old house that attracted me .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 43]: True , it was associated with shame , but rather with the recovery from it than with the fall itself ; and what memorials of ancient grandeur and knightly ways must lie within those walls , to harmonize with my many dreams !
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 17]: On the next holiday , Mr Elder gave me a ready permission to revisit Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 25]: I had made myself acquainted with the nearest way by crossroads and footpaths , and full of expectation , set out with my companions .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 37]: They accompanied me the greater part of the distance , and left me at a certain gate , the same by which they had come out of the park on the day of my first visit .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 19]: I was glad when they were gone , for I could then indulge my excited fancy at will .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 10]: I heard their voices draw away into the distance .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 13]: I was alone on a little footpath which led through a wood .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 49]: All about me were strangely tall and slender oaks ; but as I advanced into the wood , the trees grew more various , and in some of the opener spaces great old oaks , short and big-headed , stretched out their huge shadow-filled arms in true oak-fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 32]: The ground was uneven , and the path led up and down over hollow and hillock , now crossing a swampy bottom , now climbing the ridge of a rocky eminence .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 13]: It was a lovely forenoon , with grey-blue sky and white clouds .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 14]: The sun shone plentifully into the wood , for the leaves were thin .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 28]: They hung like clouds of gold and royal purple above my head , layer over layer , with the blue sky and the snowy clouds shining through .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 46]: On the ground it was a world of shadows and sunny streaks , kept ever in interfluent motion by such a wind as John Skelton describes : ` There blew in that gardynge a soft piplyng cold Enbrethyng of Zepherus with his pleasant wynde . '
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 5]: I went merrily along .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 14]: The birds were not singing , but my heart did not need them .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 13]: It was Spring-time there , whatever it might be in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 13]: The heaven of my childhood wanted no lark to make it gay .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 22]: Had the trees been bare , and the frost shining on the ground , it would have been all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 5]: The sunlight was enough .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 52]: I was standing on the root of a great beech-tree , gazing up into the gulf of its foliage , and watching the broken lights playing about in the leaves and leaping from twig to branch , like birds yet more golden than the leaves , when a voice startled me .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 13]: ` You 're not looking for apples in a beech-tree , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 3]: it said .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 11]: I turned instantly , with my heart in a flutter .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 22]: To my great relief I saw that the speaker was not Sir Giles , and that probably no allusion was intended .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 32]: But my first apprehension made way only for another pang , for , although I did not know the man , a strange dismay shot through me at sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 21]: His countenance was associated with an undefined but painful fact that lay crouching in a dusky hollow of my memory .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: I had no time now to entice it into the light of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 6]: I took heart and spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 19]: ` No , ' I answered ; ' I was only watching the sun on the leaves . '
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 8]: ` Very pretty , ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 6]: Ah , it 's lovely !
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 10]: It 's quite beautiful -- ai n't it now ?
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 9]: You like good timber , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 6]: Trees , I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 15]: he explained , aware , I suppose , of some perplexity on my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 8]: I like big old ones best . '
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 38]: ` Yes , yes , ' he returned , with an energy that sounded strange and jarring to my mood ; ` big old ones , that have stood for ages -- the monarchs of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 9]: Saplings ai n't bad things either , though .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 6]: But old ones are best .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 14]: Just come here , and I 'll show you one worth looking at .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 16]: _ It _ was n't planted yesterday , _ I _ can tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 15]: I followed him along the path , until we came out of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 24]: Beyond us the ground rose steep and high , and was covered with trees ; but here in the hollow it was open .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 10]: A stream ran along between us and the height .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 18]: On this side of the stream stood a mighty tree , towards which my companion led me .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 32]: It was an oak , with such a bushy head and such great roots rising in serpent rolls and heaves above the ground , that the stem looked stunted between them .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 10]: said my companion ; ` there 's a tree !
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 7]: there 's something like a tree !
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 14]: How a man must feel to call a tree like that his own !
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 7]: That 's Queen Elizabeth 's oak .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 4]: It is indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 33]: England is dotted with would-be Queen Elizabeth 's oaks ; but there is the very oak which she admired so much that she ordered luncheon to be served under it ... Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 12]: she knew the value of timber -- did good Queen Bess .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 35]: _ That 's _ now -- now -- let me see -- the year after the Armada -- nine from fifteen -- ah well , somewhere about two hundred and thirty years ago . '
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 9]: ` How lumpy and hard it looks ! '
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 3]: I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 15]: ` That 's the breed and the age of it , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 20]: ` The wonder to me is they do n't turn to stone and last for ever , those trees .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 9]: there 's something to live for now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 42]: He had turned away to resume his walk , but as he finished the sentence , he turned again towards the tree , and shook his finger at it , as if reproaching it for belonging to somebody else than himself .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 8]: ` Where are you going now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 34]: he asked , wheeling round upon me sharply , with a keen look in his magpie-eyes , as the French would call them , which hardly corresponded with the bluntness of his address .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 15]: ` I 'm going to the Hall , ' I answered , turning away .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: ` You 'll never get there that way .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 10]: How are you to cross the river ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 9]: I 've never been this way before . '
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 11]: ` You 've been to the Hall before , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 7]: Whom do you know there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 8]: ` Mrs Wilson , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 4]: ` H 'm !
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 8]: You know Mrs Wilson , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 7]: Nice woman , Mrs Wilson ! '
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 10]: He said this as if he meant the opposite .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 13]: ` Here , ' he went on -- ` come with me .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 8]: I 'll show you the way . '
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 13]: I obeyed , and followed him along the bank of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 7]: ` What a curious bridge ! '
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 25]: I exclaimed , as we came in sight of an ancient structure lifted high in the middle on the point of a Gothic arch .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 7]: ` Yes , ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 3]: ` Curious ?
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 5]: I should think so !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 6]: And well it may be !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 11]: It 's as old as the oak there at least .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 17]: There 's a bridge now for a man like Sir Giles to call his own ! '
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 38]: ` He ca n't keep it though , ' I said , moralizing ; for , in carrying on the threads of my stories , I had come to see that no climax could last for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 6]: ` Ca n't keep it !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 13]: He could carry off every stone of it if he liked . '
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 12]: ` Then it would n't be the bridge any longer . '
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 12]: ` You 're a sharp one , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 12]: I do n't know , ' I answered , truly enough .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 13]: I seemed to myself to be talking sense , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 6]: ` Well , I do .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 13]: What do you mean by saying he could n't keep it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 25]: ` It 's been a good many people 's already , and it 'll be somebody else 's some day , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 31]: He did not seem to relish the suggestion , for he gave a kind of grunt , which gradually broke into a laugh as he answered , ` Likely enough !
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 4]: likely enough ! '
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 27]: We had now come round to the end of the bridge , and I saw that it was far more curious than I had perceived before .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 8]: ` Why is it so narrow ? '
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 29]: I asked , wonderingly , for it was not three feet wide , and had a parapet of stone about three feet high on each side of it .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 11]: he replied , ` that 's it , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 6]: As old as the hills .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 30]: It was built , _ this _ bridge was , before ever a carriage was made -- yes , before ever a carrier 's cart went along a road .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 9]: They carried everything then upon horses ' backs .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 7]: They call this the pack-horse bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 21]: You see there 's room for the horses ' legs , and their loads could stick out over the parapets .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 12]: That 's the way they carried everything to the Hall then .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 16]: That was a few years before _ you _ were born , young gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 39]: ` But they could n't get their legs -- the horses , I mean -- could n't get their legs through this narrow opening , ' I objected ; for a flat stone almost blocked up each end .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 8]: ` No ; that 's true enough .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 13]: But those stones have been up only a hundred years or so .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 45]: They did n't want it for pack-horses any more then , and the stones were put up to keep the cattle , with which at some time or other I suppose some thrifty owner had stocked the park , from crossing to this meadow .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: That would be before those trees were planted up there . '
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 31]: When we had crossed the stream , he stopped at the other end of the bridge and said , ` Now , you go that way -- up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 20]: There 's a kind of path , if you can find it , but it does n't much matter .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 4]: Good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 17]: He walked away down the bank of the stream , while I struck into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 58]: When I reached the top , and emerged from the trees that skirted the ridge , there stood the lordly Hall before me , shining in autumnal sunlight , with gilded vanes and diamond-paned windows , as if it were a rock against which the gentle waves of the sea of light rippled and broke in flashes .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 33]: When you looked at its foundation , which seemed to have torn its way up through the clinging sward , you could not tell where the building began and the rock ended .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 27]: In some parts indeed the rock was wrought into the walls of the house ; while in others it was faced up with stone and mortar .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 8]: My heart beat high with vague rejoicing .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 30]: Grand as the aged oak had looked , here was a grander growth -- a growth older too than the oak , and inclosing within it a thousand histories .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 12]: I approached the gate by which Mrs Wilson had dismissed me .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 50]: A flight of rude steps cut in the rock led to the portcullis , which still hung , now fixed in its place in front of the gate ; for though the Hall had no external defences , it had been well fitted for the half-sieges of troublous times .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 76]: A modern mansion stands , with its broad sweep up to the wide door , like its hospitable owner in full dress and broad-bosomed shirt on his own hearth-rug : this ancient house stood with its back to the world , like one of its ancient owners , ready to ride , in morion , breast-plate , and jack-boots -- yet not armed _ cap-à-pie _ , not like a walled castle , that is .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 29]: I ascended the steps , and stood before the arch -- filled with a great iron-studded oaken gate -- which led through a square tower into the court .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 12]: I stood gazing for some minutes before I rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 7]: Two things in particular I noticed .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 35]: The first was -- over the arch of the doorway , amongst others -- one device very like the animal 's head upon the watch and the seal which my great-grandmother had given me .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 27]: I could not be sure it was the same , for the shape -- both in the stone and in my memory -- was considerably worn .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 7]: The other interested me far more .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 23]: In the great gate was a small wicket , so small that there was hardly room for me to pass without stooping .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 8]: A thick stone threshold lay before it .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 41]: The spot where the right foot must fall in stepping out of the wicket was worn into the shape of a shoe , to the depth of between three and four inches I should judge , vertically into the stone .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 30]: The deep foot-mould conveyed to me a sense of the coming and going of generations , such as I could not gather from the age-worn walls of the building .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 19]: A great bell-handle at the end of a jointed iron-rod hung down by the side of the wicket .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 3]: I rang .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 13]: An old woman opened the wicket , and allowed me to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 58]: I thought I remembered the way to Mrs Wilson 's door well enough , but when I ascended the few broad steps , curved to the shape of the corner in which the entrance stood , and found myself in the flagged court , I was bewildered , and had to follow the retreating portress for directions .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 16]: A word set me right , and I was soon in Mrs Wilson 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 22]: She received me kindly , and expressed her satisfaction that I had kept what she was pleased to consider my engagement .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 42]: After some refreshment and a little talk , Mrs Wilson said , ` Now , Master Cumbermede , would you like to go and see the gardens , or take a walk in the park and look at the deer ? '
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 20]: ` Please , Mrs Wilson , ' I returned , ` you promised to show me the house . '
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 10]: ` You would like that , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' I answered , -- ` better than anything . '
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 19]: ` Come , then , ' she said , and took a bunch of keys from the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 15]: ` Some of the rooms I lock up when the family 's away . '
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 6]: It was a vast place .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 35]: Roughly it may be described as a large oblong which the great hall , with the kitchen and its offices , divided into two square courts -- the one flagged , the other gravelled .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 18]: A passage dividing the hall from the kitchen led through from the one court to the other .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 41]: We entered this central portion through a small tower ; and , after a peep at the hall , ascended to a room above the entrance , accessible from an open gallery which ran along two sides of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 14]: The room was square , occupying the area-space of the little entrance tower .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 31]: To my joyous amazement , its walls were crowded with swords , daggers -- weapons in endless variety , mingled with guns and pistols , for which I cared less .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 15]: Some which had hilts curiously carved and even jewelled , seemed of foreign make .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 25]: Their character was different from that of the rest ; but most were evidently of the same family with the one sword I knew .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 9]: Mrs Wilson could tell me nothing about them .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 29]: All she knew was that this was the armoury , and that Sir Giles had a book with something written in it about every one of the weapons .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 11]: They were no chance collection : each had a history .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 7]: I gazed in wonder and delight .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 25]: Above the weapons hung many pieces of armour -- no entire suits , however ; of those there were several in the hall below .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 34]: Finding that Mrs Wilson did not object to my handling the weapons within my reach , I was soon so much absorbed in the examination of them that I started when she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 13]: ` You shall come again , Master Cumbermede , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 7]: ` We must go now . '
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 12]: I replaced a Highland broadsword , and turned to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 33]: She was evidently pleased with the alacrity of my obedience , and for the first time bestowed on me a smile as she led the way from the armoury by another door .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: To my enhanced delight this door led into the library .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 59]: Gladly would I have lingered , but Mrs Wilson walked on , and I followed through rooms and rooms , low-pitched , and hung with tapestry , some carpeted , some floored with black polished oak , others with some kind of cement or concrete , all filled with ancient furniture whose very aspect was a speechless marvel .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 105]: Out of one into another , along endless passages , up and down winding stairs , now looking from the summit of a lofty tower upon terraces and gardens below -- now lost in gloomy arches , again out upon acres of leads , and now bathed in the sweet gloom of the ancient chapel with its stained windows of that old glass which seems nothing at first , it is so modest and harmonious , but which for that very reason grows into a poem in the brain : you see it last and love it best -- I followed with unabating delight .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 37]: When at length Mrs Wilson said I had seen the whole , I begged her to let me go again into the library , for she had not given me a moment to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 3]: She consented .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 26]: It was a part of the house not best suited for the purpose , connected with the armoury by a descent of a few steps .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 23]: It lay over some of the housekeeping department , was too near the great hall , and looked into the flagged court .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 32]: A library should be on the ground-floor in a quiet wing , with an outlook on grass , and the possibility of gaining it at once without going through long passages .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: Nor was the library itself , architecturally considered , at all superior to its position .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 46]: The books had greatly outgrown the space allotted to them , and several of the neighbouring rooms had been annexed as occasion required ; hence it consisted of half-a-dozen rooms , some of them merely closets intended for dressing-rooms , and all very ill lighted .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 17]: I entered it however in no critical spirit , but with a feeling of reverential delight .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 11]: My uncle 's books had taught me to love books .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 47]: I had been accustomed to consider his five hundred volumes a wonderful library ; but here were thousands -- as old , as musty , as neglected , as dilapidated , therefore as certainly full of wonder and discovery , as man or boy could wish .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 14]: -- Oh the treasures of a house that has been growing for ages !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 40]: I leave a whole roomful of lethal weapons , to descend three steps into six roomfuls of books -- each ` the precious life-blood of a master-spirit ' -- for as yet in my eyes all books were worthy !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 6]: Which did I love best ?
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 6]: Old swords or old books ?
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 5]: I could not tell !
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 16]: I had only the grace to know which I _ ought _ to love best .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 28]: As we passed from the first room into the second , up rose a white thing from the corner of the window-seat , and came towards us .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 3]: I started .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 7]: Mrs Wilson exclaimed : ` La !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 3]: Miss Clara !
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 4]: how ever -- ?
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 10]: The rest was lost in the abyss of possibility .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 21]: ` They told me you were somewhere about , Mrs Wilson , and I thought I had better wait here .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 6]: How do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 14]: ` La , child , you 've given me such a turn ! '
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 4]: said Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 19]: ` You might have been a ghost if it had been in the middle of the night . '
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 26]: -LSB- Illustration : SHE WAS A YEAR OR TWO OLDER THAN MYSELF , I THOUGHT , AND THE LOVLIEST CREATURE I HAD EVER SEEN . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 15]: ` I 'm very sorry , Mrs Wilson , ' said the girl merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 18]: ` Only you see if it had been a ghost it could n't have been me . '
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 10]: ` How 's your papa , Miss Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 7]: he 's always quite well . '
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 8]: ` When did you see him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 3]: ` To-day .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: He 's at home with grandpapa now . '
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 10]: ` And you ran away and left him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 5]: ` Not quite that .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 20]: He and grandpapa went out about some business -- to the copse at Deadman 's Hollow , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 22]: They did n't want my advice -- they never do ; so I came to see you , Mrs Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 13]: By this time I had been able to look at the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 22]: She was a year or two older than myself , I thought , and the loveliest creature I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 52]: She had large blue eyes of the rare shade called violet , a little round perhaps , but the long lashes did something to rectify that fault ; and a delicate nose -- turned up a little of course , else at her age she could not have been so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 29]: Her mouth was well curved , expressing a full share of Paley 's happiness ; her chin was something large and projecting , but the lines were fine .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 35]: Her hair was a light brown , but dark for her eyes , and her complexion would have been enchanting to any one fond of the ` sweet mixture , red and white . '
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 19]: Her figure was that of a girl of thirteen , undetermined -- but therein I was not critical .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 28]: ` An exceeding fair forehead , ' to quote Sir Philip Sidney , and plump , white , dimple-knuckled hands complete the picture sufficiently for the present .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 33]: Indeed it would have been better to say only that I was taken with her , and then the reader might fancy her such as he would have been taken with himself .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 6]: But I was not fascinated .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 30]: It was only that I was a boy and she was a girl , and there being no element of decided repulsion , I felt kindly disposed towards her .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 6]: Mrs Wilson turned to me .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 20]: ` Well , Master Cumbermede , you see I am able to give you more than I promised . '
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 37]: ` Yes , ' I returned ; ` you promised to show me the old house -- ' ` And here , ' she interposed , ' I show you a young lady as well . '
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: ` Yes , thank you , ' I said simply .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: But I had a feeling that Mrs Wilson was not absolutely well-pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 41]: I was rather shy of Miss Clara -- not that I was afraid of her , but that I did not exactly know what was expected of me , and Mrs Wilson gave us no further introduction to each other .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 39]: I was not so shy , however , as not to wish Mrs Wilson would leave us together , for then , I thought , we should get on well enough ; but such was not her intent .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 46]: Desirous of being agreeable , however -- as far as I knew how , and remembering that Mrs Wilson had given me the choice before , I said to her -- ` Might n't we go and look at the deer , Mrs Wilson ? '
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 10]: ` You had better not , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 8]: ` They are rather ill-tempered just now .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 6]: They might run at you .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 15]: I heard them fighting last night , and knocking their horns together dreadfully . '
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 11]: ` Then we 'd better not , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 9]: ` They frightened me very much yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 9]: We were following Mrs Wilson from the room .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 10]: As we passed the hall-door , we peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 10]: ` Do you like such great high places ? '
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 3]: asked Clara .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 11]: ` Yes , I do , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 6]: I like great high places .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 7]: It makes you gasp somehow . '
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 7]: ` Are you fond of gasping ?
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 7]: Does it do you good ? '
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 16]: she asked , with a mock-simplicity which might be humour or something not so pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: ` Yes , I think it does , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 7]: ` It pleases me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 6]: I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 33]: I like a quiet snug place like the library -- not a great wide place like this , that looks as if it had swallowed you and did n't know it . '
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 9]: ` What a clever creature she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 3]: I thought .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 9]: We turned away and followed Mrs Wilson again .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 44]: I had expected to spend the rest of the day with her , but the moment we reached her apartment , she got out a bottle of her home-made wine and some cake , saying it was time for me to go home .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 20]: I was much disappointed -- the more that the pretty Clara remained behind ; but what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 17]: I strolled back to Aldwick with my head fuller than ever of fancies new and old .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 26]: But Mrs Wilson had said nothing of going to see her again , and without an invitation I could not venture to revisit the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 26]: In pondering over the events of the day , I gave the man I had met in the wood a full share in my meditations .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 6]: A TALK WITH MY UNCLE .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 45]: When I returned home for the Christmas holidays , I told my uncle , amongst other things , all that I have just recorded ; for although the affair seemed far away from me now , I felt that he ought to know it .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 13]: He was greatly pleased with my behaviour in regard to the apple .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 28]: He did not identify the place , however , until he heard the name of the housekeeper : then I saw a cloud pass over his face .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 26]: It grew deeper when I told him of my second visit , especially while I described the man I had met in the wood . '
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 15]: I have a strange fancy about him , uncle , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 27]: I think he must be the same man that came here one very stormy night -- long ago -- and wanted to take me away . '
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 8]: ` Who told you of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 5]: asked my uncle startled .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 9]: I explained that I had been a listener .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 10]: ` You ought not to have listened . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 12]: I know that now ; but I did not know then .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 10]: I woke frightened , and heard the voices . '
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 13]: ` What makes you think he was the same man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 9]: I ca n't be sure , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 27]: But as often as I think of the man I met in the wood , the recollection of that night comes back to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 4]: I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 6]: What was he like ? '
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: I described him as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 13]: ` Yes , ' said my uncle , ' I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 7]: He is a dangerous man . '
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 9]: ` What did he want with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 12]: ` He wanted to have something to do with your education .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 17]: He is an old friend -- acquaintance I ought to say -- of your father 's .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 11]: I should be sorry you had any intercourse with him .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 9]: He is a very worldly kind of man .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 10]: He believes in money and rank and getting on .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 11]: He believes in nothing else that , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 16]: ` Then I am sure I should n't like him , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 13]: I am pretty sure you would n't , ' returned my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 13]: I had never before heard him speak so severely of any one .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 20]: But from this time he began to talk to me more as if I had been a grown man .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 31]: There was a simplicity in his way of looking at things , however , which made him quite intelligible to a boy as yet uncorrupted by false aims or judgments .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 28]: He took me about with him constantly , and I began to see him as he was , and to honour and love him more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 8]: Christmas-day this year fell on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 6]: It was a model Christmas-day .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 11]: My uncle and I walked to church in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 35]: When we started , the grass was shining with frost , and the air was cold ; a fog hung about the horizon , and the sun shone through it with red rayless countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 53]: But before we reached the church , which was some three miles from home , the fog was gone , and the frost had taken shelter with the shadows ; the sun was dazzling without being clear , and the golden cock on the spire was glittering keen in the moveless air .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 15]: ` What do they put a cock on the spire for , uncle ? '
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 15]: ` To end off with an ornament , perhaps , ' he answered . '
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: I thought it had been to show how the wind blew . '
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 30]: ` Well , it would n't be the first time great things -- I mean the spire , not the cock -- had been put to little uses . '
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 21]: ` But why should it be a cock , ' I asked , ` more than any other bird ? '
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 25]: ` Some people -- those to whom the church is chiefly historical -- would tell you it is the cock that rebuked St Peter .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 38]: Whether it be so or not , I think a better reason for putting it there would be that the cock is the first creature to welcome the light , and tell people that it is coming .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 10]: Hence it is a symbol of the clergyman . '
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 12]: ` But our clergyman does n't wake the people , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 13]: I 've seen him send _ you _ to sleep sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 5]: My uncle laughed . '
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 14]: I dare say there are some dull cocks too , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 31]: ` There 's one at the farm , ' I said , ` which goes on crowing every now and then all night -- in his sleep -- Janet says .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 15]: But it never wakes till all the rest are out in the yard . '
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 5]: My uncle laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 41]: We had reached the churchyard , and by the time we had visited grannie 's grave -- that was the only one I thought of in the group of family mounds -- the bells had ceased , and we entered .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 34]: I at least did not sleep this morning ; not however because of the anti-somnolence of the clergyman -- but that , in a pew not far off from me , sat Clara .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 16]: I could see her as often as I pleased to turn my head half-way round .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 11]: Church is a very favourable place for falling in love .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 50]: It is all very well for the older people to shake their heads and say you ought to be minding the service -- that does not affect the fact stated -- especially when the clergyman is of the half-awake order who take to the church as a gentleman-like profession .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 48]: Having to sit so still , with the pretty face so near , with no obligation to pay it attention , but with perfect liberty to look at it , a boy in the habit of inventing stories could hardly help fancying himself in love with it .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 12]: Whether she saw me or not , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 27]: Although she passed me close as we came out , she did not look my way , and I had not the hardihood to address her .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 12]: As we were walking home , my uncle broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 17]: ` You would like to be an honourable man , would n't you , Willie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 10]: ` Yes , that I should , uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 9]: ` Could you keep a secret now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 6]: ` Yes , uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 13]: ` But there are two ways of keeping a secret . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 9]: I do n't know more than one . '
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 7]: ` Not to tell it . '
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 15]: ` Never to show that you knew it , would be better still . '
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 55]: ` Yes , it would -- ' ` But , suppose a thing : -- suppose you knew that there was a secret ; suppose you wanted very much to find it out , and yet would not try to find it out : would n't that be another way of keeping it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 6]: ` Yes , it would .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 17]: If I knew there was a secret , I should like to find it out . '
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 10]: ` Well , I am going to try you .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 5]: There is a secret .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 8]: I know it ; you do not .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 14]: You have a right to know it some day , but not yet .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 18]: I mean to tell it you , but I want you to learn a great deal first .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 10]: I want to keep the secret from hurting you .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 23]: Just as you would keep things from a baby which would hurt him , I have kept some things from you . '
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 11]: ` Is the sword one of them , uncle ? '
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 45]: ` You could not do anything with the secret if you did know it , ' my uncle went on , without heeding my question ; ` but there may be designing people who would make a tool of you for their own ends .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 9]: It is far better you should be ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 7]: Now will you keep my secret ?
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 13]: -- or , in other words , will you trust me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 6]: I felt a little frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 10]: My imagination was at work on the formless thing .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 17]: But I was chiefly afraid of the promise -- lest I should anyway break it . '
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 23]: I will try to keep the secret -- keep it from myself , that is -- ai n't it , uncle ? '
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 8]: That is just what I mean . '
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 13]: ` But how long will it be for , uncle ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 6]: I am not quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 11]: It will depend on how wise and sensible you grow .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 12]: Some boys are men at eighteen -- some not at forty .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 21]: The more reasonable and well-behaved you are , the sooner shall I feel at liberty to tell it you . '
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 8]: He ceased , and I remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 5]: I was not astonished .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 10]: The vague news fell in with all my fancies .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 34]: The possibility of something pleasant , nay even wonderful and romantic , of course suggested itself , and the hope which thence gilded the delay tended to reconcile me to my ignorance . '
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 21]: I think it better you should not go back to Mr Elder 's , Willie , ' said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 7]: I was stunned at the words .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 16]: Where could a place be found to compare for blessedness with Mr Elder 's school ?
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 20]: Not even the great Hall , with its acres of rooms and its age-long history , could rival it .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 13]: Some moments passed before I could utter a faltering ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 16]: ` That is part of my secret , Willie , ' answered my uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 21]: I know it will be a disappointment to you , for you have been very happy with Mr Elder . '
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 9]: ` Yes , indeed , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 27]: It was all I could say , for the tears were rolling down my cheeks , and there was a great lump in my throat . '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 17]: I am very sorry indeed to give you pain , Willie , ' he said kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 13]: ` It 's not my blame , is it , uncle ? '
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 3]: I sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 10]: ` Not in the least , my boy . '
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 11]: then , I do n't mind it so much . '
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 7]: ` There 's a brave boy !
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 12]: Now the question is , what to do with you . '
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 11]: ` Ca n't I stop at home , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: ` No , that wo n't do either , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 16]: I must have you taught , and I have n't time to teach you myself .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 15]: Neither am I scholar enough for it now ; my learning has got rusty .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 35]: I know your father would have wished to send you to college , and although I do not very well see how I can manage it , I must do the best I can .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 20]: I 'm not a rich man , you see , Willie , though I have a little laid by .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 20]: I never could do much at making money , and I must not leave your aunt unprovided for . '
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 5]: ` No , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 16]: Besides , I shall soon be able to work for myself and you too . '
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 14]: ` Not for a long time if you go to college , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 10]: But we need not talk about that yet . '
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 11]: In the evening I went to my uncle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 11]: He was sitting by his fire reading the New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 22]: ` Please , uncle , ' I said , ` will you tell me something about my father and mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 45]: ` With pleasure , my boy , ' he answered , and after a moment 's thought began to give me a sketch of my father 's life , with as many touches of the man himself as he could at the moment recall .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 10]: I will not detain my reader with the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 26]: It is sufficient to say that my father was a simple honourable man , without much education , but a great lover of plain books .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 38]: His health had always been delicate ; and before he died he had been so long an invalid that my mother 's health had given way in nursing him , so that she very soon followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 35]: As his narrative closed my uncle said : ` Now , Willie , you see , with a good man like that for your father , you are bound to be good and honourable !
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 17]: Never mind whether people praise you or not ; you do what you ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 10]: And do n't be always thinking of your rights .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 18]: There are people who consider themselves very grand because they ca n't bear to be interfered with .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 18]: They think themselves lovers of justice , when it is only justice to themselves they care about .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 21]: The true lover of justice is one who would rather die a slave than interfere with the rights of others .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: To wrong any one is the most terrible thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 17]: Injustice _ to _ you is not an awful thing like injustice _ in _ you .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 12]: I should like to see you a great man , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 12]: Do you know what I mean by a great man ? '
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 18]: ` Something else than I know , I 'm afraid , uncle , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 32]: A great man is one who will try to do right against the devil himself : one who will not do wrong to please anybody or to save his life . '
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 21]: I listened , but I thought with myself a man might do all that , and be no great man .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 26]: I would do something better -- some fine deed or other -- I did not know what now , but I should find out by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 16]: My uncle was too easily pleased : I should demand more of a great man .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 11]: Not so did the knights of old gain their renown .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 5]: I was silent . '
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 22]: I do n't want you to take my opinions as yours , you know , Willie , ' my uncle resumed .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 13]: ` But I want you to remember what my opinion is . '
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 24]: As he spoke , he went to a drawer in the room , and brought out something which he put in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 7]: I could hardly believe my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: It was the watch grannie had given me .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 14]: ` There , ' he said , ` is your father 's watch .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 16]: Let it keep you in mind that to be good is to be great . '
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 9]: ` Oh , thank you , uncle ! '
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 9]: I said , heeding only my recovered treasure .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 12]: ` But did n't it belong to somebody before my father ?
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 12]: Grannie gave it me as if it had been hers . '
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 19]: ` Your grandfather gave it to your father ; but when he died , your great-grandmother took it .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 9]: Did she tell you anything about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 4]: ` Nothing particular .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 9]: She said it was her husband 's . '
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 9]: ` So it was , I believe . '
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 10]: ` She used to call him my father . '
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 8]: ` Ah , you remember that ! '
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 15]: ` I 've had so much time to think about things , uncle ! '
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 13]: Well -- I hope you will think more about things yet . '
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 5]: ` Yes , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 14]: But there 's something else I should like to ask you about . '
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 6]: ` The old sword . '
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 13]: My uncle smiled , and rose again , saying , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 5]: I thought as much .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: Is that anything like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 12]: he added , bringing it from the bottom of a cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 9]: I took it from his hands with awe .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 5]: It was the same .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 16]: If I could have mistaken the hilt , I could not mistake the split sheath .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 6]: ` Oh , uncle ! '
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 7]: I exclaimed , breathless with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 10]: ` That 's it -- is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 7]: he said , enjoying my enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 7]: ` Yes , that it is !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 10]: Now tell me all about it , please . '
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 9]: ` Indeed I can tell you very little .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 9]: Some ancestor of ours fought with it somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 13]: There was a story about it , but I have forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 9]: You may have it if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 5]: ` No , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 3]: May I ?
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 7]: To take away with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 16]: I think you are old enough now not to do any mischief with it . '
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 14]: I do not believe there was a happier boy in England that night .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 9]: I did not mind where I went now .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 12]: I thought I could even bear to bid Mrs Elder farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 15]: Whether therefore possession had done me good , I leave my reader to judge .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 29]: But happily for our blessedness , the joy of possession soon palls , and not many days had gone by before I found I had a heart yet .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 12]: Strange to say , it was my aunt who touched it .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 44]: I do not yet know all the reasons which brought my uncle to the resolution of sending me abroad : it was certainly an unusual mode of preparing one for the university ; but the next day he disclosed the plan to me .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 7]: I was pleased with the notion .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: But my aunt 's apron went up to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 17]: It was a very hard apron , and I pitied those eyes although they were fierce .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 6]: ` Oh , auntie ! '
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 10]: I said , ` what are you crying for ?
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 9]: Do n't you like me to go ? '
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 9]: ` It 's too far off , child .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 15]: How am I to get to you if you should be taken ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 21]: Moved both by my own pleasure and her grief , I got up and threw my arms round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 7]: I had never done so before .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: She returned my embrace and wept freely .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 44]: As it was not a fit season for travelling , and as my uncle had not yet learned whither it would be well to send me , it was after all resolved that I should return to Mr Elder 's for another half-year .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 29]: This gave me unspeakable pleasure ; and I set out for school again in such a blissful mood as must be rare in the experience of any life .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 3]: THE HOUSE-STEWARD .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 31]: My uncle had had the watch cleaned and repaired for me , so that , notwithstanding its great age , it was yet capable of a doubtful sort of service .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 45]: Its caprices were almost human , but they never impaired the credit of its possession in the eyes of my school-fellows ; rather they added to the interest of the little machine , inasmuch as no one could foretell its behaviour under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 15]: We were far oftener late now , when we went out for a ramble .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 38]: Heretofore we had used our faculties and consulted the sky -- now we trusted to the watch , and indeed acted as if it could regulate the time to our convenience , and carry us home afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 22]: We regarded it , in respect Of time , very much as some people regard the Bible in respect of eternity .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 6]: And the consequences were similar .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 16]: We made an idol of it , and the idol played us the usual idol-pranks .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 33]: But I think the possession of the sword , in my own eyes too a far grander thing than the watch , raised me yet higher in the regard of my companions .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 21]: We could not be on such intimate terms with the sword , for one thing , as with the watch .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 21]: It was in more senses than one beyond our sphere -- a thing to be regarded with awe and reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 43]: Mr Elder had most wisely made no objection to my having it in our bed-room ; but he drove two nails into the wall and hung it high above my reach , saying the time had not come for my handling it .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 27]: I believe the good man respected the ancient weapon , and wished to preserve it from such usage as it might have met with from boys .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 48]: It was the more a constant stimulus to my imagination , and I believe insensibly to my moral nature as well , connecting me in a kind of dim consciousness with foregone ancestors who had , I took it for granted , done well on the battle-field .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 17]: I had the sense of an inherited character to sustain in the new order of things .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 28]: But there was more in its influence which I can hardly define -- the inheritance of it even gave birth to a certain sense of personal dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 41]: Although I never thought of visiting Moldwarp Hall again without an invitation , I took my companions more than once into the woods which lay about it : thus far I used the right of my acquaintance with the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 16]: One day in Spring , I had gone with them to the old narrow bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 8]: I was particularly fond of visiting it .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 73]: We lingered a long time about Queen Elizabeth 's oak ; and by climbing up on each other 's shoulders , and so gaining some stumps of vanished boughs , had succeeded in clambering , one after another , into the wilderness of its branches , where the young buds were now pushing away the withered leaves before them , as the young generations of men push the older into the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 20]: When my turn came , I climbed and climbed until I had reached a great height in its top .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 20]: Then I sat down , holding by the branch over my head , and began to look about me .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 22]: Below was an entangled net , as it seemed -- a labyrinth of boughs , branches , twigs , and shoots .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 12]: If I had fallen I could hardly have reached the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 54]: Through this environing mass of lines , I caught glimpses of the country around -- green fields , swelling into hills , where the fresh foliage was bursting from the trees ; and below , the little stream was pursuing its busy way by a devious but certain path to its unknown future .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 31]: Then my eyes turned to the tree-clad ascent on the opposite side : through the topmost of its trees , shone a golden spark , a glimmer of yellow fire .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 12]: It was the vane on the highest tower of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 14]: A great desire seized me to look on the lordly pile once more .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 26]: I descended in haste , and proposed to my companions that we should climb through the woods , and have a peep at the house .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 30]: The eldest , who was in a measure in charge of us -- his name was Bardsley , for Fox was gone -- proposed to consult my watch first .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 36]: Had we known that the faithless thing had stopped for an hour and a half , and then resumed its onward course as if nothing had happened , we should not have delayed our return .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 29]: As it was , off we scampered for the pack-horse bridge , which we left behind us only after many frog-leaps over the obstructing stones at the ends .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 27]: Then up through the wood we went like wild creatures , abstaining however from all shouting and mischief , aware that we were on sufferance only .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 25]: At length we stood on the verge of the descent , when to our surprise we saw the sun getting low in the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 22]: Clouds were gathering overhead , and a wailful wind made one moaning sweep through the trees behind us in the hollow .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 26]: The sun had hidden his shape , but not his splendour , in the skirts of the white clouds which were closing in around him .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 14]: Spring as it was , I thought I smelled snow in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 22]: But the vane which had drawn me shone brilliant against a darkening cloud , like a golden bird in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 24]: We looked at each other , not in dismay exactly , but with a common feeling that the elements were gathering against us .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 25]: The wise way would of course have been to turn at once and make for home ; but the watch had to be considered .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 11]: Was the watch right , or was the watch wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: Its health and conduct were of the greatest interest to the commonweal .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: That question must be answered .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 18]: We looked from the watch to the sun , and back from the sun to the watch .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 36]: Steady to all appearance as the descending sun itself , the hands were trotting and crawling along their appointed way , with a look of unconscious innocence , in the midst of their diamond coronet .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 38]: I volunteered to settle the question : I would run to the Hall , ring the bell , and ask leave to go as far into the court as to see the clock on the central tower .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 5]: The proposition was applauded .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 17]: I ran , rang , and being recognized by the portress , was at once admitted .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 36]: In a moment I had satisfied myself of the treachery of my bosom-friend , and was turning to leave the court , when a lattice opened , and I heard a voice calling my name .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 6]: It was Mrs Wilson 's .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 4]: She beckoned me .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 7]: I went up under the window .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: ` Why do n't you come and see me , Master Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 10]: ` You did n't ask me , Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 10]: I should have liked to come very much . '
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 14]: ` Come in , then , and have tea with me now . '
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 10]: ` No , thank you , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 15]: ` My schoolfellows are waiting for me , and we are too late already .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 9]: I only came to see the clock . '
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 12]: ` Well , you must come soon , then . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 6]: I will , Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 39]: Good-night , ' I answered , and away I ran , opened the wicket for myself , set my foot in the deep shoe-mould , then rushed down the rough steps and across the grass to my companions .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 33]: When they heard what time it was , they turned without a word , and in less than a minute we were at the bottom of the hill and over the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 14]: The wood followed us with a moan which was gathering to a roar .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 9]: Down in the meadow it was growing dark .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 29]: Before we reached the lodge , it had begun to rain , and the wind , when we got out upon the road , was blowing a gale .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 7]: We were seven miles from home .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 33]: Happily the wind was in our back , and , wet to the skin , but not so weary because of the aid of the wind , we at length reached Aldwick .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 34]: The sole punishment we had for being so late -- and that was more a precaution than a punishment -- was that we had to go to bed immediately after a hurried tea .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 41]: To face and fight the elements is , however , an invaluable lesson in childhood , and I do not think those parents do well who are over-careful to preserve all their children from all inclemencies of weather or season .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 19]: When the next holiday drew near , I once more requested and obtained permission to visit Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 27]: I am now puzzled to understand why my uncle had not interdicted it , but certainly he had laid no injunctions upon me in regard thereto .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: Possibly he had communicated with Mrs Wilson : I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 16]: If he had requested Mr. Elder to prevent me , I could not have gone .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 44]: So far , however , must this have been from being the case that , on the eve of the holiday , Mr Elder said to me : ` If Mrs Wilson should ask you to stay all night , you may . '
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 12]: I suspect he knew more about some things than I did .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 17]: The notion of staying all night seemed to me , however , out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 13]: Mrs Wilson could not be expected to entertain me to that extent .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 14]: I fancy , though , that she had written to make the request .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 15]: My schoolfellows accompanied me as far as the bridge , and there left me .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 47]: Mrs Wilson received me with notable warmth , and did propose that I should stay all night , to which I gladly agreed , more , it must be confessed , from the attraction of the old house than the love I bore to Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 10]: ` But what is that you are carrying ? '
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 5]: It was my sword .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 6]: This requires a little explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 41]: It was natural enough that on the eve of a second visit , as I hoped , to the armoury , I should , on going up to bed , lift my eyes with longing look to my own sword .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 21]: The thought followed -- what a pleasure it would be to compare it with the other swords in the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 14]: If I could only get it down and smuggle it away with me !
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 5]: It was my own .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 50]: I believed Mr Elder would not approve of this , but at the same time he had never told me not to take it down : he had only hung it too high for any of us to reach it -- almost close to the ceiling , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 19]: But a want of enterprise was not then a fault of mine , and the temptation was great .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 36]: So , when my chum was asleep , I rose , and by the remnant of a fading moon got together the furniture -- no easy undertaking when the least noise would have betrayed me .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 31]: Fortunately there was a chest of drawers not far from under the object of my ambition , and I managed by half inches to move it the few feet necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 22]: On the top of this I hoisted the small dressing-table , which , being only of deal , was very light .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 16]: The chest of drawers was large enough to hold my small box beside the table .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 32]: I got on the drawers by means of a chair , then by means of the box I got on the table , and so succeeded in getting down the sword .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 19]: Having replaced the furniture , I laid the weapon under my bolster , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 31]: The moment I woke I got up , and before the house was stirring had deposited the sword in an outbuilding whence I could easily get it off the premises .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 14]: Of course my companions knew , and I told them all my design .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 21]: Moberly hinted that I ought to have asked Mr Elder , but his was the sole remark in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 13]: ` It is my sword , Mrs Wilson , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 11]: ` How do you come to have a sword ? '
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 11]: ` It is hardly a fit plaything for you . '
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 34]: I told her how it had been in the house since long before I was born , and that I had brought it to compare with some of the swords in the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 9]: ` Very well , ' she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 26]: I dare say we can manage it ; but when Mr Close is at home it is not very easy to get into the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 14]: He 's so jealous of any one touching his swords and guns ! '
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 9]: ` Who is Mr Close , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 8]: ` Mr Close is the house-steward . '
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 13]: ` But they 're not his , then , are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 10]: ` It 's quite enough that he thinks so .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: He has a fancy for that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 17]: I 'm sure I do n't see anything so precious in the rusty old rubbish . '
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 21]: I suspected that , as the saying is , there was no love lost between Mrs Wilson and Mr Close .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 29]: I learned afterwards that he had been chaplain to a regiment of foot , which , according to rumour , he had had to leave for some misconduct .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 45]: This was in the time of the previous owner of Moldwarp Hall , and nobody now knew the circumstances under which he had become house-steward -- a position in which Sir Giles , when he came to the property , had retained his services .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 21]: ` We are going to have company , and a dance , this evening , ' continued Mrs Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 16]: I hardly know what to do with you , my hands are so full . '
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 43]: This was not very consistent with her inviting me to stay all night , and confirms my suspicion that she had made a request to that purport of Mr. Elder , for otherwise , surely , she would have sent me home .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 11]: never mind me , Mrs Wilson , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 18]: ` If you will let me wander about the place , I shall be perfectly comfortable . '
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 22]: ` Yes ; but you might get in the way of the family , or the visitors , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 13]: ` I 'll take good care of that , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 16]: ` Surely there is room in this huge place without running against any one . '
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 10]: ` There ought to be , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: After a few minutes ' silence , she resumed .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 26]: ` We shall have a good many of them staying all night ' , but there will be room for you , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 16]: What would you like to do with yourself till they begin to come ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 25]: I should like to go to the library , ' I answered , thinking , I confess , of the adjacent armoury as well .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 10]: ` Should I be in the way there ? '
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 16]: ` No ; I do n't think you would , ' she replied , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 11]: ` It 's not often any one goes there . '
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 9]: ` Who takes charge of the books ? '
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 14]: books do n't want much taking care of , ' she replied . '
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 21]: I have thought of having them down and dusting the place out , but it would be such a job !
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 10]: and the dust do n't signify upon old books .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 10]: They ai n't of much count in this house .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 6]: Nobody heeds them . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 34]: I wish Sir Giles would let me come and put them in order in the holidays , ' I said , little knowing how altogether unfit I yet was for such an undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 4]: ` Ah well !
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 4]: we 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 4]: Who knows ? '
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 9]: ` You do n't think he would ! '
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 4]: I exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 4]: Perhaps he might .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 10]: But I thought you were going abroad soon . '
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 11]: I had not said anything to her on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 7]: I had never had an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 10]: ` Who told you that , Mrs Wilson ? '
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 5]: ` Never you mind .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 4]: A little bird .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 9]: Now you had better go to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 35]: I dare say you wo n't hurt anything , for Sir Giles , although he never looks at the books , would be dreadfully angry if he thought anything were happening to them . '
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 17]: ` I 'll take as good care of them as if they were my uncle 's .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 13]: He used to let me handle his as much as I liked .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 9]: I used to mend them up for him .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 15]: I 'm quite accustomed to books , I assure you , Mrs Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 17]: ` Come , then ; I will show you the way , ' she said . '
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 11]: I think I know the way , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 40]: For I had pondered so much over the place , and had , I presume , filled so many gaps of recollection with creations of fancy , that I quite believed I knew my way all about the house .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 13]: ` We shall see , ' she returned with a smile . '
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 22]: I will take you the nearest way , and you shall tell me on your honour if you remember it . '
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 9]: She led the way , and I followed .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 30]: Passing down the stone stair and through several rooms , mostly plain bedrooms , we arrived at a wooden staircase , of which there were few in the place .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 64]: We ascended a little way , crossed one or two rooms more , came out on a small gallery open to the air , a sort of covered bridge across a gulf in the building , re-entered , and after crossing other rooms , tapestried , and to my eyes richly furnished , arrived at the first of those occupied by the library .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 11]: ` Now did you know the way , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 11]: ` Not in the least , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 13]: I can not think how I could have forgotten it so entirely .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 7]: I am ashamed of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 10]: ` You have no occasion , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 10]: ` You never went that way at all . '
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 7]: ` Oh , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 10]: I said ; ` what a place it is !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 11]: I might lose myself in it for a week . '
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 18]: ` You would come out somewhere , if you went on long enough , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 14]: But you must not leave the library till I come and fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 9]: You will want some dinner before long . '
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 8]: ` What time do you dine ? '
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 10]: I asked , putting my hand to my watch-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 9]: you 've got a watch -- have you ?
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 15]: But indeed , on a day like this , I dine when I can .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 5]: You need n't fear .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 8]: I will take care of you . '
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 10]: ` May n't I go into the armoury ? '
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 13]: ` If you do n't mind the risk of meeting Mr Close .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 11]: But he 's not likely to be there to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 15]: She left me with fresh injunctions not to stir till she came for me .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 42]: But I now felt the place to be so like a rabbit-warren , that I dared not leave the library , if not for the fear of being lost , then for the fear of intruding upon some of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 20]: I soon nestled in a corner , with books behind , books before , and books all around me .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 60]: After trying several spots , like a miner searching for live lodes , and finding nothing auriferous to my limited capacities and tastes , I at length struck upon a rich vein , instantly dropped on the floor , and , with my back against the shelves , was now immersed in ` The Seven Champions of Christendom . '
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 24]: As I read , a ray of light , which had been creeping along the shelves behind me , leaped upon my page .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 4]: I looked up .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 10]: I had not yet seen the room so light .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 20]: Nor had I perceived before in what confusion and with what disrespect the books were heaped upon the shelves .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 45]: A dim feeling awoke in me that to restore such a world to order would be like a work of creation ; but I sank again forthwith in the delights of a feast provided for an imagination which had in general to feed itself .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 14]: I had here all the delight of invention without any of its effort .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 9]: At length I became aware of some weariness .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 16]: The sunbeam had vanished , not only from the page , but from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 7]: I began to stretch my arms .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 29]: As the tension of their muscles relaxed , my hand fell upon the sword which I had carried with me and laid on the floor by my side .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 6]: It awoke another mental nerve .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 8]: I would go and see the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 20]: I rose , and wandered slowly through room after room of the library , dragging my sword after me .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 38]: When I reached the last , there , in the corner next the outer wall of the house , rose the three stone steps leading to the little door that communicated with the treasury of ancient strife .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 37]: I stood at the foot of the steps irresolute for a moment , fearful lest my black man , Mr Close , should be within , polishing his weapons perhaps , and fearful in his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 26]: I ascended the steps , listened at the door , heard nothing , lifted the old , quaintly-formed latch , peeped in , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 15]: There was the whole collection , abandoned to my eager gaze and eager hands !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 42]: How long I stood , taking down weapon after weapon , examining each like an old book , speculating upon modes of use , and intention of varieties in form , poring over adornment and mounting , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 51]: Historically the whole was a sealed book ; individually I made a thorough acquaintance with not a few , noting the differences and resemblances between them and my own , and instead of losing conceit of the latter , finding more and more reasons for holding it dear and honourable .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 95]: I was poising in one hand , with the blade upright in the air -- for otherwise I could scarcely have held it in both -- a huge two-handed , double-hilted sword with serrated double edge , when I heard a step approaching , and before I had well replaced the sword , a little door in a corner which-I had scarcely noticed -- the third door to the room -- opened , and down the last steps of the narrowest of winding stairs a little man in black screwed himself into the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 9]: I was startled , but not altogether frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 33]: I felt myself grasping my own sword somewhat nervously in my left hand , as I abandoned the great one , and let it fall back with a clang into its corner .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 6]: ` By the powers ! '
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 25]: exclaimed Mr Close , revealing himself an Irishman at once in the surprise of my presence , ` and whom have we here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 21]: I felt my voice tremble a little as I replied , ` Mrs Wilson allowed me to come , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: I assure you I have not been hurting anything . '
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 7]: ` Who 's to tell that ?
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 12]: Mrs Wilson has no business to let any one come here .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 5]: This is my quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 11]: There -- you 've got one in your hand now !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 13]: You 've left finger-marks on the blade , I 'll be bound .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 5]: Give it me . '
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 6]: He stretched out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 4]: I drew back .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 10]: ` This one is mine , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 8]: ` Ho , ho , young gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 9]: So you 're a collector -- are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 3]: Already too !
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 6]: Nothing like beginning in time .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 10]: Let me look at the thing , though . '
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 25]: He was a little man , as I have said , dressed in black , with a frock coat and a deep white neckcloth .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 43]: His face would have been vulgar , especially as his nose was a traitor to his mouth , revealing in its hue the proclivities of its owner , but for a certain look of the connoisseur which went far to redeem it .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 22]: The hand which he stretched out to take my weapon , was small and delicate -- like a woman 's indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 8]: His speech was that of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 8]: I handed him the sword at once .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 15]: He had scarcely glanced at it when a strange look passed over his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 19]: He tried to draw it , failed , and looking all along the sheath , saw its condition .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 5]: Then his eyes flashed .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 15]: He turned from me abruptly , and went up the stair he had descended .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 23]: I waited anxiously for what seemed to me half an hour : I dare say it was not more than ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 14]: At last I heard him revolving on his axis down the corkscrew staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 13]: He entered and handed me my sword , saying -- ` There !
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 10]: I ca n't get it out of the sheath .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 9]: It 's in a horrid state of rust .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 9]: Where did you fall in with it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 9]: I told him all I knew about it .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 15]: If he did not seem exactly interested , he certainly behaved with some oddity .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 54]: When I told him what my grandmother had said about some battle in which an ancestor had worn it , his arm rose with a jerk , and the motions of his face , especially of his mouth , which appeared to be eating its own teeth , were for a moment grotesque .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 32]: When I had finished , he said , with indifferent tone , but eager face -- ` Well , it 's a rusty old thing , but I like old weapons .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 23]: I 'll give you a bran new officer 's sword , as bright as a mirror , for it -- I will .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 3]: There now !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 7]: Is it a bargain ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 22]: I could not part with it , sir -- not for the best sword in the country , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 13]: ` You see it has been so long in our family . '
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 3]: ` Hm !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 2]: hm !
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 8]: you 're quite right , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 8]: I would n't if I were you .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 30]: But as I see you know how to set a right value on such a weapon , you may stay and look at mine as long as you like .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 23]: Only if you take any of them from their sheaths , you must be very careful how you put them in again .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 6]: Do n't use any force .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 25]: If there is any one you ca n't manage easily , just lay it on the window-sill , and I will attend to it .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 15]: Mind you do n't handle -- I mean touch -- the blades at all .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 11]: There would be no end of rust-spots before morning . '
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 14]: I was full of gratitude for the confidence he placed in me . '
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 20]: I ca n't stop now to tell you about them all , but I will -- some day . '
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 19]: So saying he disappeared once more up the little staircase , leaving me like Aladdin in the jewel-forest .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 73]: I had not been alone more than half an hour or so , however , when he returned , and taking down a dagger , said abruptly , ` There , that is the dagger with which Lord Harry Rolleston ' -- I think that was the name , but knowing nothing of the family or its history , I could not keep the names separate -- ` stabbed his brother Gilbert .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 39]: And there is -- ' He took down one after another , and with every one he associated some fact -- or fancy perhaps , for I suspect now that he invented not a few of his incidents .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 16]: ` They have always been fond of weapons in this house , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 10]: ` There now is one with the strangest story !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 17]: It 's in print -- I can show it you in print in the library there .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 19]: It had the reputation of being a magic sword -- ' ` Like King Arthur 's Excalibur ? '
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 17]: I asked , for I had read a good deal of the history of Prince Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' said Mr Close .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 19]: ` Well , that sword had been in the family for many years -- I may say centuries .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 12]: One day it disappeared , and there was a great outcry .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 20]: A lackey had been discharged for some cause or other , and it was believed he had taken it .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: But before they found him , the sword was in its place upon the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 22]: Afterwards the man confessed that he had taken it , out of revenge , for he knew how it was prized .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 39]: But in the middle of the next night , as he slept in a roadside inn , a figure dressed in ancient armour had entered the room , taken up the sword , and gone away with it .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 8]: I dare say it was all nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 26]: His heart had failed him when he found he was followed , and he had contrived by the help of some fellow-servant to restore it .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 14]: But there are very queer stories about old weapons -- swords in particular .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 28]: I must go now , ' he concluded , ` for we have company to-night , and I have a good many things to see to . '
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 6]: So saying he left me .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 38]: I remained a long time in the armoury , and then returned to the library , where I seated myself in the same corner as before , and went on with my reading -- lost in pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 19]: All at once I became aware that the light was thickening , and that I was very hungry .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 27]: At the same moment I heard a slight rustle in the room , and looked round , expecting to see Mrs Wilson come to fetch me .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 20]: But there stood Miss Clara -- not now in white , however , but in a black silk frock .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 15]: She had grown since I saw her last , and was prettier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 7]: She started when she saw me .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 5]: ` You here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 14]: she exclaimed , as if we had known each other all our lives .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: ` What are you doing here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 21]: ` Reading , ' I answered , and rose from the floor , replacing the book as I rose . '
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 12]: I thought you were Mrs Wilson come to fetch me . '
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 7]: ` Is she coming here ? '
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 15]: She told me not to leave the library till she came for me . '
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 11]: ` Then I must get out of the way . '
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 8]: ` Why so , Miss Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 11]: I do n't mean her to know I am here .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 40]: If you tell , I shall think you the meanest -- ' ` Do n't trouble yourself to find your punishment before you 've found your crime , ' I said , thinking of my own processes of invention .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 9]: What a little prig I must have been !
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 18]: ` Very well , I will trust you , ' she returned , holding out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 39]: -- ' I did n't give it you to keep , though , ' she added , finding that , with more of country manners than tenderness , I fear , I retained it in my boyish grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 11]: I felt awkward at once , and let it go .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 8]: ` Thank you , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 12]: ` Now , when do you expect Mrs. Wilson ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 7]: I do n't know at all .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 9]: She said she would fetch me for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 9]: There she comes , I do believe . '
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 34]: Clara turned her head like a startled forest creature that wants to listen , but does not know in what direction , and moved her feet as if she were about to fly .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 16]: ` Come back after dinner , ' she said : ` you had better ! '
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 33]: and darting to the other side of the room , lifted a piece of hanging tapestry , and vanished just in time , for Mrs Wilson 's first words crossed her last .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 26]: ` My dear boy -- Master Cumbermede , I should say , I am sorry I have not been able to get to you sooner .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 17]: One thing after another has kept me on my legs till I 'm ready to drop .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 11]: The cook is as tiresome as cooks only can be .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 33]: But come along ; I 've got a mouthful of dinner for you at last , and a few minutes to eat my share of it with you , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 42]: I followed without a word , feeling a little guilty , but only towards Mrs Wilson , not towards myself , if my reader will acknowledge the difference -- for I did not feel that I ought to betray Miss Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 24]: We returned as we came ; and certainly whatever temper the cook might be in , there was nothing amiss with the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 17]: Had there been , however , I was far too hungry to find fault with it .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 12]: ` Well , how have you enjoyed yourself , Master Wilfrid ?
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 8]: Not very much , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 14]: But really I could not help it , ' said Mrs Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 12]: I could n't have enjoyed myself more , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 24]: ` If you will allow me , I 'll go back to the library as soon as I 've done my dinner . '
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 10]: ` But it 's almost dark there now . '
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 16]: ` You would n't mind letting me have a candle , Mrs Wilson ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 5]: A candle , child !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: It would be of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 11]: The place would n't light up with twenty candles . '
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 10]: ` But I do n't want it lighted up .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 13]: I could read by one candle as well as by twenty . '
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 4]: ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 7]: You shall do as you like .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 37]: Only be careful , for the old house is as dry as tinder , and if you were to set fire to anything , we should be all in a blaze in a moment . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 8]: I will be careful , Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 5]: You may trust me .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: Indeed you may . '
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 9]: She hurried me a little over my dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 8]: The bell in the court rang loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 8]: ` There 's some of them already !
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 6]: That must be the Simmonses .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 45]: They 're always early , and they always come to that gate -- I suppose because they have n't a carriage of their own , and do n't like to drive into the high court in a chaise from the George and Pudding . '
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 14]: ` I 've quite done , ma'am : may I go now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 10]: ` Wait till I get you a candle . '
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 43]: She took one from a press in the room , lighted it , led me once more to the library , and there left me with a fresh injunction not to be peeping out and getting in the way of the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 3]: THE LEADS .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 37]: The moment Mrs Wilson was gone , I expected to see Clara peep out from behind the tapestry in the corner ; but as she did not appear , I lifted it , and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 24]: There was nothing behind but a closet almost filled with books , not upon shelves , but heaped up from floor to ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 21]: There had been just room , and no more , for Clara to stand between the tapestry and the books .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 37]: It was of no use attempting to look for her -- at least I said so to myself , for as yet the attraction of an old book was equal to that of a young girl .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 13]: Besides , I always enjoyed waiting -- up to a certain point .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 26]: Therefore I resumed my place on the floor , with the _ Seven Champions _ in one hand , and my chamber-candlestick in the other .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 27]: I had for the moment forgotten Clara in the adventures of St. Andrew of Scotland , when the _ silking _ of her frock aroused me .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: She was at my side .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 9]: ` Well , you 've had your dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 8]: Did she give you any dessert ? '
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 15]: ` This is my dessert , ' I said , holding up the book .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 29]: ` It 's far more than -- ' ` Far more than your desert , ' she pursued , ` if you prefer it to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 11]: I looked for you first , ' I said defensively .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 4]: ` Where ? '
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 7]: ` In the closet there . '
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 15]: ` You did n't think I was going to wait there , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 14]: Why the very spiders are hanging dead in their own webs in there .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 32]: But here 's some dessert for you -- if you 're as fond of apples as most boys , ' she added , taking a small rosy-cheeked beauty from her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 18]: I accepted it , but somehow did not quite relish being lumped with boys in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 36]: As I ate it , which I should have felt bound to do even had it been less acceptable in itself , she resumed -- ` Would n't you like to see the company arrive ?
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: That 's what I came for .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 10]: I was n't going to ask Goody Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 28]: ` Yes , I should , ' I answered ; ` but Mrs Wilson told me to keep here , and not get in their way . '
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 7]: I 'll take care of that .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 7]: We sha n't go near them .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 16]: I know every corner of the place -- a good deal better than Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 15]: Come along , Wilfrid -- that 's your name , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 6]: ` Yes , it is .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 8]: Am I to call you Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 15]: ` Yes , if you are good -- that is , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 9]: I do n't care what you call me .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 4]: Come along . '
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 3]: I followed .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 7]: She led me into the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 15]: A great clang of the bell in the paved court fell upon our ears .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 21]: ` Make haste , ' she said , and darted to the door at the foot of the little stair .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 11]: ` Mind how you go , ' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 8]: ` The steps are very much worn .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 7]: Keep your right shoulder foremost . '
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 12]: I obeyed her directions , and followed her up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 35]: We passed the door of a room over the armoury , and ascended still , to creep out at last through a very low door on to the leads of the little square tower .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 65]: Here we could on the one side look into every corner of the paved court , and on the other , across the roof of the hall , could see about half of the high court , as they called it , into which the carriages drove ; and from this post of vantage , we watched the arrival of a good many parties .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 62]: I thought the ladies tripping across the paved court , with their gay dresses lighting up the Spring twilight , and their sweet voices rippling its almost pensive silence , suited the time and the place much better than the carriages dashing into the other court , fine as they looked with their well-kept horses and their servants in gay liveries .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 33]: The sun was down , and the moon was rising -- near the full , but there was too much light in the sky to let her make much of herself yet .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 38]: It was one of those Spring evenings which you could not tell from an Autumn one except for a certain something in the air appealing to an undefined sense -- rather that of smell than any other .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 34]: There were green buds and not withering leaves in it -- life and not death ; and the voices of the gathering guests were of the season , and pleasant to the soul .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 22]: Of course Nature did not then affect me so definitely as to make me give forms of thought to her influences .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 13]: It is now first that I turn them into shapes and words .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 20]: As we stood , I discovered that I had been a little mistaken about the position of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 41]: I saw that , although from some points in front it seemed to stand on an isolated rock , the ground rose behind it , terrace upon terrace , the uppermost of which terraces were crowned with rows of trees .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 11]: Over them , the moon was now gathering her strength .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 32]: ` It is rather cold ; I think we had better go in , ' said Clara , after we had remained there for some minutes without seeing any fresh arrivals .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 8]: ` Very well , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 6]: ` What shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 6]: Shall you go home ? '
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 6]: ` No , certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 13]: We must see a good deal more of the fun first . '
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 7]: ` How will you manage that ?
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: You will go to the ball-room , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 11]: You can go where you please , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 4]: ` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 9]: I 'm not grand enough to be invited .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 5]: Oh , dear no !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 9]: At least I am not old enough . '
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 10]: ` But you will be some day . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 2]: Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 4]: We 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: Meantime we must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 11]: What are _ you _ going to do ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 9]: I shall go back to the library . '
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 29]: ` Then I 'll go with you -- till the music begins ; and then I 'll take you where you can see a little of the dancing .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: It 's great fun . '
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 9]: ` But how will you manage that ? '
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 8]: ` You leave that to me . '
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 23]: We descended at once to the armoury , where I had left my candle ; and thence we returned to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 11]: ` Would you like me to read to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 13]: I do n't mind -- if it 's anything worth hearing . '
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 21]: ` Well , I 'll read you a bit of the book I was reading when you came in . '
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 5]: that musty old book !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 5]: No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 17]: It 's enough to give one the horrors -- the very sight of it is enough .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 10]: How can you like such frumpy old things ? '
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: you must n't mind the look of it , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 11]: ` It 's _ very _ nice inside ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 13]: I know where there is a nice one , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 7]: ` Give me the candle . '
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 16]: I followed her to another of the rooms , where she searched for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 9]: At length -- ` There it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: she said , and put into my hand _ The Castle of Otranto _ .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 5]: The name promised well .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 56]: She next led the way to a lovely little bay window , forming almost a closet , which looked out upon the park , whence , without seeing the moon , we could see her light on the landscape , and the great deep shadows cast over the park from the towers of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 14]: There we sat on the broad window-sill , and I began to read .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 4]: It was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 22]: Does it indicate loss of power , that the grown man can not enjoy the book in which the boy delighted ?
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 29]: Or is it that the realities of the book , as perceived by his keener eyes , refuse to blend with what imagination would supply if it might ?
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 24]: No sooner however did the first notes of the distant violins enter the ear of my companion than she started to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: I asked , looking up from the book .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 9]: ` Do n't you hear the music ? '
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 6]: she said , half-indignantly . '
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 15]: I hear it now , ' I answered ; ` but why -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 10]: ` Come along , ' she interrupted , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 19]: ` We shall just be in time to see them go across from the drawing-room to the ball-room .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 4]: Come , come .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 5]: Leave your candle . '
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 9]: I put down my book with some reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 30]: She led me into the armoury , and from the armoury out on the gallery half-encompassing the great hall , which was lighted up , and full of servants .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 63]: Opening another door in the gallery , she conducted me down a stair which led almost into the hall , but , ascending again behind it , landed us in a little lobby , on one side of which was the drawing-room , and on the other the ball-room , on another level , reached by a few high , semi-circular steps .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 3]: ` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 3]: quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 19]: said Clara , and turning sharply round , she opened another door , disclosing a square-built stone staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: She pushed the door carefully against the wall , ran up a few steps , I following in some trepidation , turned abruptly , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 18]: I did as she did , questioning nothing : I had committed myself to her superior knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 41]: The quick ear of my companion had caught the first sounds of the tuning of the instruments , and here we were , before the invitation to dance , a customed observance at Moldwarp Hall , had begun to play .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 57]: In a few minutes thereafter , the door of the drawing-room opened ; when , pair after pair , the company , to the number of over a hundred and fifty , I should guess , walked past the foot of the stair on which we were seated , and ascended the steps into the ball-room .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 23]: The lobby was dimly lighted , except from the two open doors , and there was little danger of our being seen .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 73]: I interrupt my narrative to mention the odd fact that so fully was my mind possessed with the antiquity of the place , which it had been the pride of generation after generation to keep up , that now , when I recall the scene , the guests always appear dressed not as they were then , but in a far more antique style with which after knowledge supplied my inner vision .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 34]: Last of all came Lady Brotherton , Sir Giles 's wife , a pale , delicate-looking woman , leaning on the arm of a tall , long-necked , would-be-stately , yet insignificant-looking man .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 23]: She gave a shiver as , up the steps from the warm drawing-room , she came at once opposite our open door .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 9]: ` What a draught there is here ! '
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 11]: she said , adjusting her rose-coloured scarf about her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 6]: ` It feels quite wintry .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 13]: Will you oblige me , Mr Mellon , by shutting that door ?
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 12]: Sir Giles will not allow me to have it built up .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 15]: I am sure there are plenty of ways to the leads besides that . '
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 8]: ` This door , my lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 4]: asked Mr Mellon .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: I trembled lest he should see us .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 5]: Just throw it to .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 8]: There 's a spring lock on it .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 23]: I ca n't think -- ' The slam and echoing bang of the closing door cut off the end of the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 22]: Even Clara was a little frightened , for her hand stole into mine for a moment before she burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 3]: hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 8]: ` They will hear you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 10]: I almost wish they would , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 14]: ` What a goose I was to be frightened , and not speak !
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 8]: Do you know where we are ? '
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 12]: ` No , ' I answered ; ` how should I ?
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: Where are we ? '
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 13]: My fancy of knowing the place had vanished utterly by this time .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 28]: All my mental charts of it had got thoroughly confused , and I do not believe I could have even found my way back to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 11]: ` Shut out on the leads , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 4]: ` Come along .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 11]: We may as well go to meet our fate . '
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 33]: I confess to a little palpitation of the heart as she spoke , for I was not yet old enough to feel that Clara 's companionship made the doom a light one .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 21]: Up the stairs we went -- here no twisting corkscrew , but a broad flight enough , with square turnings .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 24]: At the top was a door , fastened only with a bolt inside -- against no worse housebreakers than the winds and rains .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 12]: When we emerged , we found ourselves in the open night .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 11]: ` Here we are in the moon 's drawing-room ! '
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: The scene was lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 17]: The sky was all now -- the earth only a background or pedestal for the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 39]: The river , far below , shone here and there in answer to the moon , while the meadows and fields lay as in the oblivion of sleep , and the wooded hills were only dark formless masses .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 33]: But the sky was the dwelling-place of the moon , before whose radiance , penetratingly still , the stars shrunk as if they would hide in the flowing skirts of her garments .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 20]: There was scarce a cloud to be seen , and the whiteness of the moon made the blue thin .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: I could hardly believe in what I saw .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 15]: It was as if I had come awake without getting out of the dream .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 9]: We were on the roof of the ball-room .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 19]: We felt the rhythmic motion of the dancing feet shake the building in time to the music . '
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 18]: A low melodious thunder ' buried beneath -- above , the eternal silence of the white moon !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 9]: We passed to the roof of the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 25]: From it , upon one side , we could peep into the great gothic window of the hall , which rose high above it .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 55]: We could see the servants passing and repassing , with dishes for the supper which was being laid in the dining-room under the drawing-room , for the hall was never used for entertainment now , except on such great occasions as a coming of age , or an election-feast , when all classes met .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: ` We must n't stop here , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 10]: ` We shall get our deaths of cold . '
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: ` What shall we do , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 25]: ` There are plenty of doors , ' she answered -- ` only Mrs Wilson has a foolish fancy for keeping them all bolted .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 7]: We must try , though . '
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 45]: Over roof after roof we went ; now descending , now ascending a few steps ; now walking along narrow gutters , between battlement and sloping roof ; now crossing awkward junctions -- trying doors many in tower and turret -- all in vain !
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 8]: Every one was bolted on the inside .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 12]: We had grown quite silent , for the case looked serious .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 18]: ` This is the last door , ' said Clara -- ` the last we can reach .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 13]: There are more in the towers , but they are higher up .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 7]: What _ shall _ we do ?
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 18]: Unless we go down a chimney , I do n't know what 's to be done . '
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 15]: Still her voice did not falter , and my courage did not give way .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 9]: She stood for a few moments , silent .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 14]: I stood regarding her , as one might listen for a doubtful oracle .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 6]: I 've got it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: ` Have you a good head , Wilfrid ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 13]: I do n't quite know what you mean , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 17]: ` Do you mind being on a narrow place , without much to hold by ? '
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 5]: ` High up ? '
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 6]: I asked with a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 8]: For a moment I did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 35]: It was a special weakness of my physical nature , one which my imagination had increased tenfold -- the absolute horror I had of such a transit as she was evidently about to propose .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 24]: My worst dreams -- from which I would wake with my heart going like a fire-engine -- were of adventures of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 11]: But before a woman , how could I draw back ?
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 12]: I would rather lie broken at the bottom of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 22]: And if the fear should come to the worst , I could at least throw myself down and end it so .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 17]: I said , as if I had only been waiting for her exposition of the case .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 7]: -- ` Come along then . '
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 24]: I did go along -- like a man to the gallows ; only I would not have turned back to save my life .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 32]: But I should have hailed the slightest change of purpose in her , with such pleasure as Daniel must have felt when he found the lions would rather not eat him .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 24]: She retraced our steps a long way -- until we reached the middle of the line of building which divided the two courts .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 59]: she said , pointing to the top of the square tower over the entrance to the hall , from which we had watched the arrival of the guests : it rose about nine feet only above where we now stood in the gutter -- ' I _ know _ I left the door open when we came down .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 6]: I did it on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 5]: I hate Goody Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 5]: Lucky , you see !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 9]: -- that is if you have a head .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: And if you have n't , it 's all the same : I have . '
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 52]: So saying , she pointed to a sort of flying buttress which sprung sideways , with a wide span , across the angle the tower made with the hall , from an embrasure of the battlement of the hall to the outer corner of the tower , itself more solidly buttressed .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 50]: I think it must have been made to resist the outward pressure of the roof of the hall ; but it was one of those puzzling points which often occur -- and oftenest in domestic architecture -- where additions and consequent alterations have been made from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 19]: Such will occasion sometimes as much conjecture towards their explanation as a disputed passage in Shakspere or Aeschylus .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 10]: Could she mean me to cross that hair-like bridge ?
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 7]: The mere thought was a terror .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 6]: But I would not blench .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 15]: Fear I confess -- cowardice if you will : -- poltroonery , not . '
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: I see , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 4]: I will try .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 9]: If I fall , do n't blame me .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 7]: I will do my best . '
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 20]: ` You do n't think , ' she returned , ` I 'm going to let you go alone !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 34]: I should have to wait hours before you found a door to let me down -- unless indeed you went and told Goody Wilson , and I had rather die where I am .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 7]: I 'll show you how . '
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 33]: With a rush and a scramble , she was up over the round back of the buttress before I had time to understand that she meant as usual to take the lead .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 36]: If she could but have sent me back a portion of her skill , or lightness , or nerve , or whatever it was , just to set me off with a rush like that !
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 9]: But I stood preparing at once and hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 11]: She turned and looked over the battlements of the tower .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 18]: ` Never mind , Wilfrid , ' she said ; ` I 'll fetch you presently . '
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' I cried .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 5]: ` Wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 5]: I 'm coming . '
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 14]: I got astride of the buttress , and painfully forced my way up .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 14]: It was like a dream of leap-frog , prolonged under painfully recurring difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 20]: I shut my eyes , and persuaded myself that all I had to do was to go on leap-frogging .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 58]: At length , after more trepidation and brain-turning than I care to dwell upon , lest even now it should bring back a too keen realization of itself , I reached the battlement , seizing which with one shaking hand , and finding the other grasped by Clara , I tumbled on the leads of the tower .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 5]: ` Come along ! '
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 21]: ` You see , when the girls like , they can beat the boys -- even at their own games .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 8]: We 're all right now . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 13]: I did my best , ' I returned , mightily relieved . '
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 11]: _ I 'm _ not an angel , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 8]: I ca n't fly like you . '
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 7]: She seemed to appreciate the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 4]: ` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 6]: I 've done it before .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 9]: It was game of you to follow . '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: Her praise elated me .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 5]: And it was well .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 8]: ` Come along , ' she added .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 11]: She seemed to be always saying _ Come along _ .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 9]: I obeyed , full of gratitude and relief .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 17]: She skipped to the tiny turret which rose above our heads , and lifted the door-latch .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 17]: But , instead of disappearing within , she turned and looked at me in white dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 5]: The door was bolted .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 11]: Her look roused what there was of manhood in me .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 21]: I felt that , as it had now come to the last gasp , it was mine to comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 13]: ` We are no worse than we were , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 6]: ` Never mind . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 11]: I do n't know that , ' she answered mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 12]: -- ` Can _ you _ go back as you came ?
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 7]: _ I _ ca n't . '
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 12]: I looked over the edge of the battlement where I stood .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 20]: There was the buttress crossing the angle of moonlight , with its shadow lying far down on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 11]: I shuddered at the thought of renewing my unspeakable dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 6]: But what must be must .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 20]: -LSB- Illustration : SHE BENT OVER THE BATTLEMENT , STOOPED HER FACE TOWARD ME , AND KISSED ME . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 29]: Besides , Clara had praised me for creeping where she could fly : now I might show her that I could creep where she could not fly . '
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 23]: I will try , ' I returned , putting one leg through an embrasure , and holding on by the adjoining battlement .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 24]: ` Do take care , Wilfrid , ' she cried , stretching out her hands , as if to keep me from falling .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 9]: A sudden pulse of life rushed through me .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: All at once I became not only bold , but ambitious .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 16]: ` Give me a kiss , ' I said , ` before I go . '
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 10]: ` Do you make so much of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 8]: she returned , stepping back a pace .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 10]: -- How much a woman she was even then !
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 19]: Her words roused something in me which to this day I have not been able quite to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 21]: A sense of wrong had its share in the feeling ; but what else I can hardly venture to say .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 13]: At all events , an inroad of careless courage was the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 22]: I stepped at once upon the buttress , and stood for a moment looking at her -- no doubt with reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 6]: She sprang towards me . '
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 9]: I beg your pardon , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 21]: The end of the buttress was a foot or two below the level of the leads , where Clara stood .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 19]: She bent over the battlement , stooped her face towards me , and kissed me on the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 42]: My only answer was to turn and walk down the buttress , erect ; a walk which , as the arch of the buttress became steeper , ended in a run and a leap on to the gutter of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 21]: There I turned , and saw her stand like a lady in a ballad leaning after me in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 27]: I lifted my cap and sped away , not knowing whither , but fancying that out of her sight I could make up my mind better .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 5]: Nor was I mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 24]: The moment I sat down , my brains began to go about , and in another moment I saw what might be attempted .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 28]: In going from roof to roof , I had seen the little gallery along which I had passed with Mrs Wilson on my way to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 13]: It crossed what might be called an open shaft in the building .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 19]: I thought I could manage , roofed as it was , to get in by the open side .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 29]: It was some time before I could find it again ; but when I did come upon it at last , I saw that it might be done .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 62]: By the help of a projecting gargoyle , curiously carved in the days when the wall to which it clung had formed part of the front of the building , I got my feet upon the wooden rail of the gallery , caught hold of one of the small pillars which supported the roof , and _ slewed _ myself in .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 40]: I was almost as glad as when I had crossed the buttress , for below me was a paved bottom , between high walls , without any door , like a dry well in the midst of the building .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 17]: My recollection of the way to the armoury , I found , however , almost obliterated .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 23]: I knew that I must pass through a bedroom at the end of the gallery , and that was all I remembered .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 19]: I opened the door , and found myself face to face with a young girl with wide eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: She stood staring and astonished , but not frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 11]: She was younger than Clara , and not so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: Her eyes looked dark , and also the hair she had been brushing .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 16]: Her face would have been quite pale , but for the rosy tinge of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 20]: She made no exclamation , only stared with her brush in her hand , and questions in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 16]: I felt far enough from comfortable ; but with a great effort I spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 15]: I had to get off the roof , and this was the only way .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: Please do not tell Mrs Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 20]: ` No , ' she said at once , very quietly ; ` but you must go away . '
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 10]: ` If I could only find the library ! '
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 17]: I am so afraid of going into more rooms where I have no business . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 32]: I will show you the way , ' she returned with a smile ; and laying down her brush , took up a candle , and led me from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 8]: In a few moments I was safe .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 6]: My conductor vanished at once .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 25]: The glimmer of my own candle in a further room guided me , and I was soon at the top of the corkscrew staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 21]: I found the door very slightly fastened : Clara must herself have unwittingly moved the bolt when she shut it .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 11]: I found her standing , all eagerness , waiting me .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 25]: We hurried back to the library , and there I told her how I had effected an entrance , and met with a guide .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 13]: ` It must have been little Polly Osborne , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 13]: ` Her mother is going to stay all night , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 12]: She 's a good-natured little goose , and wo n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 5]: -- Now come along .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 12]: We 'll have a peep from the picture-gallery into the ball-room .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 9]: That door is sure to be open . '
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 17]: ` If you do n't mind , Clara , I would rather stay where I am .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 18]: I ought n't to be wandering over the house when Mrs Wilson thinks I am here . '
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 8]: ` Oh , you little coward ! '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 20]: I thought I hardly deserved the word , and it did not make me more inclined to accompany her .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 10]: ` You can go alone , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 13]: ` You did not expect to find me when you came . '
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 6]: ` Of course I can .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 4]: Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 7]: It 's quite as well too .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 12]: You wo n't get me into any more scrapes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 13]: _ Did _ I get you into the scrape , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 15]: ` Yes , you did , ' she answered laughing , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 29]: I felt a good deal hurt , but comforted myself by saying she could not mean it , and sat down again to the _ Seven Champions _ .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 3]: THE GHOST .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 28]: I saw no more of Clara , but sat and read until I grew cold and tired , and wished very much that Mrs. Wilson would come .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 21]: I thought she might have forgot me in the hurry , and there I should have to stay all night .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 23]: After my recent escape , however , from a danger so much worse , I could regard the prospect with some composure .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 37]: A full hour more must have passed ; I was getting sleepy , and my candle had burned low , when at length Mrs Wilson did make her appearance , and I accompanied her gladly . '
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: I am sure you want your tea , poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 3]: ` Tea !
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 7]: Mrs. Wilson , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: ` It 's bed I want .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 15]: But when I think of it , I _ am _ rather hungry . '
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 14]: ` You shall have tea and bed both , ' she answered kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 22]: ` I 'm sorry you 've had such a dull evening , but I could _ not _ help it . '
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 24]: ` Indeed , I 've not been dull at all , ' I answered -- 'till just the last hour or so . '
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 23]: I longed to tell her all I had been about , for I felt guilty ; but I would not betray Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 8]: ` Well , here we are ! '
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 12]: she said , opening the door of her own room . '
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 16]: I hope I shall have peace enough to see you make a good meal . '
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 7]: I did make a good meal .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 15]: When I had done , Mrs Wilson took a rushlight and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 8]: I took my sword and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 14]: Into what quarter of the house she conducted me I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 18]: There was a nice fire burning in the room , and my night-apparel was airing before it .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 16]: She set the light on the floor , and left me with a kind good-night .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 20]: I was soon undressed and in bed , with my sword beside me on the coverlet of silk patchwork .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 27]: But , from whatever cause , sleepy as I had been a little while before , I lay wide awake now , staring about the room .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 57]: Like many others in the house , it was hung with tapestry , which was a good deal worn and patched -- notably in one place , where limbs of warriors and horses came to an untimely end , on all sides of a certain oblong piece quite different from the rest in colour and design .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 20]: I know now that it was a piece of _ Gobelins , _ in the midst of ancient needlework .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 47]: It looked the brighter of the two , but its colours were about three , with a good deal of white ; whereas that which surrounded it had had many and brilliant colours , which , faded and dull and sombre , yet kept their harmony .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 17]: The guard of the rushlight cast deeper and queerer shadows , as the fire sank lower .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 40]: Its holes gave eyes of light to some of the figures in the tapestry , and as the light wavered , the eyes wandered about in a ghostly manner , and the shadows changed and flickered and heaved uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 25]: How long I had lain thus I do not know ; but at last I found myself watching the rectangular patch of newer tapestry .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 7]: Could it be that it moved ?
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 13]: It _ could _ be only the effect of the wavering shadows .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 13]: And yet I could not convince myself that it did not move .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 6]: It _ did _ move .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 4]: It came forward .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 9]: One side of it did certainly come forward .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 17]: A kind of universal cramp seized me -- a contraction of every fibre of my body .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 20]: The patch opened like a door -- wider and wider ; and from behind came a great helmet peeping .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 29]: I was all one terror , but my nerves held out so far that I lay like a watching dog -- watching for what horror would come next .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 47]: The door opened wider , a mailed hand and arm appeared , and at length a figure , armed cap-à-pie , stepped slowly down , stood for a moment peering about , and then began to walk through the room , as if searching for something .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 9]: It came nearer and nearer to the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 20]: I wonder now , when I think of it , that the cold horror did not reach my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 15]: I can not have been so much a coward , surely , after all !
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 32]: But I suspect it was only that general paralysis prevented the extreme of terror , just as a man in the clutch of a wild beast is hardly aware of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 16]: At last the figure stooped over my bed , and stretched out a long arm .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 5]: I remember nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 9]: I woke in the grey of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 9]: Could a faint have passed into a sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 7]: or was it all a dream ?
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 15]: I lay for some time before I could recall what made me so miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 14]: At length my memory awoke , and I gazed fearful about the room .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 54]: The white ashes of the burnt-out fire were lying in the grate ; the stand of the rushlight was on the floor ; the wall with its tapestry was just as it had been ; the cold grey light had annihilated the fancied visions : I had been dreaming and was now awake .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 9]: But I could not lie longer in bed .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 5]: I must go out .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: The morning air would give me life ; I felt worn and weak .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 11]: Vision or dream , the room was hateful to me .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 26]: With a great effort I sat up , for I still feared to move , lest I should catch a glimpse of the armed figure .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 16]: Terrible as it had been in the night , it would be more terrible now .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 6]: I peered into every corner .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 4]: Each was vacant .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 27]: Then first I remembered that I had been reading the _ Castile of Otranto _ and the _ Seven Champions of Christendom _ the night before .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 26]: I jumped out of bed and dressed myself , growing braver and braver as the light of the lovely Spring morning swelled in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 13]: Having dipped my head in cold water , I was myself again .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 8]: I opened the lattice and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 13]: The first breath of air was a denial to the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 5]: I laughed at myself .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 8]: Earth and sky were alive with Spring .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 20]: The wind was the breath of the coming Summer : there were flakes of sunshine and shadow in it .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: Before me lay a green bank with a few trees on its top .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 10]: It was crowded with primroses growing through the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 26]: The dew was lying all about , shining and sparkling in the first rays of the level sun , which itself I could not see .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 14]: The tide of life rose in my heart and rushed through my limbs .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 14]: I would take my sword and go for a ramble through the park .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 16]: I went to my bedside , and stretched across to find it by the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 12]: It must have slipped down at the back of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 5]: Where could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 15]: In a word , I searched everywhere , but my loved weapon had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 16]: The visions of the night returned , and for a moment I believed them all .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 19]: The night once again closed around me , darkened yet more with the despair of an irreparable loss .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 19]: I rushed from the room and through a long passage , with the blind desire to get out .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 22]: The stare of an unwashed maid , already busy with her pail and brush , brought me to my senses . '
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 17]: I beg your pardon , ' I said ; ' I want to get out . '
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 30]: She left her implements , led me down a stair close at hand , opened a door at its foot , and let me out into the high court .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 5]: I gazed about me .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 36]: It was as if I had escaped from a prison-cell into the chamber of torture : I stood the centre of a multitude of windows -- the eyes of the house all fixed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 30]: On one side was the great gate , through which , from the roof , I had seen the carriages drive the night before ; but it was closed .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: I remembered , however , that Sir Giles had brought me in by a wicket in that gate .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 5]: I hastened to it .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 13]: There was but a bolt to withdraw , and I was free .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 14]: But all was gloomy within , and genial nature could no longer enter .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 17]: Glittering jewels of sunlight and dew were nothing but drops of water upon blades of grass .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 12]: Fresh-bursting trees were no more than the deadest of winter-bitten branches .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 25]: The great eastern window of the universe , gorgeous with gold and roses , was but the weary sun making a fuss about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 7]: My sole relief lay in motion .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 11]: I roamed I knew not whither , nor how long .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 24]: At length I found myself on a height eastward of the Hall , overlooking its gardens , which lay in deep terraces beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 32]: Inside a low wall was the first of them , dark with an avenue of ancient trees , and below was the large oriel window in the end of the ball-room .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 39]: I climbed over the wall , which was built of cunningly fitted stones , with mortar only in the top row ; and drawn by the gloom , strolled up and down the avenue for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 13]: At length I became aware of a voice I had heard before .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 21]: I could see no one ; but , hearkening about , I found it must come from the next terrace .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 33]: Descending by a deep flight of old mossy steps , I came upon a strip of smooth sward , with yew trees , dark and trim , on each side of it .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 21]: At the end of the walk was an arbour , in which I could see the glimmer of something white .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 12]: Too miserable to be shy , I advanced and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 17]: The girl who had shown me the way to the library was talking to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 4]: ` Mamma ! '
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 22]: she said , without showing any surprise , ` here is the boy who came into our room last night . '
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 7]: ` How do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 15]: said the lady kindly , making room for me on the bench beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 21]: I answered as politely as I could , and felt a strange comfort glide from the sweetness of her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 10]: ` What an adventure you had last night ! '
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 10]: ` It was well you did not fall . '
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 20]: ` That would n't have been much worse than having to stop where we were , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 20]: The conversation thus commenced went on until I had told them all my history , including my last adventure .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 12]: ` You must have dreamed it , ' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 22]: ` So I thought , ma'am , ' I answered , ` until I found that my sword was gone . '
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 9]: ` Are you sure you looked everywhere ? '
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: ` Indeed , I did . '
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 12]: ` It does not follow however that the ghost took it .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 22]: It is more likely Mrs Wilson came in to see you after you were asleep , and carried it off . '
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 5]: ` Oh yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 14]: I cried , rejoiced at the suggestion ; ` that must be it .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: I shall ask her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 9]: I am sure you will find it so .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 7]: Are you going home soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 12]: ` Yes -- as soon as I 've had my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 11]: It 's a good walk from here to Aldwick . '
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 5]: ` So it is .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 9]: -- We are going that way too ? '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 4]: she added thinkingly .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 18]: ` Mr. Elder is a great friend of papa 's -- is n't he , mamma ? '
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 6]: ` Yes , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 8]: They were friends at college . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 14]: I have heard Mr Elder speak of Mr Osborne , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: ` Do you live near us ? '
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 21]: ` Not very far off -- in the next parish , where my husband is rector , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 18]: ` If you could wait till the afternoon , we should be happy to take you there .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 8]: The pony-carriage is coming for us . '
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 20]: ` Thank you , ma'am , ' I answered ; ` but I ought to go immediately after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 11]: You wo n't mention about the roof , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 10]: I ought n't to get Clara into trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 22]: ` She is a wild girl , ' said Mrs Osborne ; ` but I think you are quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 11]: ` How lucky it was I knew the library ! '
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 16]: said Mary , who had become quite friendly , from under her mother 's wing .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 5]: ` That it was !
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 15]: But I dare say you know all about the place , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 6]: ` No , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 4]: she returned . '
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 6]: I know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 31]: As we went to our room , mamma opened the door and showed me the library , else I should n't have been able to help you at all . '
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: ` Then you have n't been here often ? '
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 10]: ` No ; and I never shall be again .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 17]: -- I 'm going away to school , ' she added ; and her voice trembled .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 9]: ` So am I , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 12]: ` I 'm going to Switzerland in a month or two .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 13]: But then I have n't a mamma to leave behind me . '
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 16]: She broke down at that , and hid her head on her mother 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 18]: I had unawares added to her grief , for her brother Charley was going to Switzerland too .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 28]: I found afterwards that Mr Elder , having been consulted by Mr Osborne , had arranged with my uncle that Charley Osborne and I should go together .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 40]: Mary Osborne -- I never called her Polly as Clara did -- continued so overcome by her grief , that her mother turned to me and said , ' I think you had better go , Master Cumbermede . '
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 16]: I bade her good morning , and made my way to Mrs Wilson 's apartment .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 26]: I found she had been to my room , and was expecting me with some anxiety , fearing I had set off without my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 49]: she knew nothing about the sword , looked annoyed , and , I thought , rather mysterious ; said she would have a search , make inquiries , do what she could , and such like , but begged I would say nothing about it in the house .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 29]: I left her with a suspicion that she believed the ghost had carried it away , and that it was of no use to go searching for it .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 10]: Two days after , a parcel arrived for me .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 49]: I concluded it was my sword ; but , to my grievous disappointment , found it was only a large hamper of apples and cakes , very acceptable in themselves , but too plainly indicating Mrs Wilson 's desire to console me for what could not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 7]: Mr Elder never missed the sword .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 43]: I rose high in the estimation of my schoolfellows because of the adventure , especially in that of Moberly , who did not believe in the ghost , but ineffectually tasked his poor brains to account for the disappearance of the weapon .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 34]: The best light was thrown upon it by a merry boy of the name of Fisher , who declared his conviction that the steward had carried it off to add to his collection .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 2]: AWAY .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 26]: Will not linger longer over this part of my history -- already , I fear , much too extended for the patience of my readers .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 31]: My excuse is that , in looking back , the events I have recorded appear large and prominent , and that certainly they have a close relation with my after-history .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 12]: The time arrived when I had to leave England for Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 8]: I will say nothing of my leave-taking .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 7]: It was not a bitter one .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 10]: Hope was strong , and rooted in present pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 20]: I was capable of much happiness -- keenly responsive to the smallest agreeable impulse from without or from within .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 12]: I had good health , and life was happiness in itself .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 42]: The blowing of the wind , the shining of the sun , or the glitter of water , was sufficient to make me glad ; and I had self-consciousness enough to increase the delight by the knowledge that I was glad .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 29]: The fact is I was coming in for my share in the spiritual influences of Nature , so largely poured on the heart and mind of my generation .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 16]: The prophets of the new blessing , Wordsworth and Coleridge , I knew nothing of .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 7]: Keats was only beginning to write .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 15]: I had read a little of Cowper , but did not care for him .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 11]: Yet I was under the same spell as they all .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 7]: Nature was a power upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 29]: I was filled with the vague recognition of a present soul in Nature -- with a sense of the humanity everywhere diffused through her and operating upon ours .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 28]: I was but fourteen , and had only feelings , but something lay at the heart of the feelings , which would one day blossom into thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 27]: At the coach-office in the county-town , I first met my future companion , with his father , who was to see us to our destination .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 33]: My uncle accompanied me no further , and I soon found myself on the top of a coach , with only one thing to do -- make the acquaintance of Charles Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 26]: His father was on the box-seat , and we two sat behind ; but we were both shy , and for some time neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 26]: Charles was about my own age , rather like his sister , only that his eyes were blue , and his hair a lightish brown .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 10]: A tremulousness about the mouth betrayed a nervous temperament .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 13]: His skin was very fair and thin , showing the blue veins .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 33]: As he did not speak , I sat for a little while watching him , without , however , the least speculation concerning him , or any effort to discover his character .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 15]: I had not even yet reached the point of trying to find people out .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 36]: I take what time and acquaintance disclose , but never attempt to forestall , which may come partly from trust , partly from want of curiosity , partly from a disinclination to unnecessary mental effort .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 29]: But as I watched his face , half-unconsciously , I could not help observing that now and then it would light up suddenly and darken again almost instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 28]: At last his father turned round , and with some severity , said : ` You do not seem to be making any approaches to mutual acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 11]: Charles , why do n't you address your companion ? '
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 19]: The words were uttered in the slow tone of one used to matters too serious for common speech .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 19]: The boy cast a hurried glance at me , smiled uncertainly , and moved uneasily on his seat .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 12]: His father turned away and made a remark to the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 25]: Mr Osborne was a very tall , thin , yet square-shouldered man , with a pale face , and large features of delicate form .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 9]: He looked severe , pure , and irritable .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 40]: The tone of his voice , although the words were measured and rather stilted , led me to this last conclusion quite as much as the expression of his face ; for it was thin and a little acrid .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 33]: I soon observed that Charley started slightly , as often as his father addressed him ; but this might be because his father always did so with more or less of abruptness .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 26]: At times there was great kindness in his manner , seeming , however , less the outcome of natural tenderness than a sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 21]: His being was evidently a weight upon his son 's , and kept down the natural movements of his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 26]: A number of small circumstances only led me to these conclusions ; for nothing remarkable occurred to set in any strong light their mutual relation .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 30]: For his side Charles was always attentive and ready , although with a promptitude that had more in it of the mechanical impulse of habit than of pleased obedience .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 29]: Mr Osborne spoke kindly to me -- I think the more kindly that I was not his son , and he was therefore not so responsible for me .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 44]: But he looked as if the care of the whole world lay on his shoulders ; as if an awful destruction were the most likely thing to happen to every one , and to him were committed the toilsome chance of saving some .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 39]: Doubtless he would not have trusted his boy so far from home , but that the clergyman to whom he was about to hand him over was an old friend , of the same religious opinions as himself .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 24]: I could well , but must not , linger over the details of our journey , full to me of most varied pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 52]: The constant change , not so rapid as to prevent the mind from reposing a little upon the scenes which presented themselves ; the passing vision of countries and peoples , manners and modes of life , so different from our own , did much to arouse and develop my nature .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 34]: Those flashes of pleasure came upon Charles 's pale face more and more frequently ; and ere the close of the first day we had begun to talk with some degree of friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 63]: But it became clear to me that with his father ever blocking up our horizon , whether he sat with his broad back in front of us on the coach-box , or paced the deck of a vessel , or perched with us under the hood on the top of a diligence , we should never arrive at any freedom of speech .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 55]: I sometimes wondered , long after , whether Mr Osborne had begun to discover that he was overlaying and smothering the young life of his boy , and had therefore adopted the plan , so little to have been expected from him , of sending his son to foreign parts to continue his education .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 18]: I have no distinct recollection of dates , or even of the exact season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 25]: I believe it was the early Summer , but in my memory the whole journey is now a mass of confused loveliness and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 12]: Not that we had the best of weather all the way .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 37]: I well recollect pouring rains , and from the fact that I distinctly remember my first view of an Alpine height , I am certain we must have had days of mist and rain immediately before .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 53]: That sight , however , to me more like an individual revelation or vision than the impact of an object upon the brain , stands in my mind altogether isolated from preceding and following impressions -- alone , a thing to praise God for , if there be a God to praise .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 35]: If there be not , then was the whole thing a grand and lovely illusion , worthy , for grandeur and loveliness , of a world with a God at the heart of it .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 30]: But the grandeur and the loveliness spring from the operation of natural laws ; the laws themselves are real and true -- how could the false result from them ?
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 47]: I hope yet , and will hope , that I am not a bubble filled with the mocking breath of a Mephistopheles , but a child whom his infinite Father will not hardly judge because he could not believe in him so much as he would .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: I will tell how the vision came .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 31]: Although comparatively few people visited Switzerland in those days , Mr Osborne had been there before , and for some reason or other had determined on going round by Interlachen .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 17]: At Thun we found a sail-boat , which we hired to take us and our luggage .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 22]: At starting , an incident happened which would not be worth mentioning , but for the impression it made upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 75]: A French lady accompanied by a young girl approached Mr Osborne -- doubtless perceiving he was a clergyman , for , being an _ Evangelical _ of the most pure , honest , and narrow type , he was in every point and line of his countenance marked a priest and apart from his fellow-men -- and asked him to allow her and her daughter to go in the boat with us to Interlachen .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 35]: A glow of pleasure awoke in me at sight of his courtly behaviour , with lifted hat and bowed head ; for I had never been in the company of such a gentleman before .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 15]: But the wish instantly followed that his son might have shared in his courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 22]: We partook freely of his justice and benevolence , but he showed us no such grace as he showed the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 15]: I have since observed that sons are endlessly grateful for courtesy from their fathers .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 33]: The lady and her daughter sat down in the stern of the boat ; and therefore Charley and I , not certainly to our discomfiture , had to go before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 14]: The men rowed out into the lake , and then hoisted the sail .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 9]: Away we went careering before a pleasant breeze .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 20]: As yet it blew fog and mist , but the hope was that it would soon blow it away .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 29]: An unspoken friendship by this time bound Charley and me together , silent in its beginnings and slow in its growth -- not the worst pledges of endurance .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 23]: And now for the first time in our journey , Charley was hidden from his father : the sail came between them .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 21]: He glanced at me with a slight sigh , which even then I took for an involuntary sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 48]: We lay leaning over the bows , now looking up at the mist blown in never-ending volumed sheets , now at the sail swelling in the wind before which it fled , and again down at the water through which our boat was ploughing its evanescent furrow .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 6]: We could see very little .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 29]: Portions of the shore would now and then appear , dim like reflections from a tarnished mirror , and then fade back into the depths of cloudy dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 32]: Still it was growing lighter , and the man who was on the outlook became less anxious in his forward gaze , and less frequent in his calls to the helmsman .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 32]: I was lying half over the gunwale , looking into the strange-coloured water , blue dimmed with undissolved white , when a cry from Charles made me start and look up .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 7]: It was indeed a God-like vision .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 47]: The mist yet rolled thick below , but away up , far away and far up , yet as if close at hand , the clouds were broken into a mighty window , through which looked in upon us a huge mountain peak swathed in snow .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 37]: One great level band of darker cloud crossed its breast , above which rose the peak , triumphant in calmness , and stood unutterably solemn and grand , in clouds as white as its 0wn whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: It had been there all the time !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 12]: I sunk on my knees in the boat and gazed up .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 21]: With a sudden sweep the clouds curtained the mighty window , and the Jungfrau withdrew into its Holy of Holies .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 11]: I am painfully conscious of the helplessness of my speech .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 14]: The vision vanishes from the words as it vanished from the bewildered eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 11]: But from the mind it glorified it has never vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 11]: I have _ been _ more ever since that sight .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: To have beheld a truth is an apotheosis .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 30]: What the truth was I could not tell ; but I had seen something which raised me above my former self and made me long to rise higher yet .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 79]: It awoke worship , and a belief in the incomprehensible divine ; but admitted of being analysed no more than , in that transient vision , my intellect could -- ere dawning it vanished -- analyse it into the deserts of rock , the gulfs of green ice and flowing water , the savage solitudes of snow , the mysterious miles of draperied mist , that went to make up the vision , each and all essential thereto .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 27]: I had been too much given to the attempted production in myself of effects to justify the vague theories towards which my inborn prepossessions carried me .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 54]: I had felt enough to believe there was more to be felt ; and such stray scraps of verse of the new order as , floating about , had reached me , had set me questioning and testing my own life and perceptions and sympathies by what these awoke in me at second-hand .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 34]: I had often doubted , oppressed by the power of these , whether I could myself see , or whether my sympathy with Nature was not merely inspired by the vision of others .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 22]: Ever after this , if such a doubt returned , with it arose the Jungfrau , looking into my very soul .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 5]: ` Oh Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 6]: was all I could say .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 10]: Our hands met blindly , and clasped each other .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 6]: I burst into silent tears .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 13]: When I looked up , Charley was staring into the mist again .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 32]: His eyes , too , were full of tears , but some troubling contradiction prevented their flowing : I saw it by the expression of that mobile but now firmly-closed mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 21]: Often ere we left Switzerland I saw similar glories : this vision remains alone , for it was the first .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 49]: I will not linger over the tempting delight of the village near which we landed , its houses covered with quaintly-notched wooden scales like those of a fish , and its river full to the brim of white-blue water , rushing from the far-off bosom of the glaciers .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 35]: I had never had such a sense of exuberance and plenty as this river gave me -- especially where it filled the planks and piles of wood that hemmed it in like a trough .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 16]: I might agonize in words for a day and I should not express the delight .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 56]: And , lest my readers should apprehend a diary of a tour , I shall say nothing more of our journey , remarking only that if Switzerland were to become as common to the mere tourist mind as Cheapside is to a Londoner , the meanest of its glories would be no whit impaired thereby .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 104]: Sometimes , I confess , in these days of overcrowded cities , when , in periodical floods , the lonely places of the earth are from them inundated , I do look up to the heavens and say to myself that there at least , between the stars , even in thickest of nebulous constellations , there is yet plenty of pure , unadulterated room -- not even a vapour to hang a colour upon ; but presently I return to my better mind and say that any man who loves his fellow will yet find he has room enough and to spare .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 3]: THE ICE-CAVE .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 20]: During our journey , Mr Osborne had seldom talked to us , and far more seldom in speech sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 49]: If by chance I came out with anything I thought or felt , even if he did not disapprove altogether , he would yet first lay hold of something to which he could object , coming round only by degrees , and with differences , to express consent .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 11]: Evidently with him objection was the first step in instruction .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 29]: It was better in his eyes to say you were wrong than to say you were right , even if you should be much more right than wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 60]: He had not the smallest idea of siding with the truth in you , of digging about it and watering it until it grew a great tree in which all your thought-birds might nestle and sing their songs ; but he must be ever against the error -- forgetting that the only antagonist of the false is the true .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 47]: ` What , ' I used to think in after-years , ` is the use of battering the walls to get at the error , when the kindly truth is holding the postern open for you to enter , and pitch it out of window . '
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 59]: The evening before we parted , he gave us a solemn admonishment on the danger of being led astray by what men called the beauties of Nature -- for the heart was so desperately wicked that , even of the things God had made _ to show his power _ , it would make snares for our destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 51]: I will not go on with his homily , out of respect for the man ; for there was much earnestness in him , and it would utterly shame me if I were supposed to hold that up to the contempt which the forms it took must bring upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 23]: Besides , he made such a free use of the most sacred of names , that I shrink from representing his utterance .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 40]: A good man I do not doubt he was ; but he did the hard parts of his duty to the neglect of the genial parts , and therefore was not a man to help others to be good .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 33]: His own son revived the moment he took his leave of us -- began to open up as the little red flower called the Shepherd 's Hour-Glass opens when the cloud withdraws .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 23]: It is a terrible thing when the father is the cloud , and not the sun , of his child 's life .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 32]: If Charley had been like the greater number of boys I have known , all this would only have hardened his mental and moral skin by the natural process of accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 14]: But his skin would not harden , and the evil wrought the deeper .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 48]: From his father he had inherited a conscience of abnormal sensibility ; but he could not inherit the religious dogmas by means of which his father had partly deadened , partly distorted his ; and constant pressure and irritation had already generated a great soreness of surface .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 16]: When he began to open up , it was after a sad fashion at first .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 26]: To resume my simile of the pimpernel -- it was to disclose a heart in which the glowing purple was blanched to a sickly violet .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 22]: What happiness he had , came in fits and bursts , and passed as quickly , leaving him depressed and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 24]: He was always either wishing to be happy , or trying to be sure of the grounds of the brief happiness he had .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 35]: He allowed the natural blessedness of his years hardly a chance : the moment its lobes appeared above ground , he was handling them , examining them , and trying to pull them open .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 7]: No wonder they crept underground again !
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 26]: It may seem hardly credible that such should be the case with a boy of fifteen , but I am not mistaken in my diagnosis .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 7]: I will go a little further .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 25]: Gifted with the keenest perceptions , and a nature unusually responsive to the feelings of others , he was born to be an artist .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 42]: But he was content neither with his own suggestions , nor with understanding those of another ; he must , by the force of his own will , generate his friend 's feeling in himself , not perceiving the thing impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 20]: This was one point at which we touched , and which went far to enable me to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 19]: The original in him was thus constantly repressed , and he suffered from the natural consequences of repression .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 20]: He suffered also on the physical side from a tendency to disease of the lungs inherited from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 28]: Mr Forest 's house stood high on the Grindelwald side of the Wengern Alp , under a bare grassy height full of pasture both Summer and Winter .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 19]: In front was a great space , half meadow , half common , rather poorly covered with hill-grasses .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 23]: The rock was near the surface , and in places came through , when the grass was changed for lichens and mosses .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 29]: Through this rocky meadow now roamed , now rushed , now tumbled one of those Alpine streams the very thought of whose ice-born plenitude makes me happy yet .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 20]: Its banks were not abrupt , but rounded gently in , and grassy down to the water 's brink .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 25]: The larger torrents of Winter wore the channel wide , and the sinking of the water in Summer let the grass grow within it .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 69]: But peaceful as the place was , and merry with the constant rush of this busy stream , it had , even in the hottest Summer day , a memory of the Winter about it , a look of suppressed desolation ; for the only trees upon it were a score of straggling pines -- all dead , as if blasted by lightning , or smothered by snow .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 25]: Perhaps they were the last of the forest in that part , and their roots had reached a stratum where they could not live .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 17]: All I know is that there they stood , blasted and dead every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 15]: Charley could never bear them , and even disliked the place because of them .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 14]: His father was one whom a mote in his brother 's eye repelled .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 32]: The son suffered for this in twenty ways -- one of which was that a single spot in the landscape was to him enough to destroy the loveliness of exquisite surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 11]: A good way below lay the valley of the Grindelwald .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 10]: The Eiger and the Matterhorn were both within sight .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 28]: If a man has any sense of the infinite , he can not fail to be rendered capable of higher things by such embodiments of the high .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 22]: Otherwise , they are heaps of dirt , to be scrambled up and conquered , for scrambling and conquering 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 13]: They are but warts , Pelion and Ossa and all of them .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 8]: They seemed to oppress Charley at first .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 29]: ` Oh , Willie , ' he said to me one day , ` if I could but believe in those mountains , how happy I should be !
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 14]: But I doubt , I doubt they are but rocks and snow . '
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 6]: I only half understood him .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 12]: I am afraid I never did understand him more than half .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 33]: Later I came to the conclusion that this was not the fit place for him , and that if his father had understood him , he would never have sent him there .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 14]: It was some time before Mr Forest would take us any mountain ramble .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 22]: He said we must first get accustomed to the air of the place , else the precipices would turn our brains .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 12]: He allowed us , however , to range within certain bounds .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 39]: One day soon after our arrival , we accompanied one of our schoolfellows down to the valley of the Grindelwald , specially to see the head of the snake-glacier , which having crept thither can creep no further .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 11]: Somebody had even then hollowed out a cave in it .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 14]: We crossed a little brook which issued from it constantly , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 20]: Charley uttered a cry of dismay , but I was too much delighted at the moment to heed him .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 24]: For the whole of the white cavern was filled with blue air , so blue that I saw the air which filled it .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 21]: Perfectly transparent , it had no substance , only blueness , which deepened and deepened as I went further in .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 35]: All down the smooth white walls evermore was stealing a thin veil of dissolution ; while here and there little runnels of the purest water were tumbling in tiny cataracts from top to bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 39]: It was one of the thousand birthplaces of streams , ever creeping into the day of vision from the unlike and the unknown , unrolling themselves like the fronds of a fern out of the infinite of God .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 29]: Ice was all around , hard and cold and dead and white ; but out of it and away went the water babbling and singing in the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 6]: ` Oh , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 11]: I exclaimed , looking round in my transport for sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 19]: It was now my turn to cry out , for Charley 's face was that of a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 17]: The brilliant blue of the cave made us look to each other most ghastly and fearful .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 19]: ` Do come out , Wilfrid , ' he said ; ' I can not bear it . '
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 14]: I put my arm in his , and we walked into the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 24]: He drew a deep breath of relief , and turned to me with an attempt at a smile , but his lip quivered .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: ` It 's an awful place , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 6]: I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 6]: Do n't go in again .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 13]: I should stand waiting to see you come out in a winding-sheet .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 10]: I think there 's something wrong with my brain .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 9]: That blue seems to have got into it .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 7]: I see everything horribly dead . '
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 33]: On the way back he started several times , and looked , round as if with involuntary apprehension , but mastered himself with an effort , and joined again in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 22]: Before we reached home he was much fatigued , and complaining of head-ache , went to bed immediately on our arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 7]: We slept in the same room .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 13]: When I went up at the usual hour , he was awake .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 9]: ` Ca n't you sleep , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 24]: ` I 've been asleep several times , ' he answered , ` but I 've had such a horrible dream every time !
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 28]: We were all corpses that could n't get to sleep , and went about pawing the slimy walls of our marble sepulchre -- so cold and wet !
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 9]: It was that horrible ice-cave , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 15]: But then you know that 's just what it is , Wilfrid . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 28]: I do n't know what you mean , ' I said , instinctively turning from the subject , for the glitter of his blue eyes looked bodeful .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 68]: I did not know then how like he and I were , or how like my fate might have been to his , if , instead of finding at once a fit food for my fancy , and a safety-valve for its excess , in those old romances , I had had my regards turned inwards upon myself , before I could understand the phenomena there exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 22]: Certainly I too should have been thus rendered miserable , and body and soul would have mutually preyed on each other .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 7]: I sought to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 25]: I could never talk to him about his father , but he had always been ready to speak of his mother and his sister .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 10]: Now , however , I could not rouse him .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 5]: ` Poor mamma ! '
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 41]: was all the response he made to some admiring remark ; and when I mentioned his sister Mary , he only said , ` She 's a good girl , our Mary , ' and turned uneasily towards the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 5]: I went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 9]: He lay quiet , and I fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 13]: When I woke in the morning , I found him very unwell .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 12]: I suppose the illness had been coming on for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 7]: He was in a low fever .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 15]: As the doctor declared it not infectious , I was allowed to nurse him .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: He was often delirious , and spoke the wildest things .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 13]: Especially , he would converse with the Saviour after the strangest fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 7]: He lay ill for some weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 40]: Mr Forest would not allow me to sit up with him at night , but I was always by his bedside early in the morning , and did what I could to amuse and comfort him through the day .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 29]: When at length he began to grow better , he was more cheerful than I had known him hitherto ; but he remained very weak for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 18]: He had grown a good deal during his illness , and indeed never looked a boy again .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 4]: AMONG THE MOUNTAINS .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 34]: One summer morning we all got up very early , except Charley , who was unfit for the exertion , to have a ramble in the mountains , and see the sun rise .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 148]: The fresh friendly air , full of promise , greeting us the moment we crossed the threshold ; the calm light which , without visible source , lay dream-like on the hills ; the brighter space in the sky whence ere long the spring of glory would burst forth triumphant ; the dull white of the snow-peaks , dwelling so awful and lonely in the mid heavens , as if nothing should ever comfort them or make them acknowledge the valleys below ; the sense of adventure with which we climbed the nearer heights as familiar to our feet on ordinary days as the stairs to our bedrooms ; the gradual disappearance of the known regions behind us , and the dawning sense of the illimitable and awful , folding in its bosom the homely and familiar -- combined to produce an impression which has never faded .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 46]: The sun rose in splendour , as if nothing more should hide in the darkness for ever ; and yet with the light came a fresh sense of mystery , for now that which had appeared smooth was all broken and mottled with shadows innumerable .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 77]: Again and again I found myself standing still to gaze in a rapture of delight which I can only recall , not express ; again and again was I roused by the voice of the master in front , shouting to me to come on , and warning me of the danger of losing sight of the rest of the company ; and again and again I obeyed , but without any perception of the peril .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 48]: The intention was to cross the hills into the valley of the Lauterbrunnen , not , however , by the path now so well known , but by another way , hardly a path , with which the master and some of the boys were familiar enough .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: It was my first experience of anything like real climbing .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 46]: As we passed rapidly over a moorland space , broken with huge knolls and solitary rocks , something hurt my foot , and taking off my shoe , I found that a small chiropodical operation was necessary , which involved the use of my knife .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 20]: It slipped , and cut my foot , and I bound the wound with a strip from my pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 13]: When I got up , I found that my companions had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 39]: This gave me little trouble at the moment , for I had no doubt of speedily overtaking them ; and I set out briskly in the direction , as I supposed , in which we had been going .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 21]: But I presume that , instead of following them , I began at once to increase the distance between us .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 23]: At all events , I had not got far before a pang of fear shot through me -- the first awaking doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 22]: I called -- louder -- and louder yet ; but there was no response , and I knew I was alone .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 18]: Invaded by sudden despair , I sat down , and for a moment did not even think .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 17]: All at once I became aware of the abysses which surrounded the throne of my isolation .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 62]: Behind me the broken ground rose to an unseen height , and before me it sloped gently downwards , without a break to the eye , yet I felt as if , should I make one wavering movement , I must fall down one of the frightful precipices which Mr Forest had told me as a warning lay all about us .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 31]: I actually clung to the stone upon which I sat , although I could not have been in more absolute safety for the moment had I been dreaming in bed .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 16]: The old fear had returned upon me with a tenfold feeling of reality behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 82]: I presume it is so all through life : it is not what is , but what may be , that oftenest blanches the cheek and paralyzes the limbs ; and oftenest gives rise to that sense of the need of a God which we are told nowadays is a superstition , and which he whom we call the Saviour acknowledged and justified in telling us to take no thought for the morrow , inasmuch as God took thought for it .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 45]: I strove to master my dismay , and forced myself to get up and run about ; and in a few minutes the fear had withdrawn into the background , and I felt no longer an unseen force dragging me towards a frightful gulf .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 10]: But it was replaced by a more spiritual horror .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 18]: The sense of loneliness seized upon me , and the first sense of absolute loneliness is awful .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 50]: Independent as a man may fancy himself in the heart of a world of men , he is only to be convinced that there is neither voice nor hearing , to know that the face from which he most recoils is of a kind essential to his very soul .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 38]: Space is not room ; and when we complain of the over-crowding of our fellows , we are thankless for that which comforts us the most , and desire its absence in ignorance of our deepest nature .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 8]: Not even a bird broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 21]: It lay upon my soul as the sky and the sea lay upon the weary eye of the ancient mariner .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 13]: It is useless to attempt to convey the impression of my misery .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 102]: It was not yet the fear of death , or of hunger or thirst , for I had as yet no adequate idea of the vast lonelinesses that lie in a mountain land : it was simply the being alone , with no ear to hear and no voice to answer me -- a torture to which the soul is liable in virtue of the fact that it was not made to be alone , yea , I think , I hope , never _ can _ be alone ; for that which could be fact could not be such horror .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 25]: Essential horror springs from an idea repugnant to the _ nature _ of the thinker , and which therefore in reality could not be .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 11]: My agony rose and rose with every moment of silence .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 55]: But when it reached its height , and when , to save myself from bursting into tears , I threw myself on the ground , and began gnawing at the plants about me -- then first came help : I had a certain _ experience _ , as the Puritans might have called it .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 29]: I fear to build any definite conclusions upon it , from the dread of fanaticism and the danger of attributing a merely physical effect to a spiritual cause .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 9]: But are matter and spirit so far asunder ?
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 14]: It is my will moves my arm , whatever first moves my will .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 34]: Besides , I do not understand how , unless another influence came into operation , the extreme of misery and depression should work round into such a change as I have to record .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 11]: But I do not know how to describe the change .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 20]: The silence was crushing or rather sucking my life out of me -- up into its own empty gulfs .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 33]: The horror of the great stillness was growing deathly , when all at once I rose to my feet , with a sense of power and confidence I had never had before .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 14]: It was as if something divine within me awoke to outface the desolation .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 15]: I felt that it was time to act , and that I could act .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 29]: There is no cure for terror like action : in a few moments I could have approached the verge of any precipice -- at least without abject fear .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 16]: The silence -- no longer a horrible vacancy -- appeared to tremble with unuttered thinkings .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 9]: The manhood within me was alive and awake .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 17]: I could not recognize a single landmark , or discover the least vestige of a path .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: I knew upon which hand the sun was when we started ; and took my way with the sun on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 9]: But a cloud had already come over him .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 36]: I had not gone far before I saw in front of me , on the other side of a little hillock , something like the pale blue grey fog that broods over a mountain lake .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 25]: I ascended the hillock , and started back with a cry of dismay : I was on the very verge of an awful gulf .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 18]: When I think of it , I marvel yet that I did not lose my self-possession altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 16]: I only turned and strode in the other direction -- the faster for the fear .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 13]: But I dared not run , for I was haunted by precipices .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 18]: Over every height , every mound , one might be lying -- a trap for my destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 36]: I no longer looked out in the hope of recognizing some feature of the country ; I could only regard the ground before me , lest at any step I might come upon an abyss .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 13]: I had not walked far before the air began to grow dark .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: I glanced again at the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 8]: The clouds had gathered thick about him .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: Suddenly a mountain wind blew cold in my face .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 92]: I never yet can read that sonnet of Shakspere 's , Full many a glorious morning I have seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye , Kissing with golden face the meadows green , Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy ; Anon permit the basest clouds to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face , And from the forlorn world his visage hide , Stealing unseen to west with his disgrace , -- without recalling the gladness when I started from home and the misery that so soon followed .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 10]: But my new spirits did not yet give way .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 4]: I trudged on .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 16]: The wind increased , and in it came by-and-by the trailing skirts of a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 11]: In a few moments more I was wrapped in mist .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 26]: It was as if the gulf from which I had just escaped had sent up its indwelling demon of fog to follow and overtake me .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 11]: I dared hardly go on even with the greatest circumspection .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 9]: As I grew colder , my courage declined .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 43]: The mist wetted my face and sank through my clothes , and I began to feel very wretched , I sat down , not merely from dread of the precipices , but to reserve my walking powers when the mist should withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 30]: I began to shiver , and was getting utterly hopeless and miserable when the fog lifted a little , and I saw what seemed a great rock near me .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 5]: I crept towards it .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 22]: Almost suddenly it dwindled , and I found but a stone , yet one large enough to afford me some shelter .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 15]: I went to the leeward side of it , and nestled at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 25]: The mist again sank , and the wind blew stronger , but I was in comparative comfort , partly because my imagination was wearied .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 5]: I fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 6]: I awoke stiff with cold .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 29]: Rain was falling in torrents , and I was wet to the skin ; but the mist was much thinner , and I could see a good way .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 25]: For awhile I was very heartless , what with the stiffness , and the fear of having to spend the night on the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 15]: I was hungry too , not with the appetite of desire but of need .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 16]: The worst was that I had no idea in what direction I ought to go .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 10]: Downwards lay precipices -- upwards lay the surer loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 39]: I knelt , and prayed the God who dwelt in the silence to help me ; then strode away I knew not whither -- up the hill in the faint hope of discovering some sign to direct me .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 7]: As I climbed the hill rose .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 15]: When I surmounted what had seemed the highest point , away beyond rose another .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 17]: But the slopes were not over-steep , and I was able to get on pretty fast .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 36]: The wind being behind me , I hoped for some shelter over the highest brow , but that , for anything I knew , might be miles away in the regions of ice and snow .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 9]: -LSB- Illustration : I FELL FAST ASLEEP . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 42]: I had been walking I should think about an hour , when the mist broke away from around me , and the sun , in the midst of clouds of dull orange and gold , shone out upon the wet hill .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 26]: It was like a promise of safety , and woke in me courage to climb the steep and crumbling slope which now lay before me .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 5]: But the fear returned .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 22]: People had died in the mountains of hunger , and I began to make up my mind to meet the worst .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 18]: I had not learned that the approach of any fate is just the preparation for that fate .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 15]: I troubled myself with the care of that which was not impending over me .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 13]: I tried to contemplate the death-struggle with equanimity , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 14]: Had I been wearier and fainter , it would have appeared less dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 84]: Then , in the horror of the slow death of hunger , strange as it may appear , that which had been the special horror of my childish dreams returned upon me changed into a thought of comfort : I could , ere my strength failed me utterly , seek the verge of a precipice , lie down there , and when the suffering grew strong enough to give me courage , roll myself over the edge , and cut short the agony .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 18]: At length I gained the brow of the height , and at last the ground sank beyond .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 19]: There was no precipice to terrify , only a somewhat steep descent into a valley large and wide .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 13]: But what a vision arose on the opposite side of that valley !
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 17]: -- an upright wilderness of rocks , slopes , precipices , snow , glaciers , avalanches !
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 34]: Weary and faint as I was , I was filled with a glorious awe , the terror of which was the opposite of fear , for it lifted instead of debasing the soul .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 34]: Not a pine-tree softened the haggard waste ; not a single stray sheep of the wind 's flock drew one trail of its thin-drawn wool behind it ; all was hard and bare .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 60]: The glaciers lay like the skins of cruel beasts , with the green veins yet visible , nailed to the rocks to harden in the sun ; and the little streams which ran down from their claws looked like the knife-blades they are , keen and hard and shining , sawing away at the bones of the old mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 20]: But although the mountain looked so silent , there came from it every now and then a thunderous sound .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 70]: At first I could not think what it was , but gazing at its surface more steadily , upon the face of a slope I caught sight of what seemed a larger stream than any of the rest ; but it soon ceased to flow , and after came the thunder of its fall : it _ was _ a stream , but a solid one -- an avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 17]: Away up in the air the huge snow-summit glittered in the light of the Afternoon sun .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 32]: I was gazing on the Maiden in one of her most savage moods -- or to speak prose -- I was regarding one of the wildest aspects of the many-sided Jungfrau .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 25]: Half way down the hill , almost right under my feet , rose a slender column of smoke , I could not see whence .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 16]: I hastened towards it , feeling as strong as when I started in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 29]: I zig-zagged down the slope , for it was steep and slippery with grass , and arrived at length at a good-sized cottage , which faced the Jungfrau .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 43]: It was built of great logs laid horizontally one above the other , all with notches half through near the end , by which notches , lying into each other , the sides of the house were held together at the corners .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 12]: I soon saw it must be a sort of roadside inn .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 51]: There was no one about the place , but passing through a dark vestibule , in which were stores of fodder and various utensils , I came to a room in which sat a mother and her daughter , the former spinning , the latter making lace on a pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 9]: In at the windows looked the great Jungfrau .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 25]: The room was lined with planks ; the floor was boarded ; the ceiling , too , was of boards -- pine-wood all around .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 7]: The women rose when I entered .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 29]: I knew enough of German to make them understand my story , and had learned enough of their _ patois _ to understand them a little in return .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 35]: They looked concerned , and the older woman passing her hands over my jacket , turned to her daughter and commenced a talk much too rapid and no doubt idiomatic for me to follow .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 18]: It was in the end mingled with much laughter , evidently at some proposal of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 18]: Then the daughter left the room , and the mother began to heap wood on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 22]: In a few minutes the daughter returned , still laughing , with some garments , which the mother took from her .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 18]: I was watching everything from a corner of the hearth , where I had seated myself wearily .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 50]: The mother came up to me , and , without speaking , put something over my head , which I found to be a short petticoat such as the women wore ; then told me I must take off my clothes , and have them dried at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 11]: She laid other garments on a chair beside me . '
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 14]: I do n't know how to put them on , ' I objected .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 25]: ` Put on as many as you can , ' she said laughing , ` and I will help you with the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 4]: I looked about .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 9]: There was a great press in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 28]: I went behind it and pulled off my clothes ; and having managed to put on some of the girl 's garments , issued from my concealment .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 37]: The kindly laughter was renewed , and mother and daughter busied themselves in arranging my apparel , evidently seeking to make the best of me as a girl , an attempt favoured by my pale face .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 75]: When I seemed to myself completely arrayed , the girl said to her mother what I took to mean , ` Let us finish what we have begun ; ' and leaving the room , returned presently with the velvet collar embroidered with silver and the pendent chains which the women of most of the cantons wear , and put it on me , hooking the chains and leaving them festooned under my arms .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 13]: The mother was spreading out my clothes before the fire to dry .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 11]: Neither was pretty , but both looked womanly and good .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 34]: The daughter had the attraction of youth and bright eyes ; the mother of goodwill and experience ; but both were sallow , and the mother very wrinkled for what seemed her years .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 19]: ` Now , ' I said , summoning my German , ` you 've almost finished your work .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 23]: Make my short hair as like your long hair as you can , and then I shall be a Swiss girl . '
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 27]: I was but a boy , and had no scruple concerning a bit of fun of which I might have been ashamed a few years later .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 13]: The girl took a comb from her own hair and arranged mine .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 32]: When she had finished , ` One girl may kiss another , ' I said ; and doubtless she understood me , for she returned my kiss with a fresh laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 29]: I sat down by the fire , and as its warmth crept into my limbs , I rejoiced over comforts which yesterday had been a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 10]: Meantime they were busy getting me something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 21]: Just as they were setting it on the table , however , a loud call outside took them both away .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 20]: In a few moments two other guests entered , and then first I found myself ashamed of my costume .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 28]: With them the mother re-entered , calling behind her , ` There 's nobody at home ; you must put the horses up yourself , Annel . '
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 17]: Then she moved the little table towards me , and proceeded to set out the meal .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 26]: I see you have got something to eat , ' said one of the strangers , in a voice I fancied I had heard before .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 9]: ` Will you please to share it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 15]: returned the woman , moving the table again towards the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 36]: I thought with myself that , if I kept silent , no one could tell I was not a girl ; and , the table being finally adjusted , I moved my seat towards it .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 21]: Meantime the man was helping his companion to take off her outer garments , and put them before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 15]: I saw the face of neither until they approached the table and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 45]: Great was my surprise to discover that the man was the same I had met in the wood on my way to Moldwarp Hall , and that the girl was Clara -- a good deal grown -- in fact , looking almost a woman .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 17]: From after facts , the meeting became less marvellous in my eyes than it then appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 29]: I felt myself in an awkward position -- indeed , I felt almost guilty , although any notion of having the advantage of them never entered my head .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 64]: I was more than half inclined to run out and help Annel with the horses , but I was very hungry , and not at all willing to postpone my meal , simple as it was -- bread and butter , eggs , cheese , milk , and a bottle of the stronger wine of the country , tasting like a coarse sherry .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 24]: The two -- father and daughter evidently -- talked about their journey , and hoped they should reach the Grindelwald without more rain .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 24]: ` By the way , ' said the gentleman , ` it 's somewhere not far from here young Cumbermede is at school .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 15]: I know Mr Forest well enough -- used to know him , at least .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 9]: We may as well call upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 14]: ` Cumbermede , ' said Clara ; ` who is he ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 26]: A nephew of Mrs Wilson 's -- no , not nephew -- second or third cousin -- or something of the sort , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 16]: -- Did n't somebody tell me you met him at the Hall one day ? '
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 8]: ` Oh , that boy -- Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 7]: Yes ; I told you myself .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 17]: Do n't you remember what a bit of fun we had the night of the ball ?
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 12]: We were shut out on the leads , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 12]: ` Yes , to be sure , you did tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 9]: What sort of a boy is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 5]: Much like other boys .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 18]: I did think he was a coward at first , but he showed some pluck at last .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 14]: I should n't wonder if he turns out a good sort of fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 9]: We _ were _ in a fix ! '
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 9]: ` You 're a terrible madcap , Clara !
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 20]: If you do n't settle down as you grow , you 'll be getting yourself into worse scrapes . '
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 18]: ` Not with you to look after me , papa dear , ' answered Clara , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: ` It was the fun of cheating old Goody Wilson , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 31]: Her father grinned with his whole mouthful of teeth , and looked at her with amusement -- almost sympathetic roguery , which she evidently appreciated , for she laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 7]: Meantime I was feeling very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 32]: Something within told me I had no right to overhear remarks about myself ; and , in my slow way , I was meditating how to get out of the scrape .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 9]: ` What a nice-looking girl that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 21]: said Clara , without lifting her eyes from her plate -- ' I mean for a Swiss , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 7]: But I do like the dress .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 16]: I wish you would buy me a collar and chains like those , papa . '
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 14]: ` Always wanting to get something out of your old dad , Clara !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 14]: Just like the rest of you , always wanting something -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 17]: ` No , papa ; it 's you gentlemen always want to keep everything for yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 8]: We only want you to share . '
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 16]: ` Well , you shall have the collar , and I shall have the chains .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 6]: -- Will that do ? '
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 16]: ` Yes , thank you , papa , ' she returned , nodding her head .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 13]: ` Meantime , had n't you better give me your diamond pin ?
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 10]: It would fasten this troublesome collar so nicely ! '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 6]: ` There , child ! '
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 11]: he answered , proceeding to take it from his shirt .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 5]: ` Anything else ? '
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 8]: ` No , no , papa dear .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 6]: I did n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 17]: I expected you , like everybody else , to decline carrying out your professed principles . '
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 17]: ` What a nice girl she is , ' I thought , ` after all ! '
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 30]: ` My love , ' said her father , ` you will know some day that I would do more for you even than give you my pet diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 27]: If you are a good girl , and do as I tell you , there will be grander things than diamond pins in store for you .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 10]: But you may have this if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 9]: He looked fondly at her as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 6]: ` Oh no , papa !
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 6]: -- not now at least .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 10]: I should not know what to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 9]: I should be sure to lose it . '
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 24]: If my clothes had been dry , I would have slipped away , put them on , and appeared in my proper guise .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 32]: As it was , I was getting more and more miserable -- ashamed of revealing who I was , and ashamed of hearing what the speakers supposed I did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 5]: I sat on irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 42]: In a little while , however , either the wine having got into my head , or the food and warmth having restored my courage , I began to contemplate the bolder stroke of suddenly revealing myself by some unexpected remark .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 15]: They went on talking about the country , and the road they had come .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 16]: ` But we have hardly seen anything worth calling a precipice , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 20]: ` You 'll see hundreds of them if you look out of the window , ' said her father .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 11]: but I do n't mean that , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 11]: ` It 's nothing to look at them like that .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 16]: I mean from the top of them -- to look down , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 13]: ` Like from the flying buttress at Moldwarp Hall , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 12]: The moment I began to speak , they began to stare .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 26]: Clara 's hand was arrested on its way towards the bread , and her father 's wine-glass hung suspended between the table and his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 3]: I laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 5]: ` By Jove ! '
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 31]: said Mr Coningham -- and added nothing , for amazement , but looked uneasily at his daughter , as if asking whether they had not said something awkward about me .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 6]: ` It 's Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 13]: exclaimed Clara , in the tone of one talking in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 11]: Then she laid down her knife , and laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 8]: ` What a guy you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 13]: ` Who would have thought of finding you in a Swiss girl ?
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 19]: Really it was too bad of you to sit there and let us go on as we did .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 11]: I do believe we were talking about your precious self !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 6]: At least papa was . '
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 7]: Again her merry laugh rang out .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: She could not have taken a better way of relieving us .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 29]: ` I 'm very sorry , ' I said ; ` but I felt so awkward in this costume that I could n't bring myself to speak before .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 6]: I tried very hard . '
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 5]: ` Poor boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 19]: she returned , rather more mockingly than I liked , her violets swimming in the dews of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 11]: By this time Mr Coningham had apparently recovered his self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 16]: I say _ apparently _ , for I doubt if he had ever lost it .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 40]: He had only , I think , been running over their talk in his mind to see if he had said anything unpleasant , and now , re-assured , I think , he stretched his hand across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 23]: ` At all events , Mr Cumbermede , ' he said , ' _ we _ owe _ you _ an apology .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 22]: I am sure we ca n't have said anything we should mind you hearing ; but -- ' ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 31]: I interrupted , ` you have told me nothing I did not know already , except that Mrs Wilson was a relation , of which I was quite ignorant . '
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 9]: ` It is true enough , though . '
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 10]: ` What relation is she , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 30]: I think , when I gather my recollections of the matter -- I think she was first cousin to your mother -- perhaps it was only second cousin . '
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 13]: ` Why should n't she have told me so , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: ` She must explain that herself .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 9]: _ I _ can not account for that .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 6]: It is very extraordinary . '
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 21]: ` But how do you know so well about me , sir -- if you do n't mind saying ? '
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 9]: I am an old friend of the family .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 11]: I knew your father better than your uncle , though .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 11]: Your uncle is not over-friendly , you see . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 7]: I am sorry for that . '
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: ` No occasion at all .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 8]: I suppose he does n't like me .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 20]: I fancy , being a Methodist -- ' ` My uncle is not a Methodist , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 9]: He goes to the parish church regularly . '
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 5]: it 's all one .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 25]: I only meant to say that , being a man of somewhat peculiar notions , I supposed he did not approve of my profession .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 24]: Your good people are just as ready as others , however , to call in the lawyer when they fancy their rights invaded .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 19]: But no one has a right to complain of another because he does n't choose to like him .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 9]: Besides , it brings grist to the mill .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 12]: If everybody liked everybody , what would become of the lawsuits ?
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 13]: And that would unsuit us -- would n't it , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 13]: ` You know , papa dear , what mamma would say ? '
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 11]: ` But she ai n't here , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 25]: ` But _ I _ am , papa ; and I do n't like to hear you talk shop , ' said Clara coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 9]: ` Very well ; we wo n't then .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 21]: But I was only explaining to Mr Cumbermede how I supposed it was that his uncle did not like me .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 14]: There was no offence in that , I hope , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 9]: ` Certainly not , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 6]: I am the only offender .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 11]: But I was innocent enough as far as intention goes .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 20]: I came in drenched and cold , and the good people here amused themselves dressing me like a girl .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 10]: It is quite time I were getting home now .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 10]: Mr Forest will be in a way about me .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 6]: So will Charley Osborne . '
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 23]: ` Oh yes , ' said Mr Coningham , ' I remember hearing you were at school together somewhere in this quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 7]: But tell us all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 7]: Did you lose your way ? '
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 6]: I told them my story .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 20]: Even Clara looked grave when I came to the incident of finding myself on the verge of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 8]: ` Thank God , my boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 5]: said Mr Coningham kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 8]: ` You have had a narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 17]: I lost myself once in the Cumberland hills , and hardly got off with my life .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 15]: Here it is a chance you were ever seen again , alive or dead .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 9]: I wonder you 're not knocked up . '
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: I was , however , more so than I knew .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 10]: ` How are you going to get home ? '
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 4]: he asked . '
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 13]: I do n't know any way but walking , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 9]: ` Are you far from home ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 13]: I dare say the people here will be able to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 13]: But I think you said you were going down into the Grindelwald .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 8]: I shall know where I am there .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 9]: Perhaps you will let me walk with you .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 11]: Horses ca n't go very fast along these roads . '
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 11]: ` You shall have my horse , my boy . '
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 8]: I could n't think of that . '
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 4]: ` You must .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 10]: I have n't been wandering all day like you .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 8]: You can ride , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 7]: ` Yes , pretty well . '
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 16]: ` Then you shall ride with Clara , and I 'll walk with the guide .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 11]: I shall go and see after the horses presently . '
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 11]: It was indeed a delightful close to a dreadful day .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 20]: We sat and chatted a while , and then Clara and I went out to look at the Jungfrau .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 25]: She told me they had left her mother at Interlaken , and had been wandering about the Bernese Alps for nearly a week . '
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 28]: I ca n't think what should have put it in papa 's head , ' she added ; ` for he does not care much for scenery .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 20]: I fancy he wants to make the most of poor me , and so takes me the grand tour .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 18]: He wanted to come without mamma , but she said we were not to be trusted alone .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 14]: She had to give in when we took to horseback , though . '
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 14]: It was getting late , and Mr Coningham came out to find us .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 13]: ` It is quite time we were going , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 9]: ` In fact we are too late now .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 14]: The horses are ready , and your clothes are dry , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 8]: I have felt them all over . '
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 9]: ` How kind of you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 3]: ` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 13]: Why should any one want another to get his death of cold ?
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 20]: If you are to keep alive , it 's better to keep well as long as ever you can .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: Make haste , though , and change your clothes . '
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 15]: I hurried away , followed by Clara 's merry laugh at my clumsy gait .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 8]: In a few moments I was ready .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 9]: Mr Coningham had settled my bill for me .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 29]: Mother and daughter gave me a kind farewell , and I exhausted my German in vain attempts to let them know how grateful I was for their goodness .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 14]: There was not much time , however , to spend even on gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 20]: The sun was nearly down , and I could see Clara mounted and waiting for me before the window .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 7]: I found Mr Coningham rather impatient .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 16]: ` Come along , Mr Cumbermede ; we must be off , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 6]: ` Get up there . '
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 17]: ` You _ have _ grown , though , after all , ' said Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 16]: I thought it might be only the petticoats that made you look so tall . '
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 27]: I got on the horse which the guide , a half-witted fellow from the next valley , was holding for me , and we set out .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 14]: The guide walked beside my horse , and Mr Coningham beside Clara 's .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 32]: The road was level for a little way , but it soon turned up on the hill where I had been wandering , and went along the steep side of it .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 11]: ` Will this do for a precipice , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 4]: said her father .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 15]: dear no , ' she answered ; ` it 's not worth the name .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 6]: It actually slopes outward . '
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 16]: ` Before we got down to the next level stretch it began again to rain .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 16]: A mist came on , and we could see but a little way before us .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 16]: Through the mist came the sound of the bells of the cattle upon the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: Our guide trudged carefully but boldly on .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 10]: He seemed to know every step of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 34]: Clara was very cool , her father a little anxious , and very attentive to his daughter , who received his help with a never-failing merry gratitude , making light of all annoyances .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 17]: At length we came down upon the better road , and travelled on with more comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 6]: ` Look , Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 9]: I said , ` will that do ? '
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 14]: she asked , turning her head in the direction in which I pointed .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 52]: On our right , through the veil , half of rain , half of gauzy mist , which filled the air , arose a precipice indeed -- the whole bulk it was of the Eiger mountain , which the mist brought so near that it seemed literally to overhang the road .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 14]: Clara looked up for a moment , but betrayed no sign of awe .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 13]: ` Yes , I think that will do , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 12]: ` Though you are only at the foot of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 3]: I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 17]: ` Yes , though I am only at the foot of it , ' she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: ` What does it remind you of ? '
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 3]: ` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 14]: I never saw anything it could remind me of , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 6]: ` Nor read anything ? '
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 7]: ` Not that I remember . '
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 15]: ` It reminds me of Mount Sinai in the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 32]: You remember Christian was afraid because the side of it which was next the wayside did hang so much over that he thought it would fall on his head . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 22]: I never read the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ , ' she returned , in a careless if not contemptuous tone .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 5]: ` Did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 11]: Oh , you would like it so much ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 7]: I do n't think I should .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 8]: I do n't like religious books . '
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 10]: ` But that is such a good story ! '
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 14]: it 's all a trap -- sugar on the outside of a pill !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 9]: The sting 's in the tail of it .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 6]: They 're all like that .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 7]: _ I _ know them . '
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 14]: This silenced me , and for a while we went on without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 22]: The rain ceased ; the mist cleared a little ; and I began to think I saw some landmarks I knew .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 12]: A moment more , and I perfectly understood where we were .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 17]: ` I 'm all right now , sir , ' I said to Mr Coningham . '
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 9]: I can find my way from here . '
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 11]: As I spoke I pulled up and proceeded to dismount .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: ` Sit still , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 14]: ` We can not do better than ride on to Mr Forest 's .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 34]: I do n't know him much , but I have met him , and in a strange country all are friends , I dare say he will take us in for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 10]: Do you think he could house us ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 7]: I have no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 12]: For that matter , the boys could crowd a little . '
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 8]: ` Is it far from here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 10]: ` Not above two miles , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 10]: ` Are you sure you know the way ? '
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 5]: ` Quite sure . '
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: ` Then you take the lead . '
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 4]: I did so .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 15]: He spoke to the guide , and Clara and I rode on in front .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 17]: ` You and I seem destined to have adventures together , Clara , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 5]: ` It seems so .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 20]: But this is not so much of an adventure as that night on the leads , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 18]: ` You would not have thought so if you had been with me in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 9]: ` Were you very much frightened ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 3]: I was .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: And then to think of finding you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 8]: ` It was funny , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 21]: When we reached the house , there was great jubilation over me , but Mr Forest himself was very serious .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 29]: He had not been back more than half an hour , and was just getting ready to set out again , accompanied by men from the village below .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 22]: Most of the boys were quite knocked up , for they had been looking for me ever since they missed me .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 7]: Charley was in a dreadful way .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 23]: When he saw me he burst into tears , and declared he would never let me go out of his sight again .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 28]: But if he had been with me , it would have been death to both of us : I could never have got him over the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 35]: Mr and Mrs Forest received their visitors with the greatest cordiality , and invited them to spend a day or two with them , to which , after some deliberation , Mr Coningham agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 4]: AGAIN THE ICE-CAVE .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 27]: The next morning he begged a holiday for me and Charley , of whose family he knew something , although he was not acquainted with them .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 46]: I was a little disappointed at Charley 's being included in the request , not in the least from jealousy , but because I had set my heart on taking Clara to the cave in the ice , which I knew Charley would not like .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 16]: But I thought we could easily arrange to leave him somewhere near until we returned .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 19]: I spoke to Mr Coningham about it , who entered into my small scheme with the greatest kindness .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 23]: Charley confided to me afterwards that he did not take to him -- he was too like an ape , he said .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 36]: But the impression of his ugliness had with me quite worn off ; and for his part , if I had been a favourite nephew , he could not have been more complaisant and hearty .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 24]: I felt very stiff when we set out , and altogether not quite myself ; but the discomfort wore off as we went .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 33]: Charley had Mr Coningham 's horse , and I walked by the side of Clara 's , eager after any occasion , if but a pretence , of being useful to her .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 13]: She was quite familiar with me , but seemed shy of Charley .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 70]: He looked much more of a man than I ; for not only , as I have said , had he grown much during his illness , but there was an air of troubled thoughtfulness about him which made him look considerably older than he really was ; while his delicate complexion and large blue eyes had a kind of mystery about them that must have been very attractive .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 30]: When we reached the village , I told Charley that we wanted to go on foot to the cave , and hoped he would not mind waiting our return .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 50]: But he refused to be left , declaring he should not mind going in the least ; that he was quite well now , and ashamed of his behaviour on the former occasion ; that , in fact , it must have been his approaching illness that caused it .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 10]: I could not insist , and we set out .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 21]: The footpath led us through fields of corn , with a bright sun overhead , and a sweet wind blowing .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 33]: It was a glorious day of golden corn , gentle wind , and blue sky -- with great masses of white snow , whiter than any cloud , held up in it .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 44]: We descended the steep bank ; we crossed the wooden bridge over the little river ; we crunched under our feet the hail-like crystals lying rough on the surface of the glacier ; we reached the cave , and entered its blue abyss .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 11]: I went first into the delicious , yet dangerous-looking blue .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 9]: The cave had several sharp angles in it .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 13]: When I reached the furthest corner I turned to look behind me .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 4]: I was alone .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 10]: I walked back and peeped round the last corner .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 22]: Between that and the one beyond it stood Clara and Charley -- staring at each other with faces of ghastly horror .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 16]: Clara 's look certainly could not have been the result of any excess of imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 13]: But many women respond easily to influences they could not have originated .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 74]: My conjecture is that the same horror had again seized upon Charley when he saw Clara ; that it made his face , already deathlike , tenfold more fearful ; that Clara took fright at his fear , her imagination opening like a crystal to the polarized light of reflected feeling ; and thus they stood in the paralysis of a dismay which ever multiplied itself in the opposed mirrors of their countenances .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 17]: I too was in terror -- for Charley , and certainly wasted no time in speculation .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 12]: I went forward instantly , and put an arm round each .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 13]: They woke up , as it were , and tried to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 9]: But the laugh was worse than the stare .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 8]: I hurried them out of the place .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 20]: We came upon Mr Coningham round the next corner , amusing himself with the talk of the half-silly guide .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 7]: ` Where are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 8]: ` Out again , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: ` The air is oppressive . '
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 4]: he said merrily .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 11]: ` The air is as pure as it is cold .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 17]: Come , Clara ; I want to explore the penetralia of this temple of Isis . '
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 7]: I believe he intended a pun .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 14]: Clara turned with him ; Charley and I went out into the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 9]: ` You should not have gone , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 11]: You have caught a chill again , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 12]: ` No , nothing of the sort , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 7]: ` Only it was too dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 4]: That lovely face !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 17]: To see it like that -- and know that is what it is coming to ! '
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 12]: ` You looked as horrid yourself , ' I returned . '
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 6]: I do n't doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 4]: We all did .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 4]: But why ? '
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 13]: ` Why , just because of the blueness , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 9]: ` Yes -- the blueness , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 9]: But there it was , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 5]: Clara came out smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 6]: All her horror had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 13]: I was looking into the hole as she turned the last corner .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 53]: When she first appeared , her face was ` like one that hath been seven days drowned ; ' but as she advanced , the decay thinned , and the life grew , until at last she stepped from the mouth of the sepulchre in all the glow of her merry youth .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 9]: It was a dumb show of the resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 27]: As we went back to the inn , Clara , who was walking in front with her father , turned her head and addressed me suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 12]: ` You see it was all a sham , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 6]: ` What was a sham ?
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 12]: I do n't know what you mean , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 13]: ` Why that , ' she returned , pointing with her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 25]: Then addressing her father , ` Is n't that the Eiger , ' she asked -- ` the same we rode under yesterday ? '
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 11]: ` To be sure it is , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 6]: She turned again to me .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 9]: ` You see it is all a sham !
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 23]: Last night it pretended to be on the very edge of the road and hanging over our heads at an awful height .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 22]: Now it has gone a long way back , is not so very high , and certainly does not hang over .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 11]: I ought not to have been satisfied with that precipice .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 6]: It took me in . '
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 7]: I did not reply at once .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 35]: Clara 's words appeared to me quite irreverent , and I recoiled from the very thought that there could be any sham in nature ; but what to answer her I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 24]: I almost began to dislike her ; for it is often incapacity for defending the faith they love which turns men into persecutors .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 17]: Seeing me foiled , Charley advanced with the doubtful aid of a sophism to help me .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 10]: ` Which is the sham , Miss Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 7]: ` That Eiger mountain there . '
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 5]: so I thought . '
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 12]: ` Then you are of my opinion , Mr Osborne ? '
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 22]: ` You mean the mountain is shamming , do n't you -- looking far off when really it is near ? '
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 18]: When it looked last night as if it hung right over our heads , it was shamming .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 9]: See it now -- far away there ! '
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 16]: ` But which , then , is the sham , and which is the true ?
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 16]: It _ looked _ near yesterday , and now it _ looks _ far away .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 5]: Which is which ? '
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 34]: ` It must have been a sham yesterday ; for although it looked near , it was very dull and dim , and you could only see the sharp outline of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 10]: ` Just so I argue on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 32]: The mountain must be shamming now , for although it looks so far off , it yet shows a most contradictory clearness -- not only of outline but of surface . '
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 11]: thought I , ` Miss Clara has found her match .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 15]: They both know he is talking nonsense , yet she ca n't answer him .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 20]: What she was saying was nonsense too , but I ca n't answer it either -- not yet . '
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 25]: I felt proud of both of them , but of Charley especially , for I had had no idea he could be so quick .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 14]: ` What ever put such an answer into your head , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 11]: it 's not quite original , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 21]: I believe it was suggested by two or three lines I read in a review just before we left home .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 8]: They took hold of me rather . '
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 20]: He repeated half of the now well-known little poem of Shelley , headed _ Passage of the Apennines _ .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 23]: He had forgotten the name of the writer , and it was many years before I fell in with the lines myself .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 51]: ` The Apennine in the light of day Is a mighty mountain dim and gray , Which between the earth and sky doth lay ; But when night comes , a chaos dread On the dim starlight then is spread , And the Apennine walks abroad with the storm . '
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 19]: In the middle of it I saw Clara begin to titter , but she did not interrupt him .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 34]: When he had finished , she said with a grave face , too grave for seriousness : ` Will you repeat the third line -- I think it was , Mr Osborne ? '
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 4]: He did so .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 14]: ` What kind of eggs did the Apennine lay , Mr Osborne ? '
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 7]: she asked , still perfectly serious .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 21]: Charley was abashed to find she could take advantage of probably a provincialism to turn into ridicule such fine verses .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 15]: Before he could recover himself , she had planted another blow ' or two .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: ` And where is its nest ? '
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 9]: Between the earth and the sky is vague .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 14]: But then to be sure it must want a good deal of room .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 19]: And after all , a mountain is a strange fowl , and who knows where it might lay ?
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 9]: Between earth and sky is quite definite enough ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 15]: Besides , the bird-nesting boys might be dangerous if they knew where it was .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 10]: It would be such a find for them ! '
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: My champion was defeated .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 14]: Without attempting a word in reply , he hung back and dropped behind .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 14]: Mr Coningham must have heard the whole , but he offered no remark .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 18]: I saw that Charley 's sensitive nature was hurt , and my heart was sore for him .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 14]: ` That 's too bad of you , Clara , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 11]: ` What 's too bad of me , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 16]: I hesitated a moment , then answered -- ` To make game of such verses .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 13]: Any one with half a soul must see they were fine . '
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 42]: ` Very wrong of you , indeed , my dear , ' said Mr Coningham from behind , in a voice that sounded as if he were smothering a laugh ; but when I looked round , his face was grave .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 16]: ` Then I suppose that half soul I have n't got , ' returned Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 13]: I did n't mean that , ' I said , lamely enough .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 16]: ` But there 's no logic in that kind of thing , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 17]: ` You see , papa , ' said Clara , ` what you are accountable for .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 11]: Why did n't you make them teach me logic ? '
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 7]: Her father smiled a pleased smile .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 16]: His daughter 's naiveté would in his eyes make up for any lack of logic .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 17]: ` Mr Osborne , ' continued Clara , turning back , ' I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 16]: I am a woman , and you men do n't allow us to learn logic .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 17]: But at the same time you must confess you were making a bad use of yours .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 18]: You know it was all nonsense you were trying to pass off on me for wisdom . '
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 12]: He was by her side the instant she spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 24]: A smile grew upon his face ; I could see it growing , just as you see the sun growing behind a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 10]: In a moment it broke out in radiance . '
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 8]: I confess , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 22]: I thought you were too hard on Wilfrid ; and he had n't anything at hand to say for himself . '
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 13]: ` And you were too hard upon me , were n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 13]: Two to one is not fair play -- is it now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 7]: ` No ; certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 13]: ` And that justified a little false play on my part ? '
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 16]: ` No , it did _ not _ , ' said Charley , almost fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 7]: ` Nothing justifies false play . '
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 9]: ` Not even yours , Mr Osborne ? '
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 25]: replied Clara , with a stately coldness quite marvellous in one so young ; and leaving him , she came again to my side .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 19]: I peeped at Mr Coningham , curious to see how he regarded all this wrangling with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 8]: He appeared at once amused and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 21]: Clara 's face was in a glow , clearly of anger at the discourteous manner in which Charley had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 15]: ` You must n't be angry with Charley , Clara , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 11]: ` He is very rude , ' she replied indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 18]: ` What he said was rude , I allow , but Charley himself is anything but rude .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 19]: I have n't looked at him , but I am certain he is miserable about it already . '
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 7]: ` So he ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 18]: To speak like that to a lady , when her very friendliness put her off her guard !
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 11]: I never was treated so in all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 14]: She spoke so loud that she must have meant Charley to hear her .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 34]: But when I looked back , I saw that he had fallen a long way behind , and was coming on very slowly , with dejected look and his eyes on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 10]: Mr Coningham did not interfere by word or sign .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 22]: When we reached the inn he ordered some refreshment , and behaved to us both as if we were grown men .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 16]: Just a touch of familiarity was the sole indication that we were not grown men .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 25]: Boys are especially grateful for respect from their superiors , for it helps them to respect themselves ; but Charley sat silent and gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 26]: As he would not ride back , and Mr Coningham preferred walking too , I got into the saddle and rode by Clara 's side .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 25]: As we approached the house , Charley crept up the other side of Clara 's horse , and laid his hand on his mane .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 20]: When he spoke Clara started , for she was looking the other way and had not observed his approach .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 18]: ` Miss Clara , ' he said , ' I am very sorry I was so rude .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 6]: Will you forgive me ? '
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 27]: Instead of being hard to reconcile , as I had feared from her outburst of indignation , she leaned forward and laid her hand on his .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 21]: He looked up in her face , his own suffused with a colour I had never seen in it before .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 15]: His great blue eyes lightened with thankfulness , and began to fill with tears .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 9]: How she looked , I could not see .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 11]: She withdrew her hand , and Charley dropped behind again .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 15]: In a little while he came up to my side , and began talking .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 14]: He soon got quite merry , but Clara in her turn was silent .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 14]: I doubt if anything would be worth telling but for what comes after .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 19]: History itself would be worthless but for what it can not tell , namely , its own future .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 18]: Upon this ground my reader must excuse the apparent triviality of the things I am now relating .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 40]: When we were alone in our room that night -- for ever since Charley 's illness we two had had a room to ourselves -- Charley said , ' I behaved like a brute this morning , Wilfrid . '
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 15]: ` No , Charley ; you were only a little rude from being over-eager .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 27]: If she had been seriously advocating dishonesty , you would have been quite right to take it up so ; and you thought she was . '
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 11]: ` Yes ; but it was very silly of me .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 15]: I dare say it was because I had been so dishonest myself just before .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 25]: How dreadful it is that I am always taking my own side , even when I do what I am ashamed of in another !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 21]: I suppose I think I have got my horse by the head , and the other has not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 9]: That may be it , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 19]: ` I 'm afraid I ca n't think about it to-night , for I do n't feel well .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 15]: What if it should be your turn to nurse me now , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 17]: He turned quite pale , his eyes opened wide , and he looked at me anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 13]: Before morning I was aching all over : I had rheumatic fever .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 4]: CHARLEY NURSES ME .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 7]: I saw no more of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 13]: Mr Coningham came to bid me good-bye , and spoke very kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 31]: Mr Forest would have got a nurse for me , but Charley begged so earnestly to be allowed to return the service I had done for him that he yielded .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 11]: I was in great pain for more than a week .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: Charley 's attentions were unremitting .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 27]: In fact he nursed me more like a woman than a boy ; and made me think with some contrition how poor my ministrations had been .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 21]: Even after the worst was over , if I but moved , he was at my bedside in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 8]: Certainly no nurse could have surpassed him .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 46]: I could bear no one to touch me but him : from any one else I dreaded torture ; and my medicine was administered to the very moment by my own old watch , which had been brought to do its duty at least respectably .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 22]: One afternoon , finding me tolerably comfortable , he said , ` Shall I read something to you , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 14]: He never called me Willie , as most of my friends did . '
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 9]: I should like it , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 7]: ` What shall I read ? '
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 20]: ` Had n't you something in your head , ' I rejoined , ` when you proposed it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 18]: ` Well , I had ; but I do n't know if you would like it . '
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 11]: ` What did you think of , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 11]: I thought of a chapter in the New Testament . '
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 12]: ` How could you think I should not like that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 11]: ` Because I never saw you say your prayers . '
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 6]: ` That is quite true .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 20]: But you do n't think I never say my prayers , although you never see me do it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 23]: The fact was , my uncle , amongst his other peculiarities , did not approve of teaching children to say their prayers .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 26]: But he did not therefore leave me without instruction in the matter of praying -- either the idlest or the most availing of human actions .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 29]: He would say , ` When you want anything , ask for it , Willie ; and if it is worth your having , you will have it .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 15]: But do n't fancy you are doing God any service by praying to him .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 19]: He likes you to pray to him because he loves you , and wants you to love him .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 18]: And whatever you do , do n't go saying a lot of words you do n't mean .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 21]: If you think you ought to pray , say your Lord 's Prayer , and have done with it . '
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 52]: I had no theory myself on the matter ; but when I was in misery on the wild mountains , I had indeed prayed to God ; and had even gone so far as to hope , when I got what I prayed for , that he had heard my prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 5]: Charley made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 21]: ` It seems to me better that sort of thing should n't be seen , Charley , ' I persisted .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 17]: ` Perhaps , Wilfrid ; but I was taught to say my prayers regularly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 13]: I do n't think much of that either , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 17]: ` But I 've said a good many prayers since I 've been here , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 41]: I ca n't say I 'm sure it 's of any use , but I ca n't help trying after something -- I do n't know what -- something I want , and do n't know how to get . '
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 21]: ` But it 's only the prayer of faith that 's heard -- do you believe , Wilfrid ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: I dare n't say I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 8]: I wish I could say I do .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 10]: But I dare say things will be considered . '
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 14]: ` Would n't it be grand if it was true , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 6]: ` What , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 22]: ` That God actually let his creatures see him -- and -- all that came of it , you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 7]: ` It would be grand indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 23]: But supposing it true , how could we be expected to believe it like them that saw him with their own eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 20]: _ I _ could n't be required to believe just as if I could have no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 6]: It would n't be fair .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 15]: Only -- perhaps we have n't got the clew by the right end . '
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: ` Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 8]: But sometimes I hate the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 53]: And then again I feel as if I _ must _ read all about it ; not that I care for it exactly , but because a body must do something -- because -- I do n't know how to say it -- because of the misery , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 11]: I do n't know that I do know -- quite .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 29]: But now you have started the subject , I thought that was great nonsense Mr Forest was talking about the authority of the Church the other day . '
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 11]: ` Well , _ I _ thought so , too .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 22]: I do n't see what right they have to say so and so , if they did n't hear him speak .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 16]: As to what he meant , they may be right or they may be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 23]: If they _ have _ the gift of the Spirit , as they say -- how am I to tell they have ?
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 11]: All impostors claim it as well as the true men .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 65]: If I had ever so little of the same gift myself , I suppose I could tell ; but they say no one has till he believes -- so they may be all humbugs for anything I can possibly tell ; or they may be all true men , and yet I may fancy them all humbugs , and ca n't help it . '
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 29]: I was quite as much astonished to hear Charley talk in this style as some readers will be doubtful whether a boy could have talked such good sense .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 9]: I said nothing , and a silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 13]: ` Would you like me to read to you , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 28]: ` Yes , I should ; for , do you know , after all , I do n't think there 's anything like the New Testament . '
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 6]: ` Anything like it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 4]: he repeated . '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 5]: I should think not !
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 11]: Only I wish I did know what it all meant .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 21]: I wish I could talk to my father as I would to Jesus Christ if I saw _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 15]: But if I could talk to my father , he would n't understand me .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 30]: He would speak to me as if I were the very scum of the universe for daring to have a doubt of what _ he _ told me . '
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 14]: ` But he does n't mean _ himself _ , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 8]: ` Well , who told him ? '
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 5]: ` The Bible . '
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 8]: ` And who told the Bible ? '
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 7]: ` God , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 9]: ` But how am I to know that ?
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 8]: I only know that they say so .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 39]: Do you know , Wilfrid -- I _ do n't _ believe my father is quite sure himself , and that is what makes him in such a rage with anybody who does n't think as he does .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 12]: He 's afraid it may n't be true after all . '
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 29]: I had never had a father to talk to , but I thought something must be wrong when a boy _ could n't _ talk to his father .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 11]: My uncle was a better father than that came to .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 16]: Another pause followed , during which Charley searched for a chapter to fit the mood .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 27]: I will not say what chapter he found , for , after all , I doubt if we had any real notion of what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 47]: I know , however , that there were words in it which found their way to my conscience ; and , let men of science or philosophy say what they will , the rousing of a man 's conscience is the greatest event in his existence .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 16]: In such a matter , the consciousness of the man himself is the sole witness .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 37]: A Chinese can expose many of the absurdities and inconsistencies of the English : it is their own Shakspere who must bear witness to their sins and faults , as well as their truths and characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 20]: After this we had many conversations about such things , one of which I shall attempt to report by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 22]: Of course , in any such attempt all that can be done is to put the effect into fresh conversational form .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 37]: What I have just written must at least be more orderly than what passed between us ; but the spirit is much the same , and mere fact is of consequence only as it affects truth .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 3]: A DREAM .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 17]: The best immediate result of my illness was that I learned to love Charley Osborne dearly .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 24]: We renewed an affection resembling from afar that of Shakspere for his nameless friend ; we anticipated that informing _ In Memoriam _ .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 26]: Lest I be accused of infinite arrogance , let me remind my reader that the sun is reflected in a dewdrop as in the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 20]: One night I had a strange dream , which is perhaps worth telling for the involution of its consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: I thought I was awake in my bed , and Charley asleep in his .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 7]: I lay looking into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 7]: It began to waver and change .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 13]: The night-light enlarged and receded ; and the walls trembled and waved .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 12]: The light had got behind them , and shone through them .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 3]: Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 9]: I cried ; for I was frightened . '
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 31]: I heard him move : but before he reached me , I was lying on a lawn , surrounded by trees , with the moon shining through them from behind .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 9]: The next moment Charley was by my side .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 7]: ` Is n't it prime ? '
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 7]: ` It 's all over . '
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 9]: ` What do you mean , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 9]: I mean that we 're both dead now .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 11]: It 's not so very bad -- is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 6]: ` Nonsense , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 11]: I returned ; ' _ I _ 'm not dead .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 10]: I 'm as wide alive as ever I was .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 4]: Look here . '
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 16]: So saying , I sprung to my feet , and drew myself up before him .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 8]: ` Where 's your worst pain ? '
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 11]: said Charley , with a curious expression in his tone .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 7]: ` Here , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 13]: ` No ; it 's not ; it 's in my back .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 6]: No , it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 4]: It 's nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 8]: I have n't got any pain . '
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 13]: Charley laughed a low laugh , which sounded as sweet as strange .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 39]: It was to the laughter of the world ` as moonlight is to sunlight , ' but not ` as water is to wine , ' for what it had lost in sound it had gained in smile .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 10]: ` Tell me now you 're not dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 4]: he exclaimed triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 16]: ` But , ' I insisted , ` do n't you see I 'm alive ?
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 23]: _ You _ may be dead for anything I know -- but I _ am not _ -- I know that . '
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 14]: ` You 're just as dead as I am , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 5]: ` Look here . '
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 25]: A little way off , in an open plot by itself , stood a little white rose tree , half mingled with the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 24]: Charley went up to it , stepped on the topmost twig , and stood : the bush did not even bend under him .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 8]: ` Very well , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 8]: ` You are dead , I confess .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 8]: But now , look you here . '
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 47]: I went to a red rose-bush which stood at some distance , blanched in the moon , set my foot on the top of it , and made as if I would ascend , expecting to crush it , roses and all , to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 3]: But behold !
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 14]: I was standing on my red rose opposite Charley on his white . '
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 27]: I told you so , ' he cried , across the moonlight , and his voice sounded as if it came from the moon far away .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 5]: ` Oh Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 10]: I cried , ` I 'm so frightened ! '
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 8]: ` What are you frightened at ? '
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 4]: ` At you .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 8]: You 're dead , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 41]: ` It is a good thing , Wilfrid , ' he rejoined , in a tone of some reproach , ` that I am not frightened at you for the same reason ; for what would happen then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 16]: I suppose you would go away and leave me alone in this ghostly light . '
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 25]: ` If I were frightened at you as you are at me , we should not be able to see each other at all .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 10]: If you take courage the light will grow . '
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 21]: ` Do n't leave me , Charley , ' I cried , and flung myself from my tree towards his .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 11]: I found myself floating , half reclined on the air .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 11]: We met midway each in the other 's arms . '
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 11]: I do n't know where I am , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 9]: ` That is my father 's rectory . '
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 13]: He pointed to the house , which I had not yet observed .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 16]: It lay quite dark in the moonlight , for not a window shone from within .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 9]: ` Do n't leave me , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 4]: ` Leave you !
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 7]: I should think not , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 10]: I have been long enough without you already . '
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 12]: ` Have you been long dead , then , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 5]: ` Not very long .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 6]: Yes , a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 9]: But , indeed , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 12]: We do n't count time as we used to count it .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 10]: -- I want to go and see my father .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 12]: It is long since I saw _ him _ , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 5]: Will you come ? '
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 27]: ` If you think I might -- if you wish it , ' I said , for I had no great desire to see Mr Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 11]: ` Perhaps he wo n't care to see me . '
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 14]: ` Perhaps not , ' said Charley , with another low silvery laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 5]: ` Come along . '
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 6]: We glided over the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 11]: A window stood a little open on the second floor .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 16]: We floated up , entered , and stood by the bedside of Charley 's father .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 7]: He lay in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 3]: ` Father !
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 3]: father ! '
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 17]: said Charley , whispering in his ear as he lay -- ` it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 11]: You need not be troubled about me any more . '
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 7]: Mr Osborne turned on his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 12]: ` He 's dreaming about us now , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 11]: ` He sees us both standing by his bed . '
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 40]: But the next moment Mr Osborne sat up , stretched out his arms towards us with the open palms outwards , as if pushing us away from him , and cried , ` Depart from me , all evil-doers .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 3]: O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 10]: do I not hate them that hate thee ? '
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 14]: He followed with other yet more awful words which I never could recall .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 13]: I only remember the feeling of horror and amazement they left behind .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 5]: I turned to Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 16]: He had disappeared , and I found myself lying in the bed beside Mr Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 26]: I gave a great cry of dismay -- when there was Charley again beside me , saying , ` What 's the matter , Wilfrid ?
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 3]: Wake up .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 7]: My father 's not here . '
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 25]: I did wake , but until I had felt in the bed I could not satisfy myself that Mr Osborne was indeed not there .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 9]: ` You 've been talking in your sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 18]: I could hardly get you waked , ' said Charley , who stood there in his shirt .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 5]: ` Oh Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 12]: I cried , ` I 've had such a dream ! '
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 8]: ` What was it , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 12]: I ca n't talk about it yet , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 23]: I never did tell him that dream ; for even then I was often uneasy about him -- he was so sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 18]: The affections of my friend were as hoops of steel ; his feelings a breath would ripple .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 5]: Oh , my Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 25]: if ever we meet in that land so vaguely shadowed in my dream , will you not know that I loved you heartily well ?
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 19]: Shall I not hasten ' to lay bare my heart before you -- the priest of its confessional ?
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 4]: Oh , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 42]: when the truth is known , the false will fly asunder as the Autumn leaves in the wind ; but the true , whatever their faults , will only draw together the more tenderly that they have sinned against each other .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 4]: THE FROZEN STREAM .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 20]: Before the Winter arrived , I was well , and Charley had recovered from the fatigue of watching me .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 24]: One holiday , he and I set out alone to accomplish a scheme we had cherished from the first appearance of the frost .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 46]: How it arose I hardly remember ; I think it came of some remark Mr Forest had made concerning the difference between the streams of Switzerland and England -- those in the former country being emptiest , those in the latter fullest in the Winter .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 61]: It was -- when the frost should have bound up the sources of the beck which ran almost by our door , and it was no longer a stream , but a rope of ice -- to take that rope for our guide , and follow it as far as we could towards the secret recesses of its Summer birth .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 35]: Along the banks of the stream , we followed it up and up , meeting a varied loveliness which it would take the soul of a Wordsworth or a Ruskin to comprehend or express .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 15]: To my poor faculty the splendour of the ice-crystals remains the one memorial thing .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 20]: In those lonely water-courses the sun was gloriously busy , with none to praise him except Charley and me .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 30]: Where the banks were difficult we went down into the frozen bed , and there had story above story of piled-up loveliness , with opal and diamond cellars below .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 11]: Spikes and stars crystalline radiated and refracted and reflected marvellously .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 53]: But we did not reach the primary source of the stream by miles ; we were stopped by a precipitous rock , down the face of which one half of the stream fell , while the other crept out of its foot , from a little cavernous opening about four feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 16]: Charley was a few yards ahead of me , and ran stooping into the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 3]: I followed .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 32]: But when I had gone as far as I dared for the darkness and the down-sloping roof , and saw nothing of him , I grew dismayed , and called him .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 11]: With a thrill of horror my dream returned upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 11]: I got on my hands and knees and crept forward .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 32]: A short way further the floor sank -- only a little , I believe , but from the darkness I took the descent for an abyss into which Charley had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 15]: I gave a shriek of despair , and scrambled out of the cave howling .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 9]: In a moment he was by my side .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 11]: He had only crept behind a projection for a trick .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 5]: His remorse was extreme .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 10]: He begged my pardon in the most agonized manner .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 18]: ` Never mind , Charley , ' I said ; ` you did n't mean it . '
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 12]: ` Yes , I did mean it , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 23]: ` The temptation came , and I yielded ; only I did not know how dreadful it would be to you . '
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 5]: ` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 11]: You would n't have done it if you had . '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 10]: ` How am I to know that , Wilfrid ?
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 6]: I might have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 27]: Is n't it frightful that a body may go on and on till a thing is done , and then wish he had n't done it ?
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 6]: I am a despicable creature .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 24]: Do you know , Wilfrid , I once shot a little bird -- for no good , but just to shoot at something .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 16]: It was n't that I did n't think of it -- do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 6]: I did think of it .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 6]: I knew it was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 20]: When I had levelled my gun , I thought of it quite plainly , and yet drew the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 9]: It dropped , a heap of ruffled feathers .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 12]: I shall never get that little bird out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 27]: And the worst of it is that to all eternity I can never make any atonement ' ` But God will forgive you , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 25]: ` What do I care for that , ' he rejoined , almost fiercely , ` when the little bird can not forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 47]: -- I would go on my knees to the little bird , if I could , to beg its pardon and tell it-what a brute I was , and it might shoot me if it would , and I should say `` Thank you . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 13]: He laughed almost hysterically , and the tears ran down his face .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 17]: I have said little about my uncle 's teaching , lest I should bore my readers .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 14]: But there it came in , and therefore here it must come in .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 46]: My uncle had , by no positive instruction , but by occasional observations , not one of which I can recall , generated in me a strong hope that the life of the lower animals was terminated at their death no more than our own .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 88]: The man who believes that thought is the result of brain , and not the growth of an unknown seed whose soil is the brain , may well sneer at this , for he is to himself but a peck of dust that has to be eaten by the devouring jaws of Time ; but I can not see how the man who believes in soul at all , can say that the spirit of a man lives , and that the spirit of his horse dies .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 40]: I do not profess to believe anything for _ certain sure _ myself , but I do think that he who , if from merely philosophical considerations , believes the one , ought to believe the other as well .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 8]: Much more must the theosophist believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 25]: But I had never felt the need of the doctrine until I beheld the misery of Charley over the memory of the dead sparrow .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 14]: Surely that sparrow fell not to the ground without the Father 's knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 20]: how do you know , ' I said , ` that you can never beg the bird 's pardon ?
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 21]: If God made the bird , do you fancy with your gun you could destroy the making of his hand ?
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 25]: If he said , `` Let there be , '' do you suppose you could say , `` There shall not be '' ? '
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 16]: -LRB- Mr Forest had read that chapter of first things at morning prayers . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 25]: I fancy myself that for God to put a bird all in the power of a silly thoughtless boy -- ' ` Not thoughtless !
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 3]: not thoughtless !
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 6]: There is the misery ! '
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 18]: But I went on -- ' -- would be worse than for you to shoot it . '
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 17]: A great glow of something I dare not attempt to define grew upon Charley 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 16]: It was like what I saw on it when Clara laid her hand on his .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 35]: But presently it died out again , and he sighed -- ` If there _ were _ a God -- that is , if I were sure there was a God , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 5]: I could not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 4]: How could I ?
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 20]: _ I _ had never seen God , as the old story says Moses did on the clouded mountain .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 16]: All I could return was , ` Suppose there should be a God , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 10]: -- Might n't there be a God ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 17]: ` How should _ I _ know whether there _ might _ be a God ? '
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 13]: ` But _ may _ there not be a _ might be ?
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 5]: _ ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 5]: ` There may be .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 9]: How should I say the other thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 13]: I do not mean this was exactly what he or I said .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 23]: Unable to recall the words themselves , I put the sense of the thing in as clear a shape as I can .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 22]: We were seated upon a stone in the bed of the stream , off which the sun had melted the ice .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 10]: The bank rose above us , but not far .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: I thought I heard a footstep .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 9]: I jumped up , but saw no one .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 24]: I ran a good way up the stream to a place where I could climb the bank ; but then saw no one .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 21]: The footstep , real or imagined , broke our conversation at that point , and we did not resume it .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 39]: All that followed was -- ` If I were the sparrow , Charley , I would not only forgive you , but haunt you for ever out of gratitude that you were sorry you had killed me . '
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 13]: ` Then you _ do _ forgive me for frightening you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 4]: he said eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 20]: Very likely Charley and I resembled each other too much to be the best possible companions for each other .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 22]: There was , however , this difference between us -- that he had been bored with religion and I had not .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 19]: In other words , food had been forced upon him , which had only been laid before me .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 6]: We rose and went home .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 18]: A few minutes after our entrance , Mr Forest came in -- looking strange , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 27]: The conviction crossed my mind that it was his footstep we had heard over our heads as we sat in the channel of the frozen stream .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 15]: I have reason to think that he followed us for a chance of listening .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 33]: Something had set him on the watch -- most likely the fact that we were so much together , and did not care for the society of the rest of our schoolfellows .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 16]: From that time , certainly , he regarded Charley and myself with a suspicious gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 23]: We felt it , but beyond talking to each other about it , and conjecturing its cause , we could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 42]: It made Charley very unhappy at times , deepening the shadow which brooded over his mind ; for his moral skin was as sensitive to changes in the moral atmosphere as the most sensitive of plants to those in the physical .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 22]: But unhealthy conditions in the smallest communities can not last long without generating vapours which result in some kind of outburst .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 17]: The other boys , naturally enough , were displeased with us for holding so much together .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 25]: They attributed it to some fancy of superiority , whereas there was nothing in it beyond the simplest preference for each other 's society .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 19]: We were alike enough to understand each other , and unlike enough to interest and aid each other .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 19]: Besides , we did not care much for the sports in which boys usually explode their superfluous energy .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 13]: I preferred a walk and a talk with Charley to anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 14]: I may here mention that these talks had nearly cured me of castle-building .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 12]: To spin yarns for Charley 's delectation would have been absurd .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 8]: He cared for nothing but the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 12]: And yet he could never assure himself that anything was true .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 51]: The more likely a thing looked to be true , the more anxious was he that it should be unassailable ; and his fertile mind would in as many moments throw a score of objections at it , looking after each with eager eyes as if pleading for a refutation .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 17]: It was the very love of what was good that generated in him doubt and anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 33]: When our schoolfellows perceived that Mr Forest also was dissatisfied with us , their displeasure grew to indignation ; and we did not endure its manifestations without a feeling of reflex defiance .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 3]: AN EXPLOSION .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 13]: One Spring morning we had got up early and sauntered out together .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 9]: I remember perfectly what our talk was about .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 28]: Charley had started the question : ` How could it be just to harden Pharaoh 's heart and then punish him for what came of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 42]: I who had been brought up without any superstitious reverence for the Bible , suggested that the narrator of the story might be accountable for the contradiction , and simply that it was not true that God hardened Pharaoh 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 11]: Strange to say , Charley was rather shocked at this .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 22]: He had as yet received the dogma of the infallibility of the Bible without thinking enough about it to question it .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 41]: Nor did it now occur to him what a small affair it was to find a book fallible , compared with finding the God of whom the book spoke fallible upon its testimony -- for such was surely the dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 49]: Men have been able to exist without a Bible : if there be a God it must be in and through Him that all men live ; only if he be not true , then in Him , and not in the first Adam , all men die .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 29]: We were talking away about this , no doubt after a sufficiently crude manner , as we approached the house , unaware that we had lingered too long .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 13]: The boys were coming out from breakfast for a game before school .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 23]: Amongst them was one of the name of Home , who considered himself superior , from his connection with the Scotch Homes .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 26]: He was a big , strong , pale-faced , handsome boy , with the least bit of a sneer always hovering upon his upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 19]: Charley was half a head shorter than he , and I was half a head shorter than Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 26]: As we passed him , he said aloud , addressing the boy next him -- ` There they go -- a pair of sneaks ! '
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 13]: Charley turned upon him at once , his face in a glow .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 15]: ` Home , ' he said , ` no gentleman would say so . '
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 6]: ` And why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 14]: said Home , turning and striding up to Charley in a magnificent manner .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 14]: ` Because there is no ground for the assertion , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 13]: ` Then you mean to say I am a liar ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 36]: I mean to say , ' returned Charley , with more promptitude than I could have expected of him , ` that if you are a gentleman , you will be sorry for it . '
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 9]: ` There is my apology , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 18]: said Home , and struck Charley a blow on the head which laid him on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 12]: I believe he repented it the moment he had done it .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 24]: I caught one glimpse of the blood pouring over the transparent blue-veined skin , and rushed at Home in a transport of fury .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 37]: I never was brave one step beyond being able to do what must be done and bear what must be borne ; and now it was not courage that inspired me , but a righteous wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 28]: I did my best , got a good many hard blows , and planted not one in return , for I had never fought in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 11]: I do believe Home spared me , conscious of wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 14]: Meantime some of them had lifted Charley and carried him into the house .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 46]: Before I was thoroughly mauled , which must have been the final result , for I would not give in , the master appeared , and in a voice such as I had never heard from him before , ordered us all into the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 6]: ` Fighting like bullies ! '
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 10]: I thought my pupils were gentlemen at least ! '
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 49]: Perhaps dimly aware that he had himself given some occasion to this outbreak , and imagining in his heart a show of justice , he seized Home by the collar , and gave him a terrible cut with the riding-whip which he had caught up in his anger .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 15]: Home cried out , and the same moment Charley appeared , pale as death .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 6]: ` Oh , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 22]: he said , laying his hand on the master 's arm appealingly , ' I was to blame too . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 12]: I do n't doubt it , ' returned Mr Forest . '
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 7]: I shall settle with you presently .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 4]: Get away ! '
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 31]: ` Now , sir , ' he continued , turning to me -- and held the whip suspended , as if waiting a word from me to goad him on .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 11]: He looked something else than a gentleman himself just then .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 11]: It was a sudden outbreak of the beast in him .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 16]: ` Will you tell me why you punish me , sir , if you please ?
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 6]: What have I done ? '
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 21]: His answer was such a stinging blow that for a moment I was bewildered , and everything reeled about me .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 20]: But I did not cry out -- I know that , for I asked two of the fellows after .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 7]: ` You prate about justice ! '
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 15]: I will let you know what justice means -- to you at least . '
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 12]: And down came a second cut as bad as the first .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 5]: My blood was up .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 18]: ` If this is justice , then there _ is _ no God , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 4]: He stood aghast .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 4]: I went on .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 18]: ` If there be a God -- ' ' _ If _ there be a God ! '
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: he shrieked , and sprang towards me .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 8]: I did not move a step . '
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 22]: I hope there is , ' I said , as he seized me again ; ` for you are unjust . '
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 9]: I remember only a fierce succession of blows .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 29]: With Voltaire and the French revolution present to his mind in all their horror , he had been nourishing in his house a toad of the same spawn !
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 21]: He had been remiss , but would now compel those whom his neglect had injured to pay off his arrears !
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 5]: A most orthodox conclusion !
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 32]: but it did me little harm : it did not make me think that God was unjust , for my uncle , not Mr Forest , was my type of Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 17]: The harm it did was of another sort -- and to Charley , not to me .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 22]: Of course , while under the hands of the executioner , I could not observe what was going on around me .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 21]: When I began to awake from the absorption of my pain and indignation , I found myself in my room .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 11]: I had been ordered thither , and had mechanically obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 22]: I was on my bed , staring at the door , at which I had become aware of a gentle tapping .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 47]: ` Come in , ' I said ; and Charley -- who , although it was his room as much as mine , never entered when he thought I was there without knocking at the door -- appeared , with the face of a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 9]: Sore as I was , I jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 14]: ` The brute has not been thrashing _ you _ , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 15]: I cried , in a wrath that gave me the strength of a giant .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 25]: With that terrible bruise above his temple from Home 's fist , none but a devil could have dared to lay hands upon him !
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 16]: ` No , Wilfrid , ' he answered ; ` no such honour for me !
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 7]: I am disgraced for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 10]: He hid his wan face in his thin hands .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: ` What do you mean , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 10]: ` You can not have told a lie ! '
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 5]: ` No , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 7]: But it does n't matter now .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 10]: I do n't care for myself any more . '
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 13]: ` Then , Charley , what _ have _ you done ? '
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 10]: ` You are always so kind , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 11]: he returned , with a hopelessness which seemed almost coldness .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 23]: ` Charley , ' I said , ` if you do n't tell me what has happened -- ' ` Happened ! '
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 48]: ` Has n't that man been lashing at you like a dog , and I _ did n't _ rush at him , and if I could n't fight , being a milksop , then bite and kick and scratch , and take my share of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 4]: O God ! '
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 15]: he cried , in agony , ` if I had but a chance again !
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 12]: But nobody ever has more than one chance in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 15]: He may damn me now when he likes : I do n't care ! '
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 3]: Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 12]: I cried ; ` you 're as bad as Mr Forest .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 16]: Are you to say such things about God , when you know nothing of him ?
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 21]: He may be as good a God , after all , as even we should like him to be . '
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 9]: ` But Mr Forest is a clergyman . '
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 41]: ` And God was the God of Abraham before ever there was a clergyman to take his name in vain , ' I cried ; for I was half mad with the man who had thus wounded my Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 10]: _ I _ am content with you , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 8]: You are my best and only friend .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 8]: That is all nonsense about attacking Forest .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 9]: What could you have done , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 8]: Do n't talk such rubbish . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 22]: I might have taken my share with you , ' said Charley , and again buried his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 37]: ` Come , Charley , ' I said , and at the moment a fresh wave of manhood swept through my soul ; ` you and I will take our share together a hundred times yet .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 13]: I have done my part now ; yours will come next . '
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 13]: ` But to think of not sharing your disgrace , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 4]: ` Disgrace ! '
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 13]: I said , drawing myself up , ` where was that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: ` You 've been beaten , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 25]: ` Every stripe was a badge of honour , ' I said , ` for I neither deserved it nor cried out against it .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: I feel no disgrace . '
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 24]: ` Well , I 've missed the honour , ' said Charley ; ` but that 's nothing , so you have it .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 11]: But not to share your disgrace would have been mean .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 20]: And it 's all one ; for I thought it was disgrace , and I did not share it .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 10]: I am a coward for ever , Wilfrid . '
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 3]: ` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 7]: He never gave you a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 14]: _ I _ never thought of striking back : how should _ you ?
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 11]: _ ' ' I will be your slave , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 16]: You are _ so _ good , and I am _ so _ unworthy . '
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 17]: He put his arms round me , laid his head on my shoulder , and sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 16]: I did what more I could to comfort him , and gradually he grew calm .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 34]: At length he whispered in my ear -- ` After all , Wilfrid , I do believe I was horror-struck , and it _ was n't _ cowardice pure and simple . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 13]: I have n't a doubt of it , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 8]: I love you more than ever . '
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: ` Oh , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 12]: I should have gone mad by this time but for you .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 8]: Will you be my friend whatever happens ?
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 12]: -- Even if I should be a coward after all ? '
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 7]: ` Indeed I will , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 11]: -- What do you think Forest will do next ? '
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 39]: We resolved not to go down until we were sent for ; and then to be perfectly quiet , not speaking to any one unless we were spoken to ; and at dinner we carried out our resolution .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 16]: When bed-time came , we went as usual to make our bow to Mr Forest .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 19]: ` Cumbermede , ' he said sternly , ` you sleep in No. 5 until further orders . '
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 24]: ` Very well , sir , ' I said , and went , but lingered long enough to hear the fate of Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 16]: ` Home , ' said Mr Forest , ` you go to No. 3 . '
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 5]: That was our room .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 29]: ` Home , ' I said , having lingered on the stairs until he appeared , ` you do n't bear me a grudge , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 11]: ` It was my fault , ' said Home . '
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 9]: I had no right to pitch into you .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 8]: Only you 're such a cool beggar !
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 5]: But , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 11]: I did n't think Forest would have been so unfair .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 11]: If you forgive me , I 'll forgive you . '
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 19]: ` If I had n't stood up to you , I could n't , ' I returned . '
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 8]: I knew I had n't a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 10]: Besides , I had n't any breakfast . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 9]: I was a brute , ' said Home .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 15]: ` Oh , I do n't mind for myself ; but there 's Osborne !
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 10]: I wonder you could hit _ him _ . '
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 12]: ` He should n't have jawed me , ' said Home .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 7]: ` But you did first . '
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 25]: We had reached the door of the room which had been Home 's and was now to be mine , and went in together .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 7]: ` Did n't you now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 3]: I insisted .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 11]: ` Well , I did ; I confess I did .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 9]: And it was very plucky of him . '
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 11]: ` Tell him that , Home , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 9]: ` For God 's sake tell him that .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 5]: It will comfort him .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 9]: You must be kind to him , Home .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 13]: We 're not so bad as Forest takes us for . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 7]: I will , ' said Home .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 6]: And he kept his word .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 24]: We were never allowed to share the same room again , and school was not what it had been to either of us .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 24]: Within a few weeks Charley 's father , to our common dismay , suddenly appeared , and the next morning took him away .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 10]: What he said to Charley I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 23]: He did not take the least notice of me , and I believe would have prevented Charley from saying good-bye to me .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 66]: But just as they were going Charley left his father 's side , and came up to me with a flush on his face and a flash in his eye that made him look more manly and handsome than I had ever seen him , and shook hands with me , saying -- ` It 's all right -- is n't it , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 18]: ` It _ is _ all right , Charley , come what will , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 7]: ` Good-bye then , Wilfrid . '
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 6]: ` Good-bye , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 5]: And so we parted .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 13]: I do not care to say one word more about the school .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 10]: I continued there for another year and a half .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 21]: Partly in misery , partly in growing eagerness after knowledge , I gave myself to my studies with more diligence .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 31]: Mr Forest began to be pleased with me , and I have no doubt plumed himself on the vigorous measures by which he had nipped the bud of my infidelity .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 22]: For my part I drew no nearer to him , for I could not respect or trust him after his injustice .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 17]: I did my work for its own sake , uninfluenced by any desire to please him .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 14]: There was , in fact , no true relation between us any more .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 27]: I communicated nothing of what had happened to my uncle , because Mr Forest 's custom was to read every letter before it left the house .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 20]: But I longed for the day when I could tell the whole story to the great , simple-hearted man .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 4]: ONLY A LINK .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 30]: Before my return to England , I found that familiarity with the sights and sounds of a more magnificent nature had removed my past life to a great distance .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 21]: What had interested my childhood had strangely dwindled , yet gathered a new interest from its far-off and forsaken look .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 55]: So much did my past wear to me now the look of something read in a story , that I am haunted with a doubt whether I may not have communicated too much of this appearance to my description of it , although I have kept as true as my recollections would enable me .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 27]: The outlines must be correct : if the colouring be unreal , it is because of the haze which hangs about the memories of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 12]: The revisiting of old scenes is like walking into a mausoleum .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 10]: Everything is a monument of something dead and gone .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 5]: For we die daily .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 10]: Happy those who daily come to life as well !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 32]: I returned with a clear conscience , for not only had I as yet escaped corruption , but for the greater part of the time at least I had worked well .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 44]: If Mr Forest 's letter which I carried to my uncle contained any hint intended to my disadvantage , it certainly fell dead on his mind ; for he treated me with a consideration and respect which at once charmed and humbled me .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 27]: One day as we were walking together over the fields , I told him the whole story of the loss of the weapon at Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 48]: Up to the time of my leaving for Switzerland I had shrunk from any reference to the subject , so painful was it to me , and so convinced was I that his sympathy would be confined to a compassionate smile and a few words of condolence .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 27]: But glancing at his face now and then as I told the tale , I discovered more of interest in the play of his features than .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 24]: I had expected ; and when he learned that it was absolutely gone from me , his face flushed with what seemed anger .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 11]: For some moments after I had finished he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 17]: At length he said , ` It is a strange story , Wilfrid , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 11]: There must be some explanation of it , however . '
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 15]: He then questioned me about Mr Close , for suspicion pointed in his direction .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 54]: I was in great hopes he would follow my narrative with what he knew of the sword , but he was still silent , and I could not question him , for I had long suspected that its history had to do with the secret which he wanted me to keep from myself .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 25]: The very day of my arrival I went up to my grandmother 's room , which I found just as she had left it .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 14]: There stood her easy-chair , there her bed , there the old bureau .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 19]: The room looked far less mysterious now that she was not there ; but it looked painfully deserted .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 17]: One thing alone was still as it were enveloped in its ancient atmosphere -- the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 39]: I tried to open it -- with some trembling , I confess ; but only the drawers below were unlocked , and in them I found nothing but garments of old-fashioned stuffs , which I dared not touch .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 32]: But the day of childish romance was over , and life itself was too strong and fresh to allow me to brood on the past for more than an occasional half-hour .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 24]: My thoughts were full of Oxford , whither my uncle had resolved I should go ; and I worked hard in preparation . '
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 48]: I have not much money to spare , my boy , ' he said ; ` but I have insured my life for a sum sufficient to provide for your aunt , if she should survive me ; and after her death it will come to you .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 30]: Of course the old house and the park , which have been in the family for more years than I can tell , will be yours at my death .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 18]: A good part of the farm was once ours too , but not for these many years .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 56]: I could not recommend you to keep on the farm ; but I confess I should be sorry if you were to part with our own little place , although I do not doubt you might get a good sum for it from Sir Giles , to whose park it would be a desirable addition .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 65]: I believe at one time , the refusal to part with our poor little vineyard of Naboth was cause of great offence , even of open feud between the great family at the Hall and the yeomen who were your ancestors ; but poor men may be as unwilling as rich to break one strand of the cord that binds them to the past .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 22]: But of course when you come into the property , you will do as you see fit with your own . '
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 27]: ` You do n't think , uncle , I would sell this house , or the field it stands in , for all the Moldwarp estate ?
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 22]: I too have my share of pride in the family , although as yet I know nothing of its history . '
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 22]: ` Surely , Wilfrid , the feeling for one 's own people who have gone before is not necessarily pride ! '
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 14]: ` It does n't much matter what you call it , uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 9]: ` Yes , it does , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 14]: Either you call it by the right name or by the wrong name .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 21]: If your feeling _ is _ pride , then I am not objecting to the name , but the thing .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 17]: If your feeling is not pride , why call a good thing by a bad name ?
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 27]: But to return to our subject : my hope is that , if I give you a good education , you will make your own way .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 23]: You might , you know , let the park , as we call it , for a term of years . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 30]: I should n't mind letting the park , ' I answered , ` for a little while ; but nothing should ever make me let the dear old house .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 13]: What should I do if I wanted it to die in ? '
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 9]: The old man smiled , evidently not ill-pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 10]: ` What do you say to the bar ? '
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 4]: he asked . '
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 9]: I would rather not , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 8]: ` Would you prefer the Church ? '
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 9]: he asked , eyeing me a little doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 12]: ` No , certainly , uncle , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 22]: I should want to be surer of a good many things before I dared teach them to other people . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: I am glad of that , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 33]: The fear did cross my mind for a moment that you might be inclined to take to the Church as a profession , which seems to me the worst kind of infidelity .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 40]: A thousand times rather would I have you doubtful about what is to me the highest truth , than regarding it with the indifference of those who see in it only the prospect of a social position and livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 10]: Have you any plan of your own ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 34]: I have heard , ' I answered , circuitously , ` that many barristers have to support themselves by literary work , for years before their own profession begin to show them favour .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 12]: I should prefer going in for the writing at once . '
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 28]: ` It must be a hard struggle either way , ' he replied ; ` but I should not leave you without something to fall back upon .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: Tell me what makes you think you could be an author ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 35]: I am afraid it is presumptuous , ' I answered , ` but as often as I think of what I am to do , that is the first thing that occurs to me .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 32]: I suppose , ' I added , laughing , ` that the favour with which my school-fellows at Mr Elder 's used to receive my stories is to blame for it .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 11]: I used to tell them by the hour together . '
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 42]: ` Well , ' said my uncle , ` that proves , at least , that , if you had anything to say , you might be able to say it ; but I am afraid it proves nothing more . '
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 7]: ` Nothing more , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 12]: I only mentioned it to account for the notion . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 8]: I quite understand you , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 12]: Meantime , the best thing in any case will be Oxford .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 20]: I will do what I can to make it an easier life for you than I found it . '
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 40]: Having heard nothing of Charley Osborne since he left Mr Forest 's , I went one day , very soon after my return , to call on Mr Elder , partly in the hope of learning something about him .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 47]: I found Mrs Elder unchanged , but could not help fancying a difference in Mr Elder 's behaviour , which , after finding I could draw nothing from him concerning Charley , I attributed to Mr Osborne 's evil report , and returned foiled and vexed .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 39]: I told my uncle , with some circumstance , the whole story : explaining how , although unable to combat the doubts which occasioned Charley 's unhappiness , I had yet always hung to the side of believing .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 31]: ` You did right to do no more , my boy , ' said my uncle ; ` and it is clear you have been misunderstood -- and ill-used besides .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 11]: But every wrong will be set right some day . '
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 22]: My aunt showed me now far more consideration -- I do not say -- than she had _ felt _ before .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 26]: A curious kind of respect mingled with her kindness , which seemed a slighter form of the observance with which she constantly regarded my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 8]: My study was pretty hard and continuous .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 16]: I had no tutor to direct me or take any of the responsibility off me .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 12]: I walked to the Hall one morning to see Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 11]: She was kind , but more stiff even than before .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 9]: From her I learned two things of interest .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 24]: The first , which beyond measure delighted me , was , that Charley was at Oxford -- had been there for a year .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 11]: The second was that Clara was at school in London .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 23]: Mrs Wilson shut her mouth very primly after answering my question concerning her ; and I went no further in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 17]: I took no trouble to ask her concerning the relationship of which Mr Coningham had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 32]: I knew already from my uncle that it was a fact , but Mrs Wilson did not behave in such a manner as to render me inclined to broach the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 20]: If she wished it to remain a secret from me , she should be allowed to imagine it such .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 4]: CHARLEY AT OXFORD .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 38]: I have no time in this selection and combination of the parts of my story which are more especially my history , to dwell upon that portion of it which refers to my own life at Oxford .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 61]: I was so much of a student of books while there , and had so little to do with any of the men except Charley , that , save as it bore upon my intellect , Oxford had little special share in what life has made of me , and may in the press of other matter be left out .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 63]: Had I time , however , to set forth what I know of my own development more particularly , I could not pass over the influence of external Oxford , the architecture and general surroundings of which I recognized as affecting me more than anything I had yet met , with the exception of the Swiss mountains , pine-woods , and rivers .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 31]: It is , however , imperative to set forth the peculiar character of my relation to and intercourse with Charley , in order that what follows may be properly understood .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 26]: For no other reason than that my uncle had been there before me , I went to Corpus Christi , while Charley was at Exeter .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 20]: It was some days before we met , for I had twice failed in my attempts to find him .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 28]: At length , one afternoon , as I entered the quadrangle to make a third essay , there he was coming towards the gate with a companion .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 32]: When he caught sight of me , he advanced with a quick yet hesitating step -- a step with a question in it : he was not quite sure of me .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 19]: He was now approaching six feet in height , and of a graceful though not exactly dignified carriage .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 13]: His complexion remained as pale and his eyes as blue as before .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 19]: The pallor flushed and the blue sparkled as he made a few final and long strides towards me .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 21]: The grasp of the hand he gave me was powerful , but broken into sudden almost quivering relaxations and compressions .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 21]: I could not help fancying also that he was using some little effort to keep his eyes steady upon mine .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 49]: Altogether , I was not quite satisfied with our first meeting , and had a strong impression that , if our friendship was to be resumed , it was about to begin a new course , not building itself exactly on the old foundations , but starting afresh .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 14]: He looked almost on the way to become a man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 41]: Perhaps , however , the companionship he was in had something to do with this , for he was so nervously responsive , that he would unconsciously take on , for the moment , any appearance characterizing those about him .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 30]: His companion was a little taller and stouter-built than he ; with a bearing and gait of conscious importance , not so marked as to be at once offensive .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 66]: The upper part of his face was fine , the nose remarkably so , while the lower part was decidedly coarse , the chin too large , and the mouth having little form , except in the first movement of utterance , when an unpleasant curl took possession of the upper lip , which I afterwards interpreted as a doubt disguising itself in a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 16]: There was also in his manner a degree of self-assertion which favoured the same conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 24]: His hands were very large , a pair of merely blanched plebeian fists , with thumbs much turned back -- and altogether ungainly .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 16]: He wore very tight gloves , and never shook hands when he could help it .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 21]: His feet were scarcely so bad in form : still by no pretence could they be held to indicate breeding .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 21]: His manner , where he wished to conciliate , was pleasing ; but to me it was overbearing and unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 13]: He Was the only son of Sir Giles Brotherton of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 26]: Charley and he did not belong to the same college , but , unlike as they were , they had somehow taken to each other .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 36]: I presume it was the decision of his manner that attracted the wavering nature of Charley , who , with generally active impulses , was yet always in doubt when a moment requiring action arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 15]: Charley , having spoken to me , turned and introduced me to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 5]: Geoffrey Brotherton merely nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 13]: ` We were at school together in Switzerland , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' said Geoffrey , in a half-interrogatory , half-assenting tone .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 20]: 'Till I found your card in my box , I never heard of your coming , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: ` It was not my fault , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 18]: I did what I could to find out something about you , but all in vain . '
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 18]: ` Paternal precaution , I believe , ' he said , with something that approached a grimace .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 72]: Now , although I had little special reason to love Mr Osborne , and knew him to be a tyrant , I knew also that my old Charley could not have thus coolly uttered a disrespectful word of him , and I had therefore a painful though at the same time an undefined conviction that some degree of moral degeneracy must have taken place before he could express himself as now .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 56]: To many , such a remark will appear absurd , but I am confident that disrespect for the preceding generation , and especially for those in it nearest to ourselves , is a sure sign of relaxing dignity , and , in any extended manifestation , an equally sure symptom of national and political decadence .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 18]: My reader knows , however , that there was much to be said in excuse of Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 11]: His friend sauntered away , and we went on talking .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 15]: My heart longed to rest with his for a moment on the past . '
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 17]: I had a dreary time of it after you left , Charley , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 14]: ` Not so dreary as I had , Wilfrid , I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 10]: You had at least the mountains to comfort you .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 32]: Anywhere is better than at home , with a meal of Bible oil and vinegar twice a day for certain , and a wine-glassful of it now and then in between .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 8]: Damnation 's better than a spoony heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 12]: To be away from home is heaven enough for me . '
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 8]: ` But your mother , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 5]: I ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 7]: ` My mother is an angel .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 9]: I could almost be good for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 12]: But I never could , I never can get near her .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 39]: My father reads every letter she writes before it comes to me -- I know that by the style of it ; and I 'm equally certain he reads every letter of mine before it reaches her . '
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 8]: ` Is your sister at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 17]: She 's at school at Clapham -- being sand-papered into a saint , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 6]: His mouth twitched and quivered .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 12]: He was not pleased with himself for talking as he did .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 14]: ` Your father means it for the best , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 4]: I know that .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 7]: He means _ his _ best .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 22]: If I thought it _ was _ the best , I should cut my throat and have done with it . '
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 18]: ` But , Charley , could n't we do something to find out , after all ? '
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 8]: ` Find out what , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 15]: ` The best thing , you know ; what we are here for . '
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 10]: ` I 'm sick of it all , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 10]: I 've tried till I am sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 13]: If you should find out anything , you can let me know .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 8]: I am busy trying not to think .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 6]: I find that quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 12]: If I were to think , I should go mad . '
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 5]: ` Oh , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 39]: I ca n't bear to hear you talk like that , ' I exclaimed ; but there was a glitter in his eye which I did not like , and which made me anxious to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 10]: -- ` Do n't you like being here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 11]: I asked , in sore want of something to say .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 10]: ` Yes , well enough , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: ` But I do n't see what 's to come of it , for I ca n't work .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 17]: Even if my father were a millionnaire , I could n't go on living on him .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 10]: The sooner that is over , the better ! '
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 13]: He was looking down , and gnawing at that tremulous upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 5]: I felt miserable . '
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 12]: I wish we were at the same college , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 13]: ` It 's better as it is , ' he rejoined . '
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 7]: I should do you no good .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 10]: You go in for reading , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 6]: ` Well , I do .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 13]: I mean my uncle to have the worth of his money . '
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 9]: Charley looked no less miserable than I felt .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 24]: I saw that his conscience was speaking , and I knew he was the last in the world to succeed in excusing himself .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 39]: But I understood him better than he understood himself , and believed that his idleness arose from the old unrest , the weariness of that never satisfied questioning which the least attempt at thought was sure to awaken .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 21]: Once invaded by a question , Charley _ must _ answer it , or fail and fall into a stupor .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 15]: Not an ode of Horace could he read without finding himself plunged into metaphysics .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 23]: Enamoured of repose above all things , he was from every side stung to inquiry which seldom indeed afforded what seemed solution .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 43]: Hence , in part at least , it came that he had begun to study not merely how to avoid awakening the Sphinx , but by what opiates to keep her stretched supine with her lovely woman face betwixt her fierce lion-paws .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 40]: This also , no doubt , had a share in his becoming the associate of Geoffrey Brotherton , from whose company , if he had been at peace with himself , he would have recoiled upon the slightest acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 37]: I am at some loss to imagine what could have made Geoffrey take such a liking to Charley ; but I presume it was the confiding air characterizing all Charley 's behaviour that chiefly pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 30]: He seemed to look upon him with something of the tenderness a coarse man may show for a delicate Italian greyhound , fitted to be petted by a lady .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: That same evening Charley came to my rooms .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 31]: His manner was constrained , and yet suggested a whole tide of pent-up friendship which , but for some undeclared barrier , would have broken out and overflowed our intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 17]: After this one evening , however , it was some time before I saw him again .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 20]: When I called upon him next he was not at home , nor did he come to see me .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 10]: Again I sought him , but with like failure .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 26]: After a third attempt I desisted , not a little hurt , I confess , but not in the least inclined to quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 10]: I gave myself the more diligently to my work .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 9]: And now Oxford began to do me harm .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 26]: I saw so much idleness , and so much wrong of all kinds about me , that I began to consider myself a fine exception .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 54]: Because I did my poor duty -- no better than any honest lad must do it -- I became conceited ; and the manner in which Charley 's new friend treated me not only increased the fault , but aided in the development of certain other stems from the same root of self-partiality .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 18]: He never saluted me with other than what I regarded as a supercilious nod of the head .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 29]: When I met him in company with Charley , and the latter stopped to speak to me , he would walk on without the least change of step .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 21]: The indignation which this conduct aroused drove me to think as I had never thought before concerning my social position .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 7]: I found it impossible to define .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 49]: As I pondered , however , a certainty dawned upon me , rather than was arrived at by me , that there was some secret connected with my descent , upon which bore the history of the watch I carried , and of the sword I had lost .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 37]: On the mere possibility of something , utterly forgetful that , if the secret existed at all , it might be of a very different nature from my hopes , I began to build castles innumerable .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 79]: Perceiving , of course , that one of a decayed yeoman family could stand no social comparison with the heir to a rich baronetcy , I fell back upon absurd imaginings ; and what with the self-satisfaction of doing my duty , what with the vanity of my baby manhood , and what with the mystery I chose to believe in and interpret according to my desires , I was fast sliding into a moral condition contemptible indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 9]: But still my heart was true to Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 49]: When , after late hours of hard reading , I retired at last to my bed , and allowed my thoughts to wander where they would , seldom was there a night on which they did not turn as of themselves towards the memory of our past happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 27]: I vowed , although Charley had forsaken me , to keep his chamber in my heart ever empty , and closed against the entrance of another .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 16]: If ever he pleased to return , he should find he had been waited for .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 50]: I believe there was much of self-pity , and of self-approval as well , mingling with my regard for him ; but the constancy was there notwithstanding , and I regarded the love I thus cherished for Charley as the chief saving element in my condition at the time .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 42]: One night -- I can not now recall with certainty the time or season -- I only know it was night , and I was reading alone in my room -- a knock came to the door , and Charley entered .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 11]: I sprang from my seat and bounded to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 7]: ` At last , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 35]: But he almost pushed me aside , left me to shut the door he had opened , sat down in a chair by the fire , and began gnawing the head of his cane .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 22]: I resumed my seat , moved the lamp so that I could see him , and waited for him to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 17]: Then first I saw that his face was unnaturally pale and worn , almost even haggard .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 24]: His eyes were weary , and his whole manner as of one haunted by an evil presence of which he is ever aware .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 24]: ` You are an enviable fellow , Wilfrid , ' he said at length , with something between a groan and a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 10]: ` Why do you say that , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 7]: ` Why am I enviable ? '
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 6]: ` Because you can work .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 9]: I hate the very sight of a book .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 8]: I am afraid I shall be plucked .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 7]: I see nothing else for it .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 8]: And what will the old man say ?
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 11]: I have grace enough left to be sorry for him .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 13]: But he will take it out in sour looks and silences . '
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 7]: ` There 's time enough yet .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 19]: I wish you were not so far ahead of me : we might have worked together . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 9]: I ca n't work , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 4]: I hate it .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 18]: It will console my father , I hope , to find his prophecies concerning me come true .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 12]: I 've heard him abuse me to my mother . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 13]: I wish you would n't talk so of your father , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 6]: It 's not like you .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 9]: I ca n't bear to hear it . '
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 13]: ` It 's not like what I used to be , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 8]: But there 's none of that left .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 11]: What do you take me for -- honestly now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 29]: He hung his head low , his eyes fixed on the hearth-rug , not on the fire , and kept gnawing at the head of his cane . '
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 13]: I do n't like some of your companions , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 13]: ` To be sure I do n't know much of them . '
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 9]: ` The less you know , the better !
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 9]: If there be a devil , that fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 14]: Brotherton will hand me over to him -- bodily , before long . '
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you give him up ? '
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 9]: said I. ` It 's no use trying .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 9]: He 's got such a hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 22]: Never let a man you do n't know to the marrow pay even a toll-gate for you , Wilfrid . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 8]: I am in no danger , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 14]: Such people do n't take to me , ' I said , self-righteously .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 13]: ` But it ca n't be too late to break with him .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 18]: I know my uncle would -- I could manage a five-pound note now , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 11]: ` My dear boy , if I had borrowed -- .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 23]: But I have let him pay for me again and again , and I do n't know how to rid the obligation .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 6]: But it do n't signify .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 7]: It 's too late anyhow . '
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 8]: ` What have you done , Charley ?
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 8]: Nothing very wrong , I trust . '
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 5]: The lost look deepened .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 12]: ` It 's all over , Wilfrid , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 7]: ` But it do n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 11]: I can take to the river when I please . '
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 19]: ` But then you know you might happen to go right through the river , Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 21]: I know what you mean , ' he said , with a defiant sound like nothing I had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 4]: ` Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 12]: I cried , ' I ca n't bear to hear you .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 14]: You ca n't have changed so much already as not to trust me .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 10]: I will do all I can to help you .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 6]: What have you done ? '
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 6]: ` Oh , nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 14]: he rejoined , and tried to laugh : it was a dreadful failure .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 14]: ` But I ca n't bear to think of that mother of mine !
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 13]: I wish I could tell you all ; but I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 8]: How Brotherton would laugh at me now !
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: I ca n't be made quite like other people , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 12]: _ You _ would never have been such a fool . '
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 24]: ` You are more delicately made than most people , Charley -- `` touched to finer issues , '' as Shakspere says . '
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 8]: ` Who told you that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 8]: I think a great deal about you .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 9]: That is all you have left me . '
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 9]: ` I 've been a brute , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: But you 'll forgive me , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 19]: ` With all my heart , if you 'll only put it in my power to serve you .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 14]: Come , trust me , Charley , and tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 7]: I shall not betray you . '
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 19]: ` I 'm not afraid of that , ' he answered , and sunk into silence once more .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 11]: I look to myself presumptuous and priggish in the memory .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 8]: But I did mean truly by him .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 27]: I began to question him , and by slow degrees , in broken hints , and in jets of reply , drew from him the facts .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 28]: When at length he saw that I understood , he burst into tears , hid his face in his hands , and rocked himself to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 2]: Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 11]: do n't give in like that , ' I cried .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 20]: ` Be as sorry as you like ; but do n't go on as if there was no help .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 17]: Who has not failed and been forgiven -- in one way if not in another ? '
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 8]: ` Who is there to forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 5]: My father would not .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: And if he would , what difference would it make ?
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 9]: I have done it all the same . '
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 12]: ` But God , Charley -- ' I suggested , hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 5]: ` What of him ?
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 21]: If he should choose to pass a thing by and say nothing about it , that does n't undo it .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 5]: It 's all nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 17]: God himself ca n't make it that I did n't do what I did do . '
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 17]: But with what truthful yet reticent words can I convey the facts of Charley 's case ?
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 43]: I am perfectly aware it would be to expose both myself and him to the laughter of men of low development who behave as if no more _ self-possession _ were demanded of a man than of one of the lower animals .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 66]: Such might perhaps feel a certain involuntary movement of pitifulness at the fate of a woman first awaking to the consciousness that she can no more hold up her head amongst her kind : but that a youth should experience a similar sense of degradation and loss , they would regard as a degree of silliness and effeminacy below contempt , if not beyond belief .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 89]: But there is a sense of personal purity belonging to the man as well as to the woman ; and although I dare not say that in the most refined of masculine natures it asserts itself with the awful majesty with which it makes its presence known in the heart of a woman , the man in whom it speaks with most authority is to be found amongst the worthiest ; and to a youth like Charley the result of actual offence against it might be utter ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 39]: In his case , however , it was not merely a consciousness of personal defilement which followed ; for , whether his companions had so schemed it or not , he supposed himself more than ordinarily guilty . '
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 16]: I suppose I must marry the girl , ' said poor Charley with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 30]: Happily I saw at once that there might be two sides to the question , and that it was desirable to know more ere I ventured a definite reply .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 41]: I had grown up , thanks to many things , with a most real although vague adoration of women ; but I was not so ignorant as to be unable to fancy it possible that Charley had been the victim .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 28]: Therefore , after having managed to comfort him a little , and taken him home to his rooms , I set about endeavouring to get further information .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 22]: I will not linger over the affair -- as unpleasant to myself as it can be to any of my readers .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 35]: It had to be mentioned , however , not merely as explaining how I got hold of Charley again , but as affording a clue to his character , and so to his history .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 19]: Not even yet can I think without a gush of anger and shame of my visit to Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 60]: With what stammering confusion I succeeded at last in making him understand the nature of the information I wanted , I will not attempt to describe ; nor the roar of laughter which at length burst bellowing -- not from himself only , but from three or four companions as well to whom he turned and communicated the joke .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 31]: The fire of jests , and proposals , and interpretations of motive which I had then to endure , seems yet to scorch my very brain at the mere recollection .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 32]: From their manner and speech , I was almost convinced that they had laid a trap for Charley , whom they regarded as a simpleton , to enjoy his consequent confusion .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 49]: With what I managed to find out elsewhere , I was at length satisfied , and happily succeeded in convincing Charley , that he had been the butt of his companions , and that he was far the more injured person in any possible aspect of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 27]: I shall never forget the look or the sigh of relief which proved that at last his mind had opened to the facts of the case .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 13]: ` Wilfrid , ' he said , ` you have saved me .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 7]: We shall never be parted more .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 11]: See if I am ever false to you again ! '
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 10]: And yet it never was as it had been .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 7]: I am sure of that now .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 11]: Henceforth , however , he entirely avoided his former companions .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 6]: Our old friendship was renewed .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 41]: Our old talks arose again , And now that he was not alone in them , the perplexities under which he had broken down when left to encounter them by himself were not so overwhelming as to render him helpless .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 30]: We read a good deal together , and Charley helped me much in the finer affairs of the classics , for his perceptions were as delicate as his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 38]: He would brood over an Horatian phrase as Keats would brood over a sweet pea or a violet ; the very tone in which he would repeat it would waft me from it an aroma unperceived before .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 25]: When it was his turn to come to my rooms , I would watch for his arrival almost as a lover for his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 18]: For two years more our friendship grew ; in which time Charley had recovered habits of diligence .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 22]: I presume he said nothing at home of the renewal of his intimacy with me : I shrunk from questioning him .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 46]: As if he had been an angel who who had hurt his wing and was compelled to sojourn with me for a time , I feared to bring the least shadow over his face , and indeed fell into a restless observance of his moods .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 9]: I remember we read _ Comus _ together .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 12]: How his face would glow at the impassioned praises of virtue !
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 18]: and how the glow would die into a grey sadness at the recollection of the near past !
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 9]: I could read his face like a book .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 34]: At length the time arrived when we had to part , he to study for the Bar , I to remain at Oxford another year , still looking forward to a literary life .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 40]: When I commenced writing my story , I fancied myself so far removed from it that I could regard it as the story of another , capable of being viewed on all sides , and conjectured and speculated upon .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 17]: And so I found it as long as the regions of childhood and youth detained me .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 35]: But as I approach the middle scenes , I begin to fear the revival of the old torture ; that , from the dispassionate reviewer , I may become once again the suffering actor .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 61]: Long ago I read a strange story of a man condemned at periods unforeseen to act again , and yet again , in absolute verisimilitude each of the scenes of his former life : I have a feeling as if I too might glide from the present into the past without a sign to warn me of the coming transition .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 27]: One word more ere I pass to the middle events , those for the sake of which the beginning is and the end shall be recorded .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 26]: It is this -- that I am under endless obligations to Charley for opening my eyes at this time to my overweening estimate of myself .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 14]: Not that he spoke -- Charley could never have reproved even a child .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 13]: But I could tell almost any sudden feeling that passed through him .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 5]: His face betrayed it .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 10]: What he felt about me I saw at once .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 71]: From the signs of his mind , I often recognized the character of what was in my own ; and thus seeing myself through him , I gathered reason to be ashamed ; while the refinement of his criticism , the quickness of his perception , and the novelty and force of his remarks , convinced me that I could not for a moment compare with him in mental gifts .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 36]: The upper hand of influence I had over him I attribute to the greater freedom of my training , and the enlarged ideas which had led my uncle to avoid enthralling me to his notions .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 40]: He believed the truth could afford to wait until I was capable of seeing it for myself ; and that the best embodiments of truth are but bonds and fetters to him who can not accept them as such .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 28]: When I could not agree with him , he would say with one of his fine smiles , ` We 'll drop it , then , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: I do n't believe you have caught my meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 19]: If I am right , you will see it some day , and there 's no hurry . '
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 19]: How could it be but Charlie and I should be different , seeing we had fared so differently !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 12]: my knowledge of his character is chiefly the result of after-thought .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 54]: I do not mean this manuscript to be read until after my death ; and even then -- although partly from habit , partly that I dare not trust myself to any other form of utterance , I write as if for publication -- even then , I say , only by one .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 37]: I am about to write what I should not die in peace if I thought she would never know ; but which I dare not seek to tell her now for the risk of being misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 38]: I thank God for that blessed invention , Death , which of itself must set many things right , and gives a man a chance of justifying himself where he would not have been heard while alive .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 46]: Lest my manuscript should fall into other hands , I have taken care that not a single name in it should contain even a side-look or hint at the true one ; but she will be able to understand the real person in every case .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 4]: MY WHITE MARE .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 13]: I passed my final examinations with credit , if not with honour .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 12]: It was not yet clearly determined what I should do next .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 14]: My goal was London , but I was unwilling to go thither empty-handed .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 31]: I had been thinking as well as reading a good deal ; a late experience had stimulated my imagination ; and at spare moments I had been writing a tale .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 23]: It had grown to be a considerable mass of manuscript , and I was anxious , before going , to finish it .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 25]: Hence , therefore , I returned home with the intention of remaining there quietly for a few months before setting-out to seek my fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 43]: Whether my uncle in his heart quite favoured the plan , I have my doubts , but it would have been quite inconsistent with his usual grand treatment of me to oppose anything not wrong on which I had set my heart .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 44]: Finding now that I took less exercise than he thought desirable , and kept myself too much to my room , he gave me a fresh proof of his unvarying kindness , He bought me a small grey mare of strength and speed .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 25]: Her lineage was unknown ; but her small head , broad fine chest , and clean limbs indicated Arab blood at no great remove .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 20]: Upon her I used to gallop over the fields , or saunter along the lanes , dreaming and inventing .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 38]: And now certain feelings , too deeply rooted in my nature for my memory to recognize their beginnings , began to assume colour and condensed form , as if about to burst into some kind of blossom .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 24]: Thanks to my education and love of study , also to a self-respect undefined yet restraining , nothing had occurred to wrong them .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 12]: In my heart of hearts I worshipped the idea of womanhood .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 18]: I thank Heaven , if ever I do thank for anything , that I still worship thus .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 48]: how many have put on the acolyte 's robe in the same temple , who have ere long cast dirt upon the statue of their divinity , _ then _ dragged her as defiled from her lofty pedestal , and left her lying dishonoured at its foot !
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 45]: Instead of feeding with holy oil the lamp of the higher instinct , which would glorify and purify the lower , they feed the fire of the lower with vile fuel , which sends up its stinging smoke to becloud and blot the higher .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 61]: One lovely Spring morning , the buds half out , and the wind blowing fresh and strong , the white clouds scudding across a blue gulf of sky , and the tall trees far away swinging as of old , when they churned the wind for my childish fancy , I looked up from my book and saw it all .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 26]: The gladness of nature entered into me , and my heart swelled so in my bosom that I turned with distaste from all further labour .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 13]: I pushed my papers from me , and went to the window .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 18]: The short grass all about was leaning away from the wind , shivering and showing its enamel .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 15]: Still , as in childhood , the wind had a special power over me .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 18]: In another moment I was out of the house and hastening to the farm for my mare .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 9]: She neighed at the sound of my step .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 23]: I saddled and bridled her , sprung on her back , and galloped across the grass in the direction of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 52]: In a few moments I was within the lodge gates , walking my mare along the gravelled drive , and with the reins on the white curved neck before me , looking up at those lofty pines , whose lonely heads were swinging in the air like floating but fettered islands .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 57]: My head had begun to feel dizzy with the ever-iterated , slow , half-circular sweep , when , just opposite the lawn stretching from a low wire fence up to the door of the steward 's house , my mare shied , darted to the other side of the road , and flew across the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 12]: Caught thus lounging on my saddle , I was almost unseated .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 31]: As soon as I had pulled her up , I turned to see what had startled her , for the impression of a white flash remained upon my mental sensorium .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 35]: There , leaning on the little gate , looking much diverted , stood the loveliest creature , in a morning dress of white , which the wind was blowing about her like a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 32]: She had no hat on , and her hair , as if eager to join in the merriment of the day , was flying like the ribbons of a tattered sail .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 4]: A humanized Dryad !
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 34]: -- one that had been caught young , but in whom the forest-sap still asserted itself in wild affinities with the wind and the swaying branches , and the white clouds careering across !
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 5]: Could it be Clara ?
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 9]: How could it be any other than Clara ?
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 4]: I rode back .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 28]: I was a little short-sighted , and had to get pretty near before I could be certain ; but she knew me , and waited my approach .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 17]: When I came near enough to see them , I could not mistake those violet eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 15]: I was now in my twentieth year , and had never been in love .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 15]: Whether I now fell in love or not , I leave to my reader .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 12]: Clara was even more beautiful than her girlish loveliness had promised .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 66]: ` An exceeding fair forehead , ' to quote Sir Philip Sidney ; eyes of which I have said enough ; a nose more delicate than symmetrical ; a mouth rather thin-lipped , but well curved ; a chin rather small , I confess ; -- but did any one ever from the most elaborated description acquire even an approximate idea of the face intended ?
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 32]: Her person was lithe and graceful ; she had good hands and feet ; and the fairness of her skin gave her brown hair a duskier look than belonged to itself .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 31]: Before I was yet near enough to be certain of her , I lifted my hat , and she returned the salutation with an almost familiar nod and smile . '
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 29]: I am very sorry , ' she said , speaking first -- in her old half-mocking way , ` that I so nearly cost you your seat . '
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 11]: ` It was my own carelessness , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 24]: ` Surely I am right in taking you for the lady who allowed me , in old times , to call her Clara ?
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 14]: How I could ever have had the presumption I can not imagine . '
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 32]: ` Of course that is a familiarity not to be thought of between full-grown people like us , Mr Cumbermede , ' she rejoined , and her smile became a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 11]: ` Ah , you do recognize me , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 16]: I said , thinking her cool , but forgetting the thought the next moment . '
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 5]: I guess at you .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 21]: If you had been dressed as on one occasion , I should not have got so far as that . '
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 28]: Pleased at this merry reference to our meeting on the Wengern Alp , I was yet embarrassed to find that nothing more suggested itself to be said .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 32]: But while I was quieting my mare , which happily afforded me some pretext at the moment , another voice fell on my ear -- hoarse , but breezy and pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 27]: ` So , Clara , you are no sooner back to old quarters than you give a rendezvous at the garden-gate -- eh , girl ? '
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 39]: ` Rather an ill-chosen spot for the purpose , papa , ' she returned , laughing , ` especially as the gentleman has too much to do with his horse to get off and talk to me . '
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 9]: our old friend Mr Cumbermede , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 7]: Only rather more of him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 26]: he added , laughing , as he opened the little gate in the wire fence , and coming up to me , shook hands heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 9]: ` Delighted to see you , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 8]: Have you left Oxford for good ? '
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 13]: ` Yes , ' I answered -- ` some time ago . '
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 15]: ` And may I ask what you 're turning your attention to now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 26]: ` Well , I hardly like to confess it , but I mean to have a try at -- something in the literary way . '
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 4]: ` Plucky enough !
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 23]: The paths of literature are not certainly the paths of pleasantness or of peace even -- so far as ever I heard .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 12]: Somebody said you were going in for the law . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 9]: I thought there were too many lawyers already .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 40]: One so often hears of barristers with nothing to do , and glad to take to the pen , that I thought it might be better to begin with what I should most probably come to at last . '
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 20]: but , Mr Cumbermede , there are other departments of the law which bring quicker returns than the bar .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 27]: If you would put yourself in my hands now , you should be earning your bread at least within a couple of years or so . '
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 40]: ` You are very kind , ' I returned , heartily , for he spoke as if he meant what he said ; ` but you see I have a leaning to the one and not to the other .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 14]: I should like to have a try first , at all events . '
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 14]: ` Well , perhaps it 's better to begin by following your bent .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 12]: You may find the road take a turn , though . '
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 3]: ` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 11]: I will go on till it does , though . '
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 27]: While we talked , Clara had followed her father , and was now patting my mare 's neck with a nice , plump , fair-fingered hand .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 15]: The creature stood with her arched neck and small head turned lovingly towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 13]: ` What a nice white thing you have got to ride ! '
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 4]: she said . '
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 8]: I hope it is your own . '
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 8]: ` Why do you hope that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 16]: ` Because it 's best to ride your own horse , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 7]: she answered , looking up naïvely .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 10]: ` Would _ you _ like to ride her ?
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 18]: I believe she has carried a lady , though not since she came into my possession . '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 18]: Instead of answering me , she looked round at her father , who stood by smiling benignantly .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 12]: Her look said -- ` If papa would let me . '
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 9]: He did not reply , but seemed waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 3]: I resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 12]: ` Are you a good horsewoman , Miss -- Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 14]: I said , with a feel after the recovery of old privileges . '
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 36]: I must not sing my own praises , Mr -- Wilfrid , ' she rejoined , ` but I _ have _ ridden in Rotten Row , and I believe without any signal disgrace . '
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 8]: ` Have you got a side-saddle ? '
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 5]: I asked , dismounting .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 5]: Mr Coningham spoke now .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 18]: ` Do n't you think Mr Cumbermede 's horse a little too frisky for you , Clara ?
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 17]: I know so little about you , I ca n't tell what you 're fit for .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 19]: -- She used to ride pretty well as a girl , ' he added , turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 12]: ` I 've not forgotten that , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 11]: I shall walk by her side , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 5]: ` Shall you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 8]: she said , with a sly look .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 29]: ` Perhaps , ' I suggested , ` your grandfather would let me have his horse , and then we might have a gallop across the park . '
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 30]: ` The best way , ' said Mr Coningham , ` will be to let the gardener take your horse , while you come in and have some luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 9]: We 'll see about the mount after that .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 20]: My horse has to carry me back in the evening , else I should be happy to join you .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 11]: She 's a fine creature , that of yours . '
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 8]: ` She 's the handiest creature ! '
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 18]: I said -- ' a little skittish , but very affectionate , and has a fine mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 16]: Perhaps she ought to have a curb-bit for you , though , Miss Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 33]: ` We 'll manage with a snaffle , ' she answered , with , I thought , another sly glance at me , out of eyes sparkling with suppressed merriment and expectation !
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 24]: Her father had gone to find the gardener , and as we stood waiting for him she still stroked the mare 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 20]: ` Are you not afraid of taking cold , ' I said , ` without your bonnet ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 13]: I never had a cold in my life , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 6]: ` That is saying much .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 18]: You would have me believe you are not made of the same clay as other people . '
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 11]: ` Believe anything you like , ' she answered carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 11]: ` Then I do believe it , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 36]: She looked me in the face , took her hand from the mare 's neck , stepped back half-a-foot and looked round , saying -- ' I wonder where that man can have got to .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 12]: Oh , here he comes , and papa with him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 68]: We went across the trim little lawn , which lay waiting for the warmer weather to burst into a profusion of roses , and through a trellised porch entered a shadowy little hall , with heads of stags and foxes , an old-fashioned glass-doored bookcase , and hunting and riding whips , whence we passed into a low-pitched drawing-room , redolent of dried rose-leaves and fresh hyacinths .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 32]: A little pug-dog , which seemed to have failed in swallowing some big dog 's tongue , jumped up barking from the sheep-skin mat , where he lay before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 5]: ` Stupid pug ! '
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 8]: ` You never know friends from foes !
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 8]: I wonder where my aunt is . '
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 5]: She left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: Her father had not followed us .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 36]: I sat down on the sofa , and began turning over a pretty book bound in red silk , one of the first of the _ annual _ tribe , which lay on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 43]: I was deep in one of its eastern stories when , hearing a slight movement , I looked up , and there sat Clara in a low chair by the window , working at a delicate bit of lace with a needle .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 14]: She looked somehow as if she had been there an hour at least .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 9]: I laid down the book with some exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 10]: ` What is the matter , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 18]: she asked , with the slightest possible glance up from the fine meshes of her work . '
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 13]: I had not the slightest idea you were in the room . '
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 5]: ` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 29]: How could a literary man , with a _ Forget-me-not _ in his hand , be expected to know that a girl had come into the room ? '
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 11]: ` Have you been at school all this time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 11]: I asked , for the sake of avoiding a silence .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 6]: ` All what time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 10]: ` Say , since we parted in Switzerland . '
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 4]: ` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 12]: I have been staying with an aunt for nearly a year .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 10]: Have you been at college all this time ? '
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 6]: ` At school and college .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 7]: When did you come home ? '
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 14]: ` This is not my home , but I came here yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 13]: ` Do n't you find the country dull after London ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 8]: I have n't had time yet . '
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 11]: ` Did they give you riding lessons at school ? '
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 12]: But my aunt took care of my morals in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 15]: A girl might as well not be able to dance as ride now-a-days . '
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 9]: ` Who rode with you in the park ?
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 5]: Not the riding-master ? '
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 22]: With a slight flush on her face she retorted , ` How many more questions are you going to ask me ?
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 21]: I should like to know , that I may make up my mind how many of them to answer . '
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 7]: ` Suppose we say six . '
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 8]: ` Very well , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 14]: ` Now I shall answer your last question and count that the first .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 15]: About nine o'clock , one -- day -- ' ` Morning or evening ? '
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 21]: ` Morning of course -- I walked out of -- the house -- ' ` Your aunt 's house ? '
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 11]: ` Yes , of course , my aunt 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 9]: Do let me go on with my story .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 18]: It was getting a little dark -- ' ` Getting dark at nine in the morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 10]: ` In the evening , I said . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 13]: I beg your pardon , I thought you said the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 40]: ` No , no , the evening ; and of course I was a little frightened , for I was not accustomed -- ' ` But you were never out alone at that hour , -- in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 8]: ` Yes , I was quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 23]: I had promised to meet -- a friend at the corner of -- You know that part , do you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 4]: What part ? '
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 5]: ` Oh -- Mayfair .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 9]: You know Mayfair , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 18]: ` You were going to meet a gentleman at the corner of Mayfair -- were you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 7]: I said , getting quite bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 25]: She jumped up , clapping her hands as gracefully as merrily , and crying -- ' I was n't going to meet any gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 6]: Your six questions are answered .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 25]: I wo n't answer a single other you choose to ask , unless I please , which is not in the least likely . '
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 16]: She made me a low half merry , half mocking courtesy and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 39]: The same moment her father came in , following old Mr Coningham , who gave me a kindly welcome , and said his horse was at my service , but he hoped I would lunch with him first .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 10]: I gratefully consented , and soon luncheon was announced .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 14]: Miss Coningham , Clara 's aunt , was in the dining-room before us .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 13]: A dry , antiquated woman , she greeted me with unexpected frankness .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 26]: Lunch was half over before Clara entered -- in a perfectly fitting habit , her hat on , and her skirt thrown over her arm .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 6]: ` Soho , Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 25]: cried her father ; ` you want to take us by surprise -- coming out all at once a town-bred lady , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 14]: ` Why , where ever did you get that riding-habit , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 4]: said her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 11]: ` In my box , aunt , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 16]: ` My word , child , but your father has kept you in pocket-money ! '
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 4]: returned Miss Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 39]: ` I 've got a town aunt as well as a country one , ' rejoined Clara , with an expression I could not quite understand , but out of which her laugh took only half the sting .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 6]: Miss Coningham reddened a little .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 23]: I judged afterwards that Clara had been diplomatically allowing her just to feel what sharp claws she had for use if required .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 24]: But the effect of the change from loose white muslin to tight dark cloth was marvellous , and I was bewitched by it .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 19]: So slight , yet so round , so trim , yet so pliant -- she was grace itself .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 30]: It seemed as if the former object of my admiration had vanished , and I had found another with such surpassing charms that the loss could not be regretted .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 30]: I may just mention that the change appeared also to bring out a certain look of determination which I now recalled as having belonged to her when a child .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 4]: ` Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 22]: said her father , in a very marked tone ; whereupon it was Clara 's turn to blush and be silent .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 14]: I started some new subject , in the airiest manner I could command .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 19]: Clara recovered her composure , and I flattered myself she looked a little grateful when our eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 35]: But I caught her father 's eyes twinkling now and then as if from some secret source of merriment , and could not help fancying he was more amused than displeased with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 4]: A RIDING LESSON .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 24]: By the time luncheon was over , the horses had been standing some minutes at the lawn-gate , my mare with a side-saddle .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 13]: We hastened to mount , Clara 's eyes full of expectant frolic .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 24]: I managed , as I thought , to get before her father , and had the pleasure of lifting her to the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 13]: She was up ere I could feel her weight on my arm .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 26]: When I gathered her again with my eyes , she was seated as calmly as if at her lace-needlework , only her eyes were sparkling .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 23]: With the slightest help , she had her foot in the stirrup , and with a single movement had her skirt comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 54]: I left her , to mount the horse they had brought me , and when I looked from his back , the white mare was already flashing across the boles of the trees , and Clara 's dark skirt flying out behind like the drapery of a descending goddess in an allegorical picture .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 42]: With a pang of terror I fancied the mare had run away with her , and sat for a moment afraid to follow , lest the sound of my horse 's feet on the turf should make her gallop the faster .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 21]: But the next moment she turned in her saddle , and I saw a face alive with pleasure and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 22]: As she recovered her seat , she waved her hand to me , and I put my horse to his speed .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 17]: I had not gone far , however , before I perceived a fresh cause of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 9]: She was making straight for a wire fence .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 31]: I had heard that horses could not see such a fence , and if Clara did not see it , or should be careless , the result would be frightful .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 11]: I shouted after her , but she took no heed .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 33]: Fortunately , however , there was right in front of them a gate , which I had not at first observed , into the bars of which had been wattled some brushwood .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 13]: ` The mare will see that , ' I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 20]: But the words were hardly through my mind , before I saw them fly over it like a bird .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 14]: On the other side , she pulled up , and waited for me .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 11]: Now I had never jumped a fence in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 22]: I did not know that my mare could do such a thing , for I had never given her the chance .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 17]: I was not , and never have become , what would be considered an accomplished horseman .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 8]: I scarcely know a word of stable-slang .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 19]: I have never followed the hounds more than twice or three times in the course of my life .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 24]: Not the less am I a true lover of horses -- but I have been their companion more in work than in play .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 21]: I have slept for miles on horseback , but even now I have not a sure seat over a fence .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 26]: I knew nothing of the animal I rode , but I was bound , at least , to make the attempt to follow my leader .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 47]: I was too inexperienced not to put him to his speed instead of going gently up to the gate ; and I had a bad habit of leaning forward in my saddle , besides knowing nothing of how to incline myself backwards as the horse alighted .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 25]: Hence when I found myself on the other side , it was not on my horse 's back , but on my own face .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 9]: I rose uninjured , except in my self-esteem .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 21]: I fear I was for the moment as much disconcerted as if I had been guilty of some moral fault .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 18]: Nor did it help me much towards regaining my composure that Clara was shaking with suppressed laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 27]: Utterly stupid from mortification , I laid hold of my horse , which stood waiting for me beside the mare , and scrambled upon his back .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 25]: But Clara , who , with all her fun , was far from being ill-natured , fancied from my silence that I was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 4]: Her merriment vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 26]: With quite an anxious expression on her face , she drew to my side , saying -- ' I hope you are not hurt ? '
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 9]: ` Only my pride , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 10]: ` Never mind that , ' she returned gaily .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 9]: ` That will soon be itself again . '
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 11]: ` I 'm not so sure , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 14]: ` To make such a fool of myself before _ you _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 9]: ` Am I such a formidable person ? '
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 13]: ` But I never jumped a fence in my life before . '
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 23]: ` If you had been afraid , ' she said , ` and had pulled up , I might have despised you .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 10]: As it was , I only laughed at you .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 5]: Where was the harm ?
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 4]: You shirked nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 5]: You followed your leader .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 17]: Come along , I will give you a lesson or two before we get back . '
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 25]: ` Thank you , ' I said , beginning to recover my spirits a little ; ' I shall be a most obedient pupil .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 11]: But how did you get so clever , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 16]: I ventured the unprotected name , and she took no notice of the liberty . '
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 9]: I told you I had had a riding-master .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 22]: If you are not afraid , and mind what you are told , you will always come right somehow . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 13]: I suspect that is good advice for more than horsemanship . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 9]: I had not the slightest intention of moralizing .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 18]: I am incapable of it , ' she answered , in a tone of serious self-defence . '
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 14]: I had as little intention of making the accusation , ' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 11]: ` But will you really teach me a little ? '
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 4]: ` Most willingly .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 8]: To begin , you must sit erect .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 5]: You lean forward . '
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 5]: Is this better ? '
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 5]: ` Yes , better .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 5]: A little more yet .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 8]: You ought to have your stirrups shorter .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 11]: It is a poor affectation to ride like a trooper .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 6]: Their own officers do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 20]: You can tell any novice by his long leathers , his heels down and his toes in his stirrups .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 11]: Ride home , if you want to ride comfortably . '
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 36]: The phrase was new to me , but I guessed what she meant ; and without dismounting , pulled my stirrup-leathers a couple of holes shorter , and thrust my feet through to the instep .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 6]: She watched the whole proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 11]: you look more like riding now , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 7]: ` Let us have another canter .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 16]: I will promise not to lead you over any more fences without due warning . '
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 13]: ` And due admonition as well , I trust , Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 8]: She nodded , and away we went .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: I had never been so proud of my mare .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 21]: She showed to much advantage , with the graceful figure on her back , which she carried like a feather .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 24]: ` Now there 's a little fence , ' she said , pointing where a rail or two protected a clump of plantation .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 16]: ` You must mind the young wood though , or we shall get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 15]: Mind you throw yourself back a little -- as you see me do . '
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 24]: I watched her , and following her directions , did better this time , for I got over somehow and recovered my seat .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 7]: You improve , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 24]: ` Now we 're pounded , unless you can jump again , and it is not quite so easy from this side . '
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 13]: When we alighted , I found my saddle in the proper place .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 4]: ` Bravo ! '
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 4]: she cried . '
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 7]: I entirely forgive your first misadventure .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 6]: You do splendidly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 15]: I would rather you forgot it , Clara , ' I cried , ungallantly .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 12]: ` Well , I will be generous , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 13]: ` Besides , I owe you something for such a charming ride .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 8]: I _ will _ forget it . '
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 21]: ` Thank you , ' I said , and drawing closer would have laid my left hand on her right .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 25]: Whether she foresaw my intention , I do not know ; but in a moment she was yards away , scampering over the grass .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 8]: My horse could never have overtaken hers .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 26]: By the time she drew rein and allowed me to get alongside of her once more , we were in sight : of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 17]: It stood with one corner towards us , giving the perspective of two sides at once .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 13]: She stopped her mare , and said , ` There , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 13]: What would you give to call a place like that your own ?
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 14]: What a thing to have a house like that to live in ! '
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 17]: -LSB- Illustration : `` NOW THERE 'S A LITTLE FENCE , '' SHE SAID . -RSB- '
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 12]: I know something I should like better , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 22]: I assure my reader I was not so silly as to be on the point of making her an offer already .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 7]: Neither did she so misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 17]: She was very near the mark of my meaning when she rejoined -- ` Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 18]: I suppose you would prefer being called a fine poet , or something of the sort . '
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 24]: I was glad she did not give me time to reply , for I had not intended to expose myself to her ridicule .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 41]: She was off again at a gallop towards the Hall , straight for the less accessible of the two gates , and had scrambled the mare up to the very bell-pull and rung it before I could get near her .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 20]: When the porter appeared in the wicket -- ` Open the gate , Jansen , ' she said . '
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 17]: I want to see Mrs Wilson , and I do n't want to get down . '
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 16]: ` But horses never come in here , Miss , ' said the man . '
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 16]: I mean to make an exception in favour of this mare , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 34]: The man hesitated a moment , then retreated -- but only to obey , as we understood at once by the creaking of the dry hinges , which were seldom required to move .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 14]: ` You wo n't mind holding her for me , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 7]: she said , turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 23]: I had been sitting mute with surprise both at the way in which she ordered the man , and at his obedience .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 7]: But now I found my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 39]: ` Do n't you think , Miss Coningham , ' I said -- for the man was within hearing , ` we had better leave them both with the porter , and then we could go in together ?
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 22]: I 'm not sure that those flags , not to mention the steps , are good footing for that mare . '
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 11]: you 're afraid of your animal , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 3]: she rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 5]: ` Very well . '
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 10]: ` Shall I hold your stirrup for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 17]: Before I could dismount , she had slipped off , and begun gathering up her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: The man came and took the horses .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 8]: We entered by the open gate together .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 11]: ` How can you be so cruel , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 9]: ` You _ will _ always misinterpret me !
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 8]: I was quite right about the flags .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 18]: Do n't you see how hard they are , and how slippery therefore for iron shoes ? '
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 31]: ` You might have seen by this time that I know quite as much about horses as you do , ' she returned , a little cross , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 28]: ` You can ride ever so much better , ' I answered ; ` but it does not follow you know more about horses than I do .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 15]: I once saw a horse have a frightful fall on just such a pavement .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 21]: Besides , does one think _ only _ of the horse when there 's an angel on his back ? '
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 10]: It was a silly speech , and deserved rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 18]: ` I 'm not in the least fond of _ such _ compliments , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 14]: By this time we had reached the door of Mrs Wilson 's apartment .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 10]: She received us rather stiffly , even for her .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 56]: After some commonplace talk , in which , without departing from facts , Clara made it appear that she had set out for the express purpose of paying Mrs Wilson a visit , I asked if the family was at home , and finding they were not , begged leave to walk into the library .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 19]: ` We 'll go together , ' she said , apparently not caring about a tête-à-tête with Clara .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 11]: Evidently the old lady liked her as little as ever .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 31]: We left the house , and entering again by a side door , passed on our way through the little gallery , into which I had dropped from the roof .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 16]: ` Look , Clara , that is where I came down , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 4]: She merely nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 19]: But Mrs Wilson looked very sharply , first at the one , then at the other of us .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 40]: When we reached the library , I found it in the same miserable condition as before , and could not help exclaiming with some indignation , ` It _ is _ a shame to see such treasures mouldering there !
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 17]: I am confident there are many valuable books among them , getting ruined from pure neglect .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 7]: I wish I knew Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 14]: I would ask him to let me come and set them right . '
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 19]: ` You would be choked with dust and cobwebs in an hour 's time , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 15]: ` Besides , I do n't think Mrs Wilson would like the proceeding . '
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 13]: ` What do you ground that remark upon , Miss Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 9]: said the housekeeper in a dry tone . '
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 23]: I thought you used them for firewood occasionally , ' answered Clara , with an innocent expression both of manner and voice .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 40]: The most prudent answer to such an absurd charge would have been a laugh ; but Mrs Wilson vouchsafed no reply at all , and I pretended to be too much occupied with its subject to have heard it .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 39]: After lingering a little while , during which I paid attention chiefly to Mrs Wilson , drawing her notice to the state of several of the books , I proposed we should have a peep at the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 31]: We went in , and , glancing over the walls I knew so well , I scarcely repressed an exclamation : I could not be mistaken in my own sword !
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 25]: There it hung , in the centre of the principal space -- in the same old sheath , split half-way up from the point !
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 13]: To the hilt hung an ivory label with a number upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 16]: I suppose I made some inarticulate sound , for Clara fixed her eyes upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 32]: I busied myself at once with a gorgeously hiked scimitar , which hung near , for I did not wish to talk about it then , and so escaped further remark .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 23]: From the armoury we went to the picture-gallery , where I found a good many pictures had been added to the collection .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 10]: They were all new and mostly brilliant in colour .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 35]: I was no judge , but I could not help feeling how crude and harsh they looked beside the mellowed tints of the paintings , chiefly portraits , among which they had been introduced .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 3]: ` Horrid !
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 6]: -- are n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 23]: said Clara , as if she divined my thoughts ; but I made no direct reply , unwilling to offend Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 22]: When we were once more on horseback , and walking across the grass , my companion was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 9]: ` Did you ever see such daubs ! '
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 17]: she said , making a wry face as at something sour enough to untune her nerves .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 8]: ` Those new pictures are simply frightful .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 23]: Any one of them would give me the jaundice in a week , if it were hung in our drawing-room . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 12]: I ca n't say I admire them , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 23]: ` And at all events they ought not to be on the same walls with those stately old ladies and gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 7]: ` Parvenus , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 6]: ` Quite in their place .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 9]: Pure Manchester taste -- educated on calico-prints . '
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 25]: ` If that is your opinion of the family , how do you account for their keeping everything so much in the old style ?
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 9]: They do n't seem to change anything . '
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 9]: ` All for their own honour and glory !
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 27]: The place is a testimony to the antiquity of the family of which they are a shoot run to seed -- and very ugly seed too !
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 20]: It 's enough to break one 's heart to think of such a glorious old place in such hands .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 9]: Did you ever see young Brotherton ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 8]: I knew him a little at college .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 7]: He 's a good-looking fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 14]: ` Would be if it were n't for the bad blood in him .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 5]: That comes out unmistakeably .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 5]: He 's vulgar . '
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 11]: ` Have you seen much of him , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 4]: ` Quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 29]: I never heard him say anything vulgar , or saw him do anything vulgar , but vulgar he is , and vulgar is every one of the family .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 37]: A man who is always aware of how rich he will be , and how good-looking he is , and what a fine match he would make , would look vulgar lying in his coffin . '
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 10]: ` You are positively caustic , Miss Coningham . '
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 9]: ` If you saw their house in Cheshire !
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 7]: But blessings be on the place !
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 9]: -- it 's the safety-valve for Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 34]: The natural Manchester passion for novelty and luxury finds a vent there , otherwise they could not keep their hands off it ; and what was best would be sure to go first .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 15]: Corchester House ought to be secured to the family by Act of Parliament . '
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 11]: ` Have you been to Corchester , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 9]: I was there for a week once . '
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 9]: ` And how did you like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 5]: ` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 5]: I was not comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 7]: I was always feeling too well-bred .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 9]: You never saw such colours in your life .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 14]: Their drawing-rooms are quite a happy family of the most quarrelsome tints . '
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 11]: ` How ever did they come into this property ? '
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 14]: ` They 're of the breed somehow -- a long way off though .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 17]: Should n't I like to see a new claimant come up and oust them after all !
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 11]: They have n't had it above five-and-twenty years or so .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 5]: Would n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 11]: ` The old man was kind to me once . '
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 5]: ` How was that ?
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 15]: I thought it was only through Mrs Wilson you knew anything of them . '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 9]: I told her the story of the apple .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 20]: ` Well , I do rather like old Sir Giles , ' she said , when I had done .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 14]: ` There 's a good deal of the rough country gentleman about him .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 10]: He 's a better man than his son anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 12]: Sons will succeed their fathers , though , unfortunately . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 18]: I do n't care who may succeed him , if only I could get back my sword .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 21]: It 's too bad , with an armoury like that , to take my one little ewe-lamb from me . '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 8]: Here I had another story to tell .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 27]: After many interruptions in the way of questions from my listener , I ended it with these words -- ` And -- will you believe me ?
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 24]: -- I saw the sword hanging in that armoury this afternoon -- close by that splendid hilt I pointed out to you . '
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 11]: ` How could you tell it among so many ? '
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 14]: ` Just as you could tell that white creature from this brown one .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 16]: I know it , hilt and scabbard , as well as a human face . '
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 11]: ` As well as mine , for instance ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 13]: I am surer of it than I was of you this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 8]: It has n't changed like you . '
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 15]: Our talk was interrupted by the appearance of a gentleman on horseback approaching us .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 30]: I thought at first it was Clara 's father , setting out for home , and coming to bid us good-bye ; but I soon saw I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 16]: Not , however , until he came quite close , did I recognize Geoffrey Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 15]: He took off his hat to my companion , and reined in his horse .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 16]: ` Are you going to give us in charge for trespassing , Mr Brotherton ? '
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 4]: said Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 18]: I should be happy to _ take _ you in charge on any pretence , Miss Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 8]: This is indeed an unexpected pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 7]: Here he looked in my direction .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 16]: he said , lifting his eyebrows , ' I thought I knew the old horse !
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 14]: What a nice cob _ you _ 've got , Miss Coningham . '
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 26]: He had not chosen to recognize me , of which I was glad , for I hardly knew how to order my behaviour to him .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 5]: I had forgotten nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 36]: But , ill as I liked him , I was forced to confess that he had greatly improved in appearance -- and manners too , notwithstanding his behaviour was as supercilious as ever to me .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 11]: ` Do you call her a cob , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 4]: said Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 11]: I should never have thought of calling her a cob .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 8]: -- She belongs to Mr Cumbermede . '
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 26]: he said again , arching his eyebrows as before , and looking straight at me as if he had never seen me in his life .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 12]: I think I succeeded in looking almost unaware of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 29]: At least so I tried to look , feeling quite thankful to Clara for defending my mare : to hear her called a cob was hateful to me .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 49]: After listening to a few more of his remarks upon her , made without the slightest reference to her owner , who was not three yards from her side , Clara asked him , in the easiest manner -- ` Shall you be at the county ball ? '
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 6]: ` When is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 5]: ` Next Thursday . '
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 7]: ` Are you going ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 5]: I hope so . '
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 12]: ` Then will you dance the first waltz with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 7]: ` No , Mr Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 14]: ` Then I am sorry to say I shall be in London . '
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 9]: ` When do you rejoin your regiment ? '
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 9]: I 've got a month 's leave . '
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 12]: ` Then why wo n't you be at the ball ? '
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 12]: ` Because you wo n't promise me the first waltz . '
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 27]: ` Well -- rather than the belles of Minstercombe should -- ring their sweet changes in vain , I suppose I must indulge you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 16]: A thousand thanks , ' he said , lifted his hat , and rode on .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 16]: My blood was in a cold boil -- if the phrase can convey an idea .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 33]: Clara rode on homewards without looking round , and I followed , keeping a few yards behind her , hardly thinking at all , my very brain seeming cold inside my skull .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 14]: There was small occasion as yet , some of my readers may think .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 10]: I can not help it -- so it was .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 30]: When we had gone in silence a couple of hundred yards or so , she glanced round at me with a quick sly half-look , and burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 19]: I was by her side in an instant : her laugh had dissolved the spell that bound me .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 5]: But she spoke first .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 7]: ` Well , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 8]: she said , with a slow interrogation .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 7]: ` Well , Miss Coningham ? '
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 9]: I rejoined , but bitterly , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 25]: she retorted sharply , looking up at me , full in the face , whether in real or feigned anger I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 24]: ` How could you talk _ of _ that fellow as you did , and then talk so _ to _ him ? '
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 12]: ` What right have you to put such questions to me ?
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 12]: I am not aware of any intimacy to justify it . '
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 7]: ` Then I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 8]: But my surprise remains the same . '
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 8]: ` Why , you silly boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 22]: she returned , laughing aloud , ` do n't you know he is , or will be , my feudal lord .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 9]: I am bound to be polite to him .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 14]: What would become of poor grandpapa if I were to give him offence ?
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 14]: Besides , I have been in the house with him for a week .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 11]: He 's not a Crichton ; but he dances well .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 11]: Are _ you _ going to the ball ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 6]: I never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 19]: I have not for weeks thought of anything but -- but -- my writing , till this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 13]: Now I fear I shall find it difficult to return to it .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 10]: It looks ages since I saddled the mare ! '
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 20]: ` But if you 're ever to be an author , it wo n't do to shut yourself up .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 13]: You ought to see as much of the world as you can .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 13]: I should strongly advise you to go to the ball . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 21]: I would willingly obey you -- but -- but -- I do n't know how to get a ticket . '
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 16]: if you would like to go , papa will have much pleasure in managing that .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 6]: I will ask him . '
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 13]: ` I 'm much obliged to you , ' I returned . '
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 9]: I should enjoy seeing Mr Brotherton dance . '
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 12]: She laughed again , but it was an oddly constrained laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 30]: ` It 's quite time I were at home , ' she said , and gave the mare the rein , increasing her speed as we approached the house .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 24]: Before I reached the little gate she had given her up to the gardener , who had been on the look-out for us .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 34]: ` Put on her own saddle , and bring the mare round at once , please , ' I called to the man , as he led her and the horse away together .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 10]: ` Wo n't you come in , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 7]: said Clara , kindly and seriously .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 19]: ` No , thank you , ' I returned ; for I was full of rage and jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 25]: To do myself justice , however , mingled with these was pity that such a girl should be so easy with such a man .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 12]: But I could not tell her what I knew of him .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 34]: Even if I _ could _ have done so , I dared not ; for the man who shows himself jealous must be readily believed capable of lying , or at least misrepresenting .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 25]: ` Then I must bid you good-evening , ' she said , as quietly as if we had been together only five minutes . '
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 17]: I am _ so _ much obliged to you for letting me ride your mare ! '
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 16]: She gave me a half-friendly , half-stately little bow , and walked into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 24]: In a few moments the gardener returned with the mare , and I mounted and rode home in anything but a pleasant mood .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 29]: Having stabled her , I roamed about the fields till it was dark , thinking for the first time in my life I preferred woods to open grass .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 18]: When I went in at length I did my best to behave as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 30]: My uncle must , however , have seen that something was amiss , but he took no notice , for he never forced or even led up to confidences .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 47]: I retired early to bed , and passed an hour or two of wretchedness , thinking over everything that had happened -- the one moment calling her a coquette , and the next ransacking a fresh corner of my brain to find fresh excuse for her .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 29]: At length I was able to arrive at the conclusion that I did not understand her , and having given in so far , I soon fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 3]: A DISAPPOINTMENT .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 23]: I trust it will not be regarded as a sign of shallowness of nature that I rose in the morning comparatively calm .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 41]: Clara was to me as yet only the type of general womanhood , around which the amorphous loves of my manhood had begun to gather , not the one woman whom the individual man in me had chosen and loved .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 39]: How could I _ love _ that which I did not yet know : she was but the heroine of my objective life , as projected from me by my imagination -- not the love of my being .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 54]: Therefore , when the wings of sleep had fanned the motes from my brain , I was cool enough , notwithstanding an occasional tongue of indignant flame from the ashes of last night 's fire , to sit down to my books , and read with tolerable attention my morning portion of Plato .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 18]: But when I turned to my novel , I found I was not master of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 56]: My hero too was in love and in trouble ; and after I had written a sentence and a half , I found myself experiencing the fate of Heine when he roused the Sphinx of past love by reading his own old verses : -- Lebendig ward das Marmorbild , Der Stein begann zu ächzen .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 25]: In a few moments I was pacing up and down the room , eager to burn my moth-wings yet again in the old fire .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 22]: And by the way , I can not help thinking that the moths enjoy their fate , and die in ecstasies .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 24]: I was , however , too shy to venture on a call that very morning : I should both feel and look foolish .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 11]: But there was no more work to be done then .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 53]: I hurried to the stable , saddled my mare , and set out for a gallop across the farm , but towards the high road leading to Minstercombe , in the opposite direction , that is , from the Hall , which I flattered myself was to act in a strong-minded manner .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 16]: There were several fences and hedges between , but I cleared them all without discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 8]: The last jump was into a lane .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 22]: We , that is my mare and I , had scarcely alighted , when my ears were invaded by a shout .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 15]: The voice was the least welcome I could have heard , that of Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 17]: I turned and saw him riding up the hill , with a lady by his side .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 4]: ` Hillo ! '
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 18]: he cried , almost angrily , ` you do n't deserve to have such a cob . '
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 11]: -LRB- He _ would _ call her a cob . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 9]: ` You do n't know-how to use her .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 11]: To jump her on to the hard like that ! '
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 6]: It was Clara with him !
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 9]: -- on the steady stiff old brown horse !
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 40]: My first impulse was to jump my mare over the opposite fence , and take no heed , of them , but clearly it was not to be attempted , for the ground fell considerably on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 11]: My next thought was to ride away and leave them .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 38]: My third was one which some of my readers will judge Quixotic , but I have a profound reverence for the Don -- and that not merely because I have so often acted as foolishly as he .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 17]: This last I proceeded to carry out , and lifting-my hat , rode to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 37]: Taking no notice whatever of Brotherton , I addressed Clara -- in what I fancied a distant and dignified manner , which she might , if she pleased , attribute to the presence of her companion .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 21]: ` Miss Coningham , ' I said , ` will you allow me the honour of offering you my mare ?
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 7]: She will carry you better . '
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 26]: ` You are very kind , Mr Cumbermede , ' she returned in a similar tone , but with a sparkle in her eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 7]: I am greatly obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 21]: I can not pretend to prefer old crossbones to the beautiful creature which gave me so much pleasure yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 16]: I was off and by her side in a moment , helping her to dismount .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 19]: I did not even look at Brotherton , though I felt he was staring like an equestrian statue .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 38]: While I shifted the saddles Clara broke the silence , which I was in too great an inward commotion to heed , by asking -- ` What is the name of your beauty , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 7]: ` Lilith , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 6]: ` What a pretty name !
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 6]: I never heard it before .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 14]: Is it after any one -- any public character , I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 18]: ` Quite a public character , ' I returned -- ` Adam 's first wife . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 13]: I never heard he had two , ' she rejoined , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 7]: ` The Jews say he had .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 28]: She is a demon now , and the pest of married women and their babies , ' ` What a horrible name to give your mare ! '
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 7]: ` The name is pretty enough .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 19]: And what does it matter what the woman was , so long as she was beautiful . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 23]: I do n't quite agree with you there , ' she returned , with what I chose to consider a forced laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 18]: By this time her saddle was firm on Lilith , and in an instant she was mounted .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 12]: Brotherton moved to ride on , and the mare followed him .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 4]: Clara looked back .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 21]: ` You will catch us up in a moment , ' she said , possibly a little puzzled between us .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 17]: I was busy tightening my girths , and fumbled over the job more than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 16]: Brotherton was several yards ahead , and she was walking the mare slowly after him .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 27]: I made her no answer , but mounted , and rode in the opposite direction ; It was rude of course , but I did it .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 26]: I could not have gone with them , and was afraid , if I told her so , she would dismount and refuse the mare .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 37]: In a tumult of feeling I rode on without looking behind me , careless whither -- how long I can not tell , before I woke up to find I did not know where I was .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 22]: I must ride on till I came to some place I knew , or met some one who could tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 35]: Lane led into lane , buried betwixt deep banks and lofty hedges , or passing through small woods , until I ascended a rising ground , whence I got a view of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 39]: At once its features began to dawn upon me : I was close to the village of Aldwick , where I had been at school , and in a few minutes I rode into its wide straggling street .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 10]: Not a mark of change had passed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 17]: There were the same dogs about the doors , and the same cats in the windows .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 35]: The very ferns in the chinks of the old draw-well appeared the same ; and the children had not grown an inch since first I drove into the place marvelling at its wondrous activity .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 12]: The sun was hot , and my horse seemed rather tired .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 78]: I was in no mood to see any one , and besides had no pleasant recollections of my last visit to Mr Elder , so I drew up at the door of the little inn , and having sent my horse to the stable for an hour 's rest and a feed of oats , went into the sanded parlour , ordered a glass of ale , and sat staring at the china shepherdesses on the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 23]: I see them now , the ugly things , as plainly as if that had been an hour of the happiest reflections .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 35]: I thought I was miserable , but I know now that , although I was much disappointed , and everything looked dreary and uninteresting about me , I was a long way off misery .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 31]: Indeed , the passing vision of a neat unbonneted village girl on her way to the well was attractive enough still to make me rise and go to the window .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 56]: While watching , as she wound up the long chain , for the appearance of the familiar mossy bucket , dripping diamonds , as it gleamed out of the dark well into the sudden sunlight , I heard the sound of horse 's hoofs , and turned to see what kind of apparition would come .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 11]: Presently it appeared , and made straight for the inn .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 6]: The rider was Mr Coningham !
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 28]: I drew back to escape his notice , but his quick eye had caught sight of me , for he came into the room with outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 15]: ` We are fated to meet , Mr Cumbermede , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 19]: I only stopped to give my horse some meal and water , and had no intention of dismounting .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 2]: Ale ?
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 18]: I 'll have a glass of ale too , ' he added , ringing the bell . '
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 21]: I think I 'll let him have a feed , and have a mouthful of bread and cheese myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 42]: He went out , and had I suppose gone to see that his horse had his proper allowance of oats , for when he returned he said merrily : ` What have you done with my daughter , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 14]: ` Why should you think me responsible for her , Mr Conningham ? '
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 7]: I asked , attempting a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 55]: No doubt he detected the attempt in the smile , for he looked at me with a sharpened expression of the eyes , as he answered -- still in a merry tone -- ` When I saw her last , she was mounted on your horse , and you were on my father 's .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 20]: I find you still on my father 's horse , and your own -- with the lady -- nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 10]: Have I made out a case of suspicion ? '
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 40]: ` It is I who have cause of complaint , ' I returned -- ` who have neither lady nor mare -- unless indeed you imagine I have in the case of the latter made a good exchange . '
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 17]: ` Hardly that , I imagine , if yours is half so good as she looks .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 11]: But , seriously , have you seen Clara to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 11]: I told him the facts as lightly as I could .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 22]: When I had finished , he stared at me with an expression which for the moment I avoided attempting to interpret .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 8]: ` On horseback with Mr Brotherton ? '
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 15]: he said , uttering the words as if every syllable had been separately italicized .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 16]: ` You will find it as I say , ' I replied , feeling offended .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 36]: ` My dear boy -- excuse my freedom , ' he returned -- ' I am nearly three times your age -- you do not imagine I doubt a hair 's breadth of your statement !
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 6]: But -- the giddy goose !
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 8]: -- how could you be so silly ?
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 4]: Pardon me again .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 6]: Your unselfishness is positively amusing !
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 22]: To hand over your horse to her , and then ride away all by yourself on that -- respectable stager ! '
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 12]: ` Do n't abuse the old horse , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 16]: ` He _ is _ respectable , and has been more in his day . '
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 5]: ` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 12]: But for the life of me I can not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 9]: Mr Cumbermede , I am sorry for you .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 13]: I should not advise you to choose the law for a profession .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 21]: The man who does not regard his own rights will hardly do for an adviser in the affairs of others .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 16]: ` You were not going to consult me , Mr Coningham , were you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: I said , now able at length to laugh without effort .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 12]: ` Not quite that , ' he returned , also laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 20]: ` But a right , you know , is one of the most serious things in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 11]: It seemed irrelevant to the trifling character of the case .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 16]: I could not understand why he should regard the affair as of such importance . '
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 33]: I have been in the way of thinking , ' I said , ` that one of the advantages of having rights was that you could part with them when you pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 14]: You 're not bound to insist on your rights , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 27]: ` Certainly you would not subject yourself to a criminal action by foregoing them , but you might suggest to your friends a commission of lunacy .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 6]: I see how it is .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 7]: That is your uncle all over !
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 12]: _ He _ was never a man of the world . '
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 9]: ` You are right there , Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 13]: It is the last epithet any one would give my uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 20]: ` And the first any one would give _ me _ , you imply , Mr Cumbermede . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 10]: I had no such intention , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 8]: ` That would have been rude . '
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 6]: ` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 11]: _ I _ should have taken it as a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 25]: The man who does not care about his rights , depend upon it , will be made a tool of by those that do .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 13]: If he is not a spoon already , he will become one .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 18]: I should n't have _ iffed _ it at all if I had n't known you . '
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 14]: ` And you do n't want to be rude to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 31]: A little experience will set _ you _ all right ; and that you are in a fair chance of getting if you push your fortune as a literary man .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 6]: But I must be off .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 11]: I hope we may have another chat before long . '
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 17]: He finished his ale , rose , bade me good-bye , and went to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 16]: As soon as he was out of sight , I also mounted and rode homewards .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 17]: By the time I reached the gate of the park , my depression had nearly vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 24]: The comforting power of sun and shadow , of sky and field , of wind and motion , had restored me to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 40]: With a side glance at the windows of the cottage as I passed , and the glimpse of a bright figure seated in the drawing-room window , I made for the stable , and found my Lilith waiting me .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 22]: Once more I shifted my saddle , and rode home , without even another glance at the window as I passed .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 24]: A day or two after , I received from Mr Coningham a ticket for the county ball , accompanied by a kind note .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 18]: I returned it at once with the excuse that I feared incapacitating myself for work by dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 17]: Henceforward I avoided the park , and did not again see Clara before leaving for London .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 46]: I had a note from her , thanking me for Lilith , and reproaching me for having left her to the company of Mr Brotherton , which I thought cool enough , seeing they had set out together without the slightest expectation of meeting me .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 14]: I returned a civil answer , and there was an end of it .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 23]: I must again say for myself that it was not mere jealousy of Brotherton that led me to act as I did .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 54]: I could not and would not get over the contradiction between the way in which she had spoken _ of _ him , and the way in which she spoke _ to _ him , followed by her accompanying him in the long ride to which the state of my mare bore witness .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 16]: I concluded that , although she might mean no harm , she was not truthful .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 24]: To talk of a man with such contempt , and then behave to him with such frankness , appeared to me altogether unjustifiable .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 56]: At the same time their mutual familiarity pointed to some foregone intimacy , in which , had I been so inclined , I might have found some excuse for her , seeing she might have altered her opinion of him , and might yet find it very difficult to alter the tone of their intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 3]: IN LONDON .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 81]: My real object being my personal history in relation to certain facts and events , I must , in order to restrain myself from that discursiveness the impulse to which is an urging of the historical as well as the artistic Satan , even run the risk of appearing to have been blind to many things going on around me which must have claimed a large place had I been writing an autobiography instead of a distinct portion of one .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 29]: I set out with my manuscript in my portmanteau , and a few pounds in my pocket , determined to cost my uncle as little as I could .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 29]: I well remember the dreariness of London , as I entered it on the top of a coach , in the closing darkness of a late Autumn afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 15]: The shops were not yet all lighted , and a drizzly rain was falling .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 30]: But these outer influences hardly got beyond my mental skin , for I had written to Charley , and hoped to find him waiting for me at the coach-office .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 14]: Nor was I disappointed , and in a moment all discomfort was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 11]: He took me to his chambers in the New Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 16]: I found him looking better , and apparently , for him , in good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 35]: It was soon arranged , at his entreaty , that for the present I should share his sitting-room , and have a bed put up for me in a closet he did not want .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 15]: The next day I called upon certain publishers and left with them my manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 39]: Its fate is of no consequence here , and I did not then wait to know it , but at once began to fly my feather at lower game , writing short papers and tales for the magazines .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 72]: I had a little success from the first ; and although the surroundings of my new abode were dreary enough , although , now and then , especially when the Winter sun shone bright into the court , I longed for one peep into space across the field that now itself lay far in the distance , I soon settled to my work , and found the life an enjoyable one .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 45]: To work beside Charley the most of the day , and go with him in the evening to some place of amusement , or to visit some of the men in chambers about us , was for the time a satisfactory mode of existence .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 13]: I soon told him the story of my little passage with Clara .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 28]: During the narrative he looked uncomfortable , and indeed troubled , but as soon as he found I had given up the affair , his countenance brightened .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 18]: ` I 'm very glad you 've got over it so well , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 13]: I think I 've had a good deliverance , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 5]: He made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 19]: Neither did his face reveal his thoughts , for I could not read the confused expression it bore .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 54]: That he should not fall in with my judgment would never have surprised me , for he always hung back from condemnation , partly , I presume , from being even morbidly conscious of his own imperfections , and partly that his prolific suggestion supplied endless possibilities to explain or else perplex everything .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 27]: I had been often even annoyed by his use of the most refined invention to excuse , as I thought , behaviour the most palpably wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 15]: I believe now it was rather to account for it than to excuse it .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 31]: ` Well , Charley , ' I would say in such a case , ' I am sure _ you _ would never have done such a thing . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 43]: I can not guarantee my own conduct for a moment , ' he would answer ; or , taking the other tack , would reply : ` Just for that reason I can not believe the man would have done it . '
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 13]: But the oddity in the present case was that he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 51]: I should , however , have forgotten all about it , but that after some time I began to observe that as often as I alluded to Clara -- which was not often -- he contrived to turn the remark aside , and always without saying a syllable about her .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 34]: The conclusion I came to was that , while he shrunk from condemnation , he was at the same time unwilling to disturb the present serenity of my mind by defending her conduct .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 19]: Early in the Spring , an unpleasant event occurred , of which I might have foreseen the possibility .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 14]: One morning I was alone , working busily , when the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 9]: ` Why , Charley -- back already ! '
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 10]: I exclaimed , going on to finish my sentence .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 17]: Receiving no answer , I looked up from my paper , and started to my feet .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 13]: Mr Osborne stood before me , scrutinizing me with severe grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 20]: I think he knew me from the first , but I was sufficiently altered to make it doubtful . '
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 21]: I beg your pardon , ' he said coldly -- ' I thought these were Charles Osborne 's chambers . '
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 8]: And he turned to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 28]: ` They _ are _ his chambers , Mr Osborne , ' I replied , recovering myself with an effort , and looking him in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 15]: ` My son had not informed me that he shared them with another . '
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 11]: ` We are very old friends , Mr Osborne . '
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 11]: He made no answer , but stood regarding me fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 14]: ` You do not remember me , sir , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 7]: I am Wilfrid Cumbermede . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 8]: I have cause to remember you . '
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 9]: ` Will you not sit down , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 15]: Charley will be home in less than an hour -- I quite expect . '
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 12]: Again he turned his back as if about to leave me .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 24]: ` If my presence is disagreeable to you , ' I said , annoyed at his rudeness , ' I will go . '
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 9]: ` As you please , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 20]: I left my papers , caught up my hat , and went out of the room and the house .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 13]: I said _ good morning _ , but he made no return .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 9]: Not until nearly eight o'clock did I re-enter .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 15]: I had of course made up my mind that Charley and I must part .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 16]: When I opened the door , I thought at first there was no one there .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 12]: There were no lights , and the fire had burned low .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 8]: ` Is that you , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 7]: He was lying on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 9]: ` Yes , Charley , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 7]: ` Come in , old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 27]: The avenger of blood is not behind me , ' he said , in a mocking tone , as he rose and came to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 17]: ` I 've been having such a dose of damnation -- all for your sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 8]: ` I 'm very sorry , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 9]: But I think we are both to blame .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 8]: Your father ought to have been told .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 18]: You see day after day went by , and -- somehow -- ' ` Tut , tut !
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 3]: never mind .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 21]: What _ does _ it matter -- except that it 's a disgrace to be dependent on such a man ?
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 10]: I wish I had the courage to starve . '
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 8]: ` He 's your father , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 6]: Nothing can alter that . '
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 8]: ` That 's the misery of it .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 10]: And then to tell people God is their father !
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 17]: If he 's like mine , he 's done us a mighty favour in creating us !
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 10]: I ca n't say I feel grateful for it .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 7]: I must turn out to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 5]: ` No , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 16]: The place has no attraction for me without you , and it was yours first .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 11]: Besides , I ca n't afford to pay so much .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 6]: I will find another to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 16]: But we shall see each other often , and perhaps get through more work apart .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 13]: I hope he did n't insist on your never seeing me . '
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 26]: ` He did try it on ; but there I stuck fast , threatening to vanish and scramble for my living as I best might .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 19]: I told him you were a far better man than I , and did me nothing but good .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 6]: But that only made the .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 9]: matter worse , proving your influence over me .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 5]: Let 's drop it .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 5]: It 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 8]: Let 's go to the Olympic . '
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 44]: The next day I looked for a lodging in Camden Town , attracted by the probable cheapness , and by the grass in the Regent 's Park ; and having found a decent place , took my things away while Charley was out .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 40]: I had not got them , few as they were , in order in my new quarters before he made his appearance ; and as long as I was there few days passed on which we did not meet .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 38]: One evening he walked in , accompanied by a fine-looking young fellow , whom I thought I must know , and presently recognized as Home , our old school-fellow , with whom I had fought in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 18]: We had become good friends before we parted , and Charley and he had met repeatedly since .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 10]: ` What are you doing now , Home ? '
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 14]: ` I 've just taken deacon 's orders , ' he answered . '
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 12]: A friend of my father 's has promised me a living .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 9]: I 've been hanging-about quite long enough now .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 12]: A fellow ought to do something for his existence . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 23]: I ca n't think how a strong fellow like you can take to mumbling prayers and reading sermons , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 19]: ` It ai n't nice , ' said Home , ` but it 's a very respectable profession .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 13]: There are viscounts in it , and lots of honourables . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 11]: I dare say , ' returned Charley , with drought .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 25]: ` But a nerveless creature like me , who ca n't even hit straight from the shoulder , would be good enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 8]: A giant like you , Home ! '
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 32]: by-the-by , Osborne , ' said Home , not in love with the prospect , and willing to turn the conversation , ' I thought you were a church-calf yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 21]: ` Honestly , Home , I do n't know whether it is n't the biggest of all big humbugs . '
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 7]: ` Oh , but -- Osborne !
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 61]: -- it ai n't the thing , you know , to talk like that of a profession adopted by so many great men fit to honour any profession , ' returned Home , who was not one of the brightest of mortals , and was jealous for the profession just in as much as it was destined for his own .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 19]: ` Either the profession honours the men , or the men dishonour themselves , ' said Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 30]: I believe it claims to have been founded by a man called Jesus Christ , if such a man ever existed except in the fancy of his priesthood . '
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 34]: ` Well , really , ' expostulated Home , looking , I must say , considerably shocked , ' I should n't have expected that from the son of a clergyman ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 7]: I could n't help my father .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 14]: I was n't consulted , ' said Charley , with an uncomfortable grin .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 16]: ` But , at any rate , my father fancies he believes all the story .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 7]: I fancy I do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 10]: ` Then you 're an infidel , Osborne . '
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 3]: ` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 9]: Do you think that so very horrible ? '
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 6]: ` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 14]: Tom Paine , and all the rest of them , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 20]: ` Well , Home , I 'll tell you one thing I think worse than being an infidel . '
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 6]: ` What is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 11]: ` Taking to the Church for a living . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: I do n't see that . '
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 26]: ` Either the so-called truths it advocates are things to live and die for , or they are the veriest old wives ' fables going .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 16]: Do you know who was the first to do what you are about now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 5]: I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 10]: I 'm not up in Church history yet . '
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 6]: ` It was Judas . '
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 16]: I am not sure that Charley was right , but that is what he said .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 29]: I was taking no part in the conversation , but listening eagerly , with a strong suspicion that Charley had been leading Home to this very point . '
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 9]: A man must live , ' said Home .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 21]: ` That 's precisely what I take it Judas said : for my part I do n't see it . '
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 7]: ` Do n't see what ? '
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 7]: ` That a man must live .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 23]: It would be a far more incontrovertible assertion that a man must die -- and a more comfortable one , too . '
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 13]: ` Upon my word , I do n't understand you , Osborne !
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 12]: You make a fellow feel deuced queer with your remarks . '
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 23]: ` At all events , you will allow that the first of them -- they call them apostles , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 15]: -- did n't take to preaching the gospel for the sake of a living .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 24]: What a satire on the whole kit of them that word _ living _ , so constantly in all their mouths , is !
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 33]: It seems to me that Messrs Peter and Paul and Matthew , and all the rest of them , forsook their livings for a good chance of something rather the contrary . '
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 19]: ` Then it _ was _ true -- what they said about you at Forest 's ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 38]: I do n't know what they said , ' returned Charley ; ` but before I would pretend to believe what I did n't -- ' ` But I _ do _ believe it , Osborne . '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 9]: ` May I ask on what grounds ? '
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 7]: ` Why -- everybody does . '
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 19]: ` That would be no reason , even if it were a fact , which it is not .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 21]: You believe it , or rather , choose to think you believe it , because you 've been told it .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 30]: Sooner than pretend to teach what I have never learned , and be looked up to as a pattern of godliness , I would ` list in the ranks .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 14]: There , at least , a man might earn an honest living . '
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 4]: ` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 9]: You do make a fellow feel uncomfortable ! '
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 3]: repeated Home .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 23]: ` You 've got such a -- such an uncompromising way of saying things -- to use a mild expression . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 18]: I think it 's a sneaking thing to do , and unworthy of a gentleman . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 23]: I do n't see what right you 've got to bully me in that way , ' said Home , getting angry .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 6]: It was time to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 21]: ` Charley is so afraid of being dishonest , Home , ' I said , ` that he is rude .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 10]: -- You are rude now , Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 13]: I beg your pardon , Home , ' exclaimed Charley at once .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 7]: ` Oh , never mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 6]: returned Home with gloomy good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 13]: ` You ought to make allowance , Charley , ' I pursued .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 32]: ` When a man has been accustomed all his life to hear things spoken of in a certain way , he can not help having certain notions to start with . '
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 28]: ` If I thought as Osborne does , ' said Home , ' I _ would _ sooner ` list than go into the Church . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 48]: I confess , ' I rejoined , ' I do not see how any one can take orders , unless he not only loves God with all his heart , but receives the story of the New Testament as a revelation of him , precious beyond utterance .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 18]: To the man who accepts it so , the calling is the noblest in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 11]: The others were silent , and the conversation turned away .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 18]: From whatever cause , Home did not go into the Church , but died fighting in India .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 9]: He soon left us -- Charley remaining behind .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 8]: ` What a hypocrite I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 41]: he exclaimed ; -- ` following a profession in which I must often , if I have any practice at all , defend what I know to be wrong , and seek to turn justice from its natural course . '
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 22]: ` But you ca n't always know that your judgment is right , even if it should be against your client .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 25]: I heard an eminent barrister say once that he had come out of the court convinced by the arguments of the opposite counsel . '
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 8]: ` And having gained the case ? '
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 8]: ` That I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 21]: ` He went in believing his own side anyhow , and that made it all right for him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 7]: I do n't know that either .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 21]: His private judgment was altered , but whether it was for or against his client , I do not remember .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 25]: The fact , however , shows that one might do a great wrong by refusing a client whom he judged in the wrong . '
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 19]: ` On the contrary , to refuse a brief on such grounds would be best for all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 28]: Not believing in it , you could not do your best , and might be preventing one who would believe in it from taking it up . '
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 13]: ` The man might not get anybody to take it up . '
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 25]: ` Then there would be little reason to expect that a jury charged under ordinary circumstances would give a verdict in his favour . '
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 15]: ` But it would be for the barristers to constitute themselves the judges . '
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 11]: ` Yes -- of their own conduct -- only that .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 5]: There I am again !
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 26]: The finest ideas about the right thing -- and going on all the same , with open eyes running my head straight into the noose !
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 12]: Wilfrid , I 'm one of the weakest animals in creation .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 15]: What if you found at last that I had been deceiving _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 6]: What would you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 11]: ` Nothing , Charley -- to any one else . '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 12]: ` What would you say to yourself , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 8]: I know what I should do . '
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 19]: ` Try to account for it , and find as many reasons as I could to justify you .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 17]: That is , I would do just as you do for every one but yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 24]: He was silent -- plainly from emotion , which I attributed to his pleasure at the assurance of the strength of my friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 8]: ` Suppose you could find none ? '
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 9]: he said , recovering himself a little . '
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 10]: I should still believe there _ were _ such .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 12]: _ Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner _ , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 5]: He brightened at this .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 10]: ` You _ are _ a friend , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 7]: What a strange condition mine is !
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 37]: -- for ever feeling I could do this and that difficult thing , were it to fall in my way , and yet constantly failing in the simplest duties -- even to that of common politeness .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 8]: I behaved like a brute to Home .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 17]: He 's a fine fellow , and only wants to see a thing to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 14]: _ I _ see it well enough , and do n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 10]: Wilfrid , I shall come to a bad end .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 16]: When it comes , mind I told you so , and blame nobody but myself .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 6]: I mean what I say .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 5]: ` Nonsense , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 23]: It 's only that you have n't active work enough , and get morbid with brooding over the germs of things . '
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 12]: ` Oh , Wilfrid , how beautiful a life might be !
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 10]: Just look at that one in the New Testament !
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 10]: Why should n't _ I _ be like that ?
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 8]: _ I _ do n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 7]: I feel as if I could .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 13]: But I 'm not , you see -- and never shall be .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 13]: I 'm selfish , and ill-tempered , and -- ' ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 2]: Charley !
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 14]: There never was a less selfish or better-tempered fellow in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 21]: ` Do n't make me believe that , Wilfrid , or I shall hate the world as well as myself .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 10]: It 's all my hypocrisy makes you think so .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 23]: Because I am ashamed of what I am , and manage to hide it pretty well , you think me a saint .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 8]: That is heaping damnation on me . '
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 11]: ` Take a pipe , Charley , and shut up .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 5]: That 's rubbish ! '
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 25]: I doubt much if it was what I ought to have said , but I was alarmed for the consequences of such brooding . '
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 21]: I wonder what the world would be like if every one considered himself acting up to his own ideal ! '
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 21]: ` If he was acting so , then it would do the world no harm that he knew it . '
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 24]: ` But his ideal must then be a low one , and that would do himself and everybody the worst kind of harm .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 12]: The greatest men have always thought the least of themselves . '
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 14]: ` Yes , but that was because they _ were _ the greatest .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 26]: A man may think little of himself just for the reason that he _ is _ little , and ca n't help knowing it . '
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 11]: ` Then it 's a mercy he does know it !
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 10]: for most small people think much of themselves . '
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 32]: ` But to know it -- and to feel all the time you ought to be and could be something very different , and yet never get a step nearer it !
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 6]: That is to be miserable .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 9]: Still it is a mercy to know it .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 8]: There is always a last help . '
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 15]: I mistook what he meant , and thought it well to say no more .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 19]: After smoking a pipe or two , he was quieter , and left me with a merry remark .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 38]: One lovely evening in Spring , I looked from my bed-room window , and saw the red sunset burning in the thin branches of the solitary poplar that graced the few feet of garden behind the house .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 38]: It drew me out to the park , where the trees were all in young leaf , each with its shadow stretching away from its foot , like its longing to reach its kind across dividing space .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 40]: The grass was like my own grass at home , and I went wandering over it in all the joy of the new Spring , which comes every year to our hearts as well as to their picture outside .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 43]: The workmen were at that time busy about the unfinished botanical gardens , and I wandered thitherward , lingering about , and pondering and inventing , until the sun was long withdrawn , and the shades of night had grown very brown .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 39]: I was at length sauntering slowly home to put a few finishing touches to a paper I had been at work upon all day , when something about a young couple in front of me attracted my attention .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 20]: They were walking arm in arm , talking eagerly , but so low that I heard only a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 29]: I did not quicken my pace , yet was gradually gaining upon them , when suddenly the conviction started up in my mind that the gentleman was Charley .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 20]: I could not mistake his back , or the stoop of his shoulders as he bent towards his companion .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 41]: I was so certain of him that I turned at once from the road , and wandered away across the grass : if he did not choose to tell me about the lady , I had no right to know .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 14]: But I confess to a strange trouble that he had left me out .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 27]: I comforted myself , however , with the thought that perhaps when we next met he would explain , or at least break , the silence .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 17]: After about an hour , he entered , in an excited mood , merry but uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 37]: I tried to behave as if I knew nothing , but could not help feeling much disappointed when he left me without a word of his having had a second reason for being in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 33]: What effect the occurrence might have had , whether the cobweb veil of which I was now aware between us would have thickened to opacity or not , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 8]: I dare not imagine that it might .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 19]: I rather hope that by degrees my love would have got the victory , and melted it away .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 13]: But now came a cloud which swallowed every other in my firmament .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 33]: The next morning brought a letter from my aunt , telling me that my uncle had had a stroke , as she called it , and at that moment was lying insensible .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 19]: I put my affairs in order at once , and Charley saw me away by the afternoon coach .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: It was a dreary journey .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 28]: I loved my uncle with perfect confidence and profound veneration , a result of the faithful and open simplicity with which he had always behaved towards me .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 37]: If he were taken away , and already he might be gone , I should be lonely indeed , for on whom besides could I depend with anything like the trust which I reposed in him ?
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 34]: For , conceitedly or not , I had always felt that Charley rather depended on me -- that I had rather to take care of him than to look for counsel from him .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 6]: The weary miles rolled away .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 8]: Early in the morning we reached Minstercombe .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 13]: There I got a carriage , and at once continued my journey .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 2]: CHANGES .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 25]: I met no one at the house-door , or in the kitchen , and walked straight up the stair to my uncle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 27]: The blinds were down , and the curtains were drawn , and I could but just see the figure of my aunt seated beside the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 29]: She rose , and , without a word of greeting , made way for me to approach the form which lay upon it stretched out straight and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 56]: The conviction that I was in the presence of death seized me ; but instead of the wretchedness of heart and soul which I had expected to follow the loss of my uncle , a something deeper than any will of my own asserted itself , and as it were took the matter from me .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 41]: It was as if my soul avoided the sorrow of separation by breaking with the world of material things , asserting the shadowy nature of all the visible , and choosing its part with the something which had passed away .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 33]: It was as if my deeper self said to my outer consciousness : ' I too am of the dead -- one with them , whether they live or are no more .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 91]: For a little while I am shut out from them , and surrounded with things that seem : let me gaze on the picture while it lasts ; dream or no dream , let me live in it according to its laws , and await what will come next ; if an awaking , it is well : if only a perfect because dreamless sleep , I shall not be able to lament the endless separation -- but while I know myself , I will hope for something better . '
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 23]: Like this , at least , was the blossom into which , under my after-brooding , the bud of that feeling broke .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 10]: I laid my hand upon my uncle 's forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 19]: It was icy cold , just like my grannie 's when my aunt had made me touch it .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 42]: And I knew that my uncle was gone , that the slow tide of the eternal ocean had risen while he lay motionless within the wash of its waves , and had floated him away from the shore of our world .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 23]: I took the hand of my aunt , who stood like a statue behind me , and led her from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 17]: ` He is gone , aunt , ' I said , as calmly as I could .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 19]: She made no reply , but gently withdrew her hand from mine , and returned into the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 27]: I stood a few moments irresolute , but reverence for her sorrow prevailed , and I went down the stair and seated myself by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 19]: There the servant told me that my uncle had never moved since they laid him in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 23]: Soon after the doctor arrived , and went up-stairs ; but returned in a few minutes , only to affirm the fact .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 23]: I went again to the room , and found my aunt lying with her face on the bosom of the dead man .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 36]: She allowed me to draw her away , but when I would have led her down , she turned aside and sought her own chamber , where she remained for the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 9]: I will not linger over that miserable time .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 38]: Greatly as I revered my uncle , I was not prepared to find how much he had been respected , and was astonished at the number of faces I had never seen which followed to the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 41]: Amongst them were the Coninghams , father and son ; but except by a friendly grasp of the hand , and a few words of condolence , neither interrupted the calm depression rather than grief in which I found myself .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 21]: When I returned home , there was with my aunt a married sister , whom I had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 26]: Up to this time she had shown an arid despair , and been regardless of everything about her ; but now she was in tears .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 126]: I left them together , and wandered for hours up and down the lonely playground of my childhood , thinking of many things -- most of all , how strange it was that , if there were a _ hereafter _ for us , we should know positively nothing concerning it ; that not a whisper should cross the invisible line ; that the something which had looked from its windows so lovingly should have in a moment withdrawn , by some back-way unknown either to itself or us , into a region of which all we can tell is that thence no prayers and no tears will entice it to lift for an instant again the fallen curtain , and look out once more .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 52]: Why should not God , I thought , if a God there be , permit one single return to each , that so the friends left behind in the dark might be sure that death was not the end , and so live in the world as not of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 39]: -LSB- Illustration : I went again to the room , and found my aunt lying with her face on the bosom of the dead man -RSB- When I re-entered , I found my aunt looking a little cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 26]: She was even having something to eat with her sister -- an elderly country-looking woman , the wife of a farmer in a distant shire .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 52]: Their talk had led them back to old times , to their parents and the friends of their childhood ; and the memory of the long dead had comforted her a little over the recent loss ; for all true hearts death is a uniting , not a dividing power . '
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 13]: I suppose you will be going back to London , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 17]: said my aunt , who had already been persuaded to pay her sister a visit . '
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 10]: I think I had better , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 35]: ` When I have a chance of publishing a book , I should like to come and write it , or at least finish it , here , if you will let me . '
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 9]: ` The place is your own , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 13]: Of course I shall be very glad to have you here . '
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 17]: ` The place is yours as much as mine , aunt , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 16]: I ca n't bear to think that my uncle has no right over it still .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 25]: I believe he has , and therefore it is yours just the same -- not to mention my own wishes in the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 35]: She made no reply , and I saw that both she and her sister were shocked either at my mentioning the dead man , or at my supposing he had any earthly rights left .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 33]: The next day they set out together , leaving in the house the wife of the head man at the farm , to attend to me until I should return to town .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 65]: I had purposed to set out the following morning , but I found myself enjoying so much the undisturbed possession of the place , that I remained there for ten days ; and when I went , it was with the intention of making it my home as soon as I might : I had grown enamoured of the solitude so congenial to labour .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 37]: Before I left I arranged my uncle 's papers , and in doing so found several early sketches which satisfied me that he might have distinguished himself in literature if his fate had led him thitherward .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 26]: Having given the house in charge to my aunt 's deputy , Mrs Herbert , I at length returned to my lodging in Camden Town .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 24]: There I found two letters waiting me , the one announcing the serious illness of my aunt , and the other her death .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 7]: The latter was two days old .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 42]: I wrote to express my sorrow , and excuse my apparent neglect , and having made a long journey to see her also laid in the earth , I returned to my old home , in order to make fresh arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 2]: PROPOSALS .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 16]: Mrs Herbert attended me during the forenoon , but left me after my early dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 35]: I made my tea for myself , and a tankard filled from a barrel of ale of my uncle 's brewing , with a piece of bread and cheese , was my unvarying supper .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 18]: The first night I felt very lonely , almost indeed what the Scotch call _ eerie _ .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 54]: The place , although inseparably interwoven with my earliest recollections , drew back and stood apart from me -- a thing to be thought about ; and , in the ancient house , amidst the lonely field , I felt like a ghost condemned to return and live the vanished time over again .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 35]: I had had a fire lighted in my own room ; for , although the air was warm outside , the thick stone walls seemed to retain the chilly breath of the last Winter .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 16]: The silent rooms that filled the house forced the sense of their presence upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 53]: I seemed to see the forsaken things in them staring at each other , hopeless and useless , across the dividing space , as if saying to themselves , ` We belong to the dead , are mouldering to the dust after them , and in the dust alone we meet . '
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 72]: From the vacant rooms my soul seemed to float out beyond , searching still -- to find nothing but loneliness and emptiness betwixt me and the stars ; and beyond the stars more loneliness and more emptiness still -- no rest for the sole of the foot of the wandering Psyche -- save -- one mighty saving -- an exception which , if true , must be the one all-absorbing rule .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 40]: ` But , ' I was saying to myself , ` love unknown is not even equal to love lost , ' when my reverie was broken by the dull noise of a horse 's hoofs upon the sward .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 8]: I rose and went to the window .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 30]: As I crossed the room , my brain rather than myself suddenly recalled the night when my pendulum drew from the churning trees the unwelcome genius of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 31]: The moment I reached the window -- there through the dim Summer twilight , once more from the trees , now as still as sleep , came the same figure .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 12]: Mr Coningham saw me at the fire-lighted window , and halted .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 7]: ` May I be admitted ? '
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 4]: he asked ceremoniously .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 34]: I made a sign to him to ride round to the door , for I could not speak aloud : it would have been rude to the memories that haunted the silent house .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 14]: ` May I come in for a few minutes , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 16]: he asked again , already at the door by the time I had opened it .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 12]: ` By all means , Mr Coningham , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 22]: ` Only you must tie your horse to this ring , for we -- I -- have no stable here . '
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 19]: ` I 've done this before , ' he answered , as he made the animal fast . '
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 10]: I know the ways of the place well enough .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 11]: But surely you 're not here in absolute solitude ? '
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 6]: ` Yes , I am .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 8]: I prefer being alone at present . '
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 8]: ` Very unhealthy , I must say !
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 23]: You will grow hypochondriacal if you mope in this fashion , ' he returned , following me up-stairs to my room . '
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 26]: A day or two of solitude now and then would , I suspect , do most people more good than harm , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 14]: ` But you must not think I intend leading a hermit 's life .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 9]: Have you heard that my aunt -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 5]: ` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 9]: -- You are left alone in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 19]: But relations are not a man 's only friends -- and certainly not always his best friends . '
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 11]: I made no reply , thinking of my uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 13]: I did not know you were down , ' he resumed . '
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 30]: I was calling at my father 's , and seeing your light across the park , thought it possible you might be here , and rode over to see .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 13]: May I take the liberty of asking what your plans are ? '
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 10]: he added , seating himself by the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 22]: I have hardly had time to form new ones ; but I mean to stick to my work , anyhow . '
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 7]: ` You mean your profession ? '
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 13]: ` Yes , if you will allow me to call it such .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 15]: I have had success enough already to justify me in going on . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 14]: I am more pleased than surprised to hear it , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 12]: ` But what will you do with the old nest ? '
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 22]: ` Let the old nest wait for the old bird , Mr Coningham -- keep it to die in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 17]: I do n't like to hear a young fellow talking that way , ' he remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 17]: ` You 've got a long life to live yet -- at least I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 35]: But if you leave the house untenanted till the period to which you allude , it will be quite unfit by that time even for the small service you propose to require of it .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 11]: Why not let it -- for a term of years ?
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 14]: I could find you a tenant , I make no doubt . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 6]: I wo n't let it .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 22]: I shall meet the world all the better if I have a place of my own to take refuge in . '
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 15]: ` Well , I ca n't say but there 's good in that fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 21]: To have any spot of your own , however small -- freehold , I mean -- must be a comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 22]: At the same time , what 's the world for , if you 're to meet it in that half-hearted way ?
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 25]: I do n't mean that every young man -- there are exceptions -- must sow just so many bushels of _ avena fatua _ .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 29]: There are plenty of enjoyments to be got without leading a wild life -- which I should be the last to recommend to any young man of principle .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 9]: Take my advice , and let the place .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 18]: But pray do n't do me the injustice to fancy I came to look after a job .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 11]: I shall be most happy to serve you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 11]: I am exceedingly obliged to you , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 36]: ` If you could let the farm for me for the rest of the lease , of which there are but a few years to run , that would be of great consequence to me .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 46]: Herbert , my uncle 's foreman , who has the management now , is a very good fellow , but I doubt if he will do more than make both ends meet without my aunt , and the accounts would bother me endlessly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 15]: I shall find out whether Lord Inglewold would be inclined to resume the fag-end .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 29]: In such case , as the lease has been a long one , and land has risen much , he would doubtless pay a part of the difference .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 15]: Then there 's the stock , worth a good deal , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 8]: I 'll see what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 11]: And then there 's the stray bit of park ? '
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 9]: ` What do you mean by that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 22]: ` We have been in the way of calling it the _ park _ , though why I never could tell .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 20]: I confess it does look like a bit of Sir Giles 's that had wandered beyond the gates . '
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 16]: ` There _ is _ some old story or other about it , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 18]: The possessors of the Moldwarp estate have , from time immemorial , regarded it as properly theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 6]: I know that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 9]: I am much obliged to them , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 13]: _ I _ have been in the habit of thinking differently . '
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 13]: ` Of course , of course , ' he rejoined , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 11]: ` But there may have been some -- mistake somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 14]: I know Sir Giles would give five times its value for it . '
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 42]: ` He should not have it if he offered the Moldwarp estate in exchange , ' I cried indignantly ; and the thought flashed across me that this temptation was what my uncle had feared from the acquaintance of Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 23]: ` Your sincerity will not be put to so great a test as that , ' he returned , laughing quite merrily .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 14]: ` But I am glad you have such a respect for real property .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 15]: At the same time -- how many acres are there of it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 13]: I do n't know , ' I answered , curtly and truly .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 7]: ` It is of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 22]: Only if you do n't want to be tempted , do n't let Sir Giles or my father broach the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 7]: You need n't look at me .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 10]: _ I _ am not Sir Giles 's agent .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 11]: Neither do my father and I run in double harness .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 39]: He hinted , however , this very day , that he believed the old fool would n't stick at # 500 an acre for this bit of grass -- if he could n't get it for less . '
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 70]: ` If that is what you have come about , Mr Coningham , ' I rejoined , haughtily I dare say , for something I could not well define made me feel as if the dignity of a thousand ancestors were perilled in my own , ' I beg you will not say another word on the subject , for sell this land I _ will not _ . '
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 7]: He was looking at me strangely .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 53]: His eye glittered with what , under other circumstances , I might have taken for satisfaction ; but he turned his face away and rose , saying with a curiously altered tone , as he took up his hat , ` I 'm very sorry to have offended you , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 6]: I sincerely beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 12]: I thought our old -- friendship may I not call it ?
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 13]: -- would have justified me in merely reporting what I had heard .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 8]: I see now that I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 15]: I ought to have shown more regard for your feelings at this trying time .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 25]: But again I assure you I was only reporting , and had not the slightest intention of making myself a go-between in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 23]: One word more : I have no doubt I could _ let _ the field for you -- at good grazing rental .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 11]: That I think you can hardly object to . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 47]: I should be much obliged to you , ' I replied -- ` for a term of not more than seven years -- but without the house , and with the stipulation expressly made that I have right of way in every direction through it . '
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 8]: ` Reasonable enough , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 23]: ` One thing more , ' I said : ` all these affairs must be pure matters of business between us . '
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 29]: ` As you please , ' he returned , with , I fancied , a shadow of disappointment , if not of displeasure , on his countenance . '
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 27]: I should have been more gratified if you had accepted a friendly office ; but I will do my best for you , notwithstanding . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 15]: I had no intention of being unfriendly , Mr Coningham , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 40]: ` But when I think of it , I fear I may have been rude , for the bare proposal of selling this Naboth 's vineyard of mine would go far to make me rude to any man alive .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 16]: It sounds like an invitation to dishonour myself in the eyes of my ancestors . '
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 8]: you do care about your ancestors ? '
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 12]: he said , half musingly , and looking into his hat .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 6]: ` Of course I do .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 7]: Who is there does not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 12]: ` Only some ninety-nine hundredths of the English nation . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 20]: I can not well forget , ' I returned , ` what my ancestors have done for me . '
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 16]: ` Whereas most people only remember that their ancestors can do no more for them .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 10]: I declare I am almost glad I offended you .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 34]: It does one good to hear a young man speak like that in these degenerate days , when a buck would rather be the son of a rich brewer than a decayed gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 24]: I will call again about the end of the week -- that is if you will be here -- and report progress . '
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 57]: His manner , as he took his leave , was at once more friendly and more respectful than it had yet been -- a change which I attributed to his having discovered in me more firmness than he had expected , in regard , if not of my rights , at least of my social position .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 2]: ARRANGEMENTS .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 54]: My custom at this time , and for long after I had finally settled down in the country , was to rise early in the morning -- often , as I used when a child , before sunrise , in order to see the first burst of the sun upon the new-born world .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 37]: I believed then , as I believe still , that , lovely as the sunset is , the sunrise is more full of mystery , poetry , and even , I had almost said , pathos .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 36]: But often ere he was well up I had begun to imagine what the evening would be like , and with what softly mingled , all but imperceptible , gradations it would steal into night .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 33]: Then , when the night came , I would wander about my little field , vainly endeavouring to picture the glory with which the next day 's sun would rise upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 30]: Hence the morning and evening became well known to me ; and yet I shrink from saying it , for each is endless in the variety of its change .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 72]: And the longer I was alone , I became the more enamoured of solitude , with the labour to which , in my case , it was so helpful ; and began , indeed , to be in some danger of losing sight of my relation to ' a world of men , ' for with that world my imagination and my love for Charley were now my sole recognizable links .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 89]: In the fore-part of the day I read and wrote ; and in the after-part found both employment and pleasure in arranging my uncle 's books , amongst which I came upon a good many treasures , whereof I was now able in some measure to appreciate the value -- thinking often , amidst their ancient dust and odours , with something like indignant pity , of the splendid collection , as I was sure it must be , mouldering away in utter neglect at the neighbouring Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 30]: I was on my knees in the midst of a pile which I had drawn from a cupboard under the shelves , when Mrs Herbert showed Mr Coningham in .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 49]: I was annoyed , for my uncle 's room was sacred ; but as I was about to take him to my own , I saw such a look of interest upon his face that it turned me aside , and I asked him to take a seat .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 13]: ` If you do not mind the dust , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 6]: ` Mind the dust ! '
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 9]: he exclaimed , ' -- of old books !
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 6]: I count it almost sacred .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 11]: I am glad you know how to value them . '
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 8]: What right had he to be glad ?
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 8]: How did he know I valued them ?
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 7]: How could I but value them ?
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 31]: I rebuked my offence , however , and after a little talk about them , in which he revealed much more knowledge than I should have expected , it vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 34]: He then informed me of an arrangement he and Lord Inglewold 's factor had been talking over in respect of the farm ; also of an offer he had had for my field .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 19]: I considered both sufficiently advantageous in my circumstances , and the result was that I closed with both .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 18]: A few days after this arrangement I returned to London , intending to remain for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 19]: I had a warm welcome from Charley , but could not help fancying an unacknowledged something dividing us .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 19]: He appeared , notwithstanding , less oppressed , and , in a word , more like other people .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 19]: I proceeded at once to finish two or three papers and stories , which late events had interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 32]: But within a week London had grown to me stifling and unendurable , and I longed unspeakably for the free air of my field and the loneliness of my small castle .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 42]: If my reader regard me as already a hypochondriac , the sole disproof I have to offer is , that I was then diligently writing what some years afterwards obtained a hearty reception from the better class of the reading public .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 32]: Whether my habits were healthy or not , whether my love of solitude was natural or not , I can not but hope from this that my modes of thinking were .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 78]: The end was that , after finishing the work I had on hand , I collected my few belongings , gave up my lodging , bade Charley good-bye , receiving from him a promise to visit me at my own house if possible , and took my farewell of London for a season , determined not to return until I had produced a work which my now more enlarged judgment might consider fit to see the light .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 29]: I had laid out all my spare money upon books , with which , in a few heavy trunks , I now went back to my solitary dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 69]: I had no care upon my mind , for my small fortune , along with the rent of my field , was more than sufficient for my maintenance in the almost anchoretic seclusion in which I intended to live , and hence I had every advantage for the more definite projection and prosecution of a work which had been gradually shaping itself in my mind for months past .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 34]: Before leaving for London , I had already spoken to a handy lad employed upon the farm , and he had kept himself free to enter my service when I should require him .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 25]: He was the more necessary to me that I still had my mare Lilith , from which nothing but fate should ever part me .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 41]: I had no difficulty in arranging with the new tenant for her continued accommodation at the farm ; while , as Herbert still managed its affairs , the services of his wife were available as often as I required them .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 19]: But my man soon made himself capable of doing everything for me , and proved himself perfectly trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 78]: I must find a name for my place -- for its own I will not write : let me call it The Moat : there were signs , plain enough to me after my return from Oxford , that there had once been a moat about it , of which the hollow I have mentioned as the spot where I used to lie and watch for the sun 's first rays , had evidently been a part .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 46]: But the remains of the moat lay at a considerable distance from the house , suggesting a large area of building at some former period , proof of which , however , had entirely vanished , the house bearing every sign of a narrow completeness .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 37]: The work I had undertaken required a constantly recurring reference to books of the sixteenth century ; and although I had provided as many as I thought I should need , I soon found them insufficient .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 51]: My uncle 's library was very large for a man in his position , but it was not by any means equally developed ; and my necessities made me think often of the old library at the Hall , which might contain somewhere in its ruins every book I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 65]: Not only , however , would it have been useless to go searching in the formless mass for this or that volume , but , unable to grant Sir Giles the desire of his heart in respect of my poor field , I did not care to ask of him the comparatively small favour of being allowed to burrow in his dust-heap of literature .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 30]: I was sitting , one hot noon , almost in despair over a certain little point concerning which I could find no definite information , when Mr Coningham called .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 59]: After some business matters had been discussed , I mentioned , merely for the sake of talk , the difficulty I was in -- the sole disadvantage of a residence in the country as compared with London , where the British Museum was the unfailing resort of all who required such aid as I was in want of .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 14]: ` But there is the library at Moldwarp Hall , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 19]: ` Yes , _ there _ it is ; but there is not _ here _ . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 17]: I have no doubt Sir Giles would make you welcome to borrow what books you wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 10]: He is a good-natured man , Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 9]: I explained my reason for not troubling him .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 41]: ` Besides , ' I added , ` the library is in such absolute chaos , that I might with less loss of time run up to London , and find any volume I happened to want among the old-book-shops .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 28]: You have no idea what a mess Sir Giles 's books are in -- scarcely two volumes of the same book to be found even in proximity .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 13]: It is one of the most painful sights I ever saw . '
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 59]: He said little more , but from what followed , I suspect either he or his father spoke to Sir Giles on the subject ; for , one day , as I was walking past the park-gates , which I had seldom entered since my return , I saw him just within , talking to old Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 33]: I saluted him in passing , and he not only returned the salutation in a friendly manner , but made a step towards me as if he wished to speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 6]: I turned and approached him .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 10]: He came out and shook hands with me . '
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 27]: I know who you are , Mr Cumbermede , although I have never had the pleasure of speaking to you before , ' he said frankly .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 46]: ` There you are mistaken , Sir Giles , ' I returned ; ` but you could hardly be expected to remember the little boy who , many years ago , having stolen one of your apples , came to you to comfort him . '
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 5]: He laughed heartily . '
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 10]: I remember the circumstance well , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 8]: ` And you were that unhappy culprit ?
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 13]: To tell the truth , I have thought of it many times .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 10]: It was a remarkably fine thing to do . '
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 8]: steal the apple , Sir Giles ? '
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 9]: ` Make the instant reparation you did . '
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 14]: ` There was no reparation in asking you to box my ears . '
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 11]: ` It was all you could do , though . '
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 10]: ` To ease my own conscience , it was .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 15]: There is always a satisfaction , I suppose , in suffering for your sins .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 17]: But I have thought a thousand times of your kindness in shaking hands with me instead .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 15]: You treated me as the angels treat the repentant sinner , Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 42]: ` Well , I certainly never thought of it in that light , ' he said ; then , as if wishing to change the subject , -- ` Do n't you find it lonely now your uncle is gone ? '
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 11]: I miss him more than I can tell . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 18]: A very worthy man he was -- too good for this world , by all accounts . '
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 18]: ` He 's not the worse off for that now , Sir Giles , I trust . '
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 28]: ` No ; of course not , ' he returned quickly , with the usual shrinking from the slightest allusion to what is called the other world .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 11]: -- ` Is there anything I can do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 10]: You are a literary man , they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 16]: There are a good many books of one sort and another lying at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 10]: Some of them might be of use to you .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 6]: They are at your service .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 41]: I am sure you are to be trusted even with mouldy books , which , from what I hear , must be a greater temptation to you now than red-cheeked apples , ' he added with another merry laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 13]: I will tell you what , ' Sir Giles , I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 15]: ` It has often grieved me to think of the state of your library .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 15]: It would be scarcely possible for me to find a book in it now .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 37]: But if you would trust me , I should be delighted , in my spare hours , of which I can command a good many , to put the whole in order for you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 8]: I should be under the greatest obligation .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 15]: I have always intended having some capable man down from London to arrange it .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 18]: I am no great reader myself , but I have the highest respect for a good library .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 16]: It ought never to have got into the condition in which I found it . '
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 13]: ` The books are fast going to ruin , I fear . '
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 6]: ` Are they indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 8]: he exclaimed , with some consternation . '
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 10]: I was not in the least aware of that .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 19]: I thought so long as I let no one meddle with them , they were safe enough . '
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 22]: ` The law of the moth and rust holds with books as well as other unused things , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 34]: ` Then , pray , my dear sir , undertake the thing at once , ' he said , in a tone to which the uneasiness of self-reproach gave a touch of imperiousness .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 19]: ` But really , ' he added , ` it seems trespassing on your goodness much too far .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 5]: Your time is valuable .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 8]: Would it be a long job ? '
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 22]: ` It would doubtless take some months ; but the pleasure of seeing order dawn from confusion would itself repay me .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 17]: And I _ might _ come upon certain books of which I am greatly in want .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 38]: You will have to allow me a carpenter though , for the shelves are not half sufficient to hold the books ; and I have no doubt those there are stand in need of repair . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 8]: I have a carpenter amongst my people .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 6]: Old houses want constant attention .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 10]: I shall put him under your orders with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 16]: Come and dine with me to-morrow , and we 'll talk it all over . '
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 10]: ` You are very kind , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 9]: ` Is Mr Brotherton at home ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 11]: I am sorry to say he is not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 13]: I heard the other day that he had sold his commission . '
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 7]: ` Yes -- six months ago .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 32]: His regiment was ordered to India , and -- and -- his mother -- But he does not give us much of his company , ' added the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 20]: I am sorry he is not at home , for he would have been glad to meet you . '
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 15]: Instead of responding , I merely made haste to accept Sir Giles 's invitation .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 68]: I confess I did not altogether relish having anything to do with the future property of Geoffrey Brotherton ; but the attraction of the books was great , and in any case I should be under no obligation to him ; neither was the nature of the service I was about to render him such as would awaken any sense of obligation in a mind like his .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 103]: I could not help recalling the sarcastic criticisms of Clara when I entered the drawing-room of Moldwarp Hall -- a long , low-ceiled room , with its walls and stools and chairs covered with tapestry , some of it the work of the needle , other some of the Gobelin loom ; but although I found Lady Brotherton a common enough old lady , who showed little of the dignity of which she evidently thought much , and was more condescending to her yeoman neighbour than was agreeable , I did not at once discover ground for the severity of those remarks .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 50]: Miss Brotherton , the eldest of the family , a long-necked lady , the flower of whose youth was beginning to curl at the edges , I found well-read , but whether in books or the reviews of them , I had to leave an open question as yet .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 23]: Nor was I sufficiently taken with her not to feel considerably dismayed when she proffered me her assistance in arranging the library .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 51]: I made no objection at the time , only hinting that the drawing up of a catalogue afterwards might be a fitter employment for her fair fingers ; but I resolved to create such a fearful pother at the very beginning , that her first visit should be her last .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 16]: And so I doubt not it would have fallen out , but for something else .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 56]: The only other person who dined with us was a Miss Pease -- at least so I will call her -- who , although the law of her existence appeared to be fetching and carrying for Lady Brotherton , was yet , in virtue of a poor-relationship , allowed an uneasy seat at the table .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 6]: Her obedience was mechanically perfect .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 17]: One wondered how the mere nerves of volition could act so instantaneously upon the slightest hint .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 39]: I saw her more than once or twice withdraw her fork when almost at her lips , and , almost before she had laid it down , rise from her seat to obey some half-whispered , half-nodded behest .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 12]: But her look was one of injured meekness and self-humbled submission .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 24]: Sir Giles now and then gave her a kind or merry word , but she would reply to it with almost abject humility .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 27]: Her face was grey and pinched , her eyes were very cold , and she ate as if she did not know one thing from another .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 8]: Over our wine Sir Giles introduced business .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 26]: I professed myself ready , with a housemaid and carpenter at my orders when I should want them , to commence operations the following afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 33]: He begged me to ask for whatever I might want , and after a little friendly chat , I took my leave , elated with the prospect of the work before me .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 23]: About three o'clock the next afternoon I took my way to the Hall , to assume the temporary office of creative librarian .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 2]: PREPARATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 22]: It was a lovely afternoon , the air hot , and the shadows of the trees dark upon the green grass .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 23]: The clear sun was shining sideways on the little oriel window of one of the rooms in which my labour awaited me .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 37]: Never have I seen a picture of more stately repose than the huge pile of building presented , while the curious vane on the central square tower glittered like the outburning flame of its hidden life .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 32]: The only objection I could find to it was that it stood isolated from its own park , although the portion next it was kept as trim as the smoothest lawn .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 24]: There was not a door anywhere to be seen , except the two gateway entrances , and not a window upon the ground-floor .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 47]: All the doors and low windows were either within the courts , or opened on the garden , which , with its terraced walks and avenues and one tiny lawn , surrounded the two further sides of the house , and was itself enclosed by walls .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 27]: I knew the readiest way to the library well enough : once admitted to the outer gate , I had no occasion to trouble the servants .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 58]: The rooms containing the books were amongst the bed-rooms , and after crossing the great hall , I had to turn my back on the stair which led to the ball-room and drawing-room , and ascend another to the left , so that I could come and go with little chance of meeting any of the family .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 25]: The rooms , I have said , were six , none of them of any great size , and all ill-fitted for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 29]: In fact , there was such a sense of confinement about the whole arrangement as gave me the feeling that any difficult book read there would be unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 20]: Order , however , is only another kind of light , and would do much to destroy the impression .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 17]: Having with practical intent surveyed the situation , I saw there was no space for action .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 12]: I must have at least the temporary use of another room .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 52]: Observing that the last of the suite of book-rooms furthest from the armoury had still a door into the room beyond , I proceeded to try it , thinking to know at a glance whether it would suit me , and whether it was likely to be yielded for my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 18]: It opened , and , to my dismay , there stood Clara Coningham , fastening her collar .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 14]: She looked sharply round , and made a half-indignant step towards me . '
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 15]: I beg your pardon a thousand times , Miss Coningham , ' I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 15]: ` Will you allow me to explain , or must I retreat unheard ? '
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 26]: I was vexed indeed , for , notwithstanding a certain flutter at the heart , I had no wish to renew my acquaintance with her .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 14]: ` There must be some fatality about the place , Mr Cumbermede ! '
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 10]: she said , almost with her old merry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 6]: ` It frightens me . '
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 9]: ` Precisely my own feeling , Miss Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 12]: I had no idea you were in the neighbourhood . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 35]: I can not say so much as that , for I had heard you were at The Moat ; but I had no expectation of seeing you -- least of all in this house .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 33]: I suppose you are on the scent of some musty old book or other , ' she added , approaching the door , where I stood with the handle in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 22]: ` My object is an invasion rather than a hunt , ' I said , drawing back that she might enter .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 15]: ` Just as it was the last time you and I were here ! '
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 23]: she went on , with scarcely a pause , and as easily as if there had never been any misunderstanding between us .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 54]: I had thought myself beyond any further influence from her fascinations , but when I looked in her beautiful face , and heard her allude to the past with so much friendliness , and such apparent unconsciousness of any reason for forgetting it , a tremor ran through me from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 9]: I mastered myself sufficiently to reply , however .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 48]: ` It is the last time you will see it so , ' I said ; ` for here stands the Hercules of the stable -- about to restore it to cleanliness , and what is of far more consequence in a library -- to order . '
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 8]: ` You do n't mean it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 6]: she exclaimed with genuine surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 10]: ` I 'm so glad I 'm here ! '
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 10]: ` Are you on a visit , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 15]: ` Indeed I am ; though how it came about I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 7]: I dare say my father does .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 19]: Lady Brotherton has invited me , stiffly of course , to spend a few weeks during their stay .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 20]: Sir Giles must be in it : I believe I am rather a favourite with the good old man .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 29]: But I have another fancy : my grandfather is getting old ; I suspect my father has been making himself useful , and this invitation is an acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 24]: Men always buttress their ill-built dignities by keeping poor women in the dark ; by which means you drive us to infinite conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 24]: That is how we come to be so much cleverer than you at putting two and two together , and making five . '
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 22]: ` But , ' I ventured to remark , ` under such circumstances , you will hardly enjoy your visit . '
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 5]: sha 'n' t I ?
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 11]: I shall get fun enough out of it for that .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 13]: They are -- all but Sir Giles -- they are great fun .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 19]: Of course they do n't treat me as an equal , but I take it out in amusement .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 11]: You will find you have to do the same . '
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 11]: ` Not I. I have nothing to do with them .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 16]: I am here as a skilled workman -- one whose work is his sufficient reward .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 10]: There is nothing degrading in that -- is there ?
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 14]: If I thought there was , of course I should n't come . '
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 12]: ` You _ never _ did anything you felt degrading ? '
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 5]: ` Happy mortal ! '
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 18]: she said , with a sigh -- whether humorous or real , I could not tell . '
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 10]: I have had no occasion , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 17]: ` And yet , as I hear , you have made your mark in literature ? '
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 5]: ` Who says that ?
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 5]: I should not . '
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 24]: ` Never mind , ' she rejoined , with , as I fancied , the look of having said more than she ought .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 21]: ` But , ' she added , ' I wish you would tell me in what periodicals you write . '
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 6]: ` You must excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 14]: I do not wish to be first known in connection with fugitive things .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 19]: When first I publish a book , you may be assured my name will be on the title-page .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 14]: Meantime , I must fulfil the conditions of my _ entrée _ . '
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 13]: ` And I must go and pay my respects to Lady Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 7]: I have only just arrived . '
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 8]: ` Wo n't you find it dull ?
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 12]: There 's nobody of man-kind at home but Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 5]: ` You are unjust .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 13]: If Mr Brotherton had been here , I should n't have come .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 6]: I find him troublesome . '
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 15]: I thought she blushed , notwithstanding the air of freedom with which she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 29]: ` If he should come into the property to-morrow , ' she went on , ' I fear you would have little chance of completing your work . '
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 20]: ` If he came into the property this day six months , I fear he would find it unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 10]: Certainly what was to do should remain undone . '
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 9]: ` Do n't be too sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 6]: He might win you over .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 6]: He can talk . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 12]: I should not be so readily pleased as another might . '
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 21]: She bent towards me , and said in an almost hissing whisper -- ` Wilfrid , I hate him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 3]: I started .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 6]: She looked what she said .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 14]: The blood shot to my heart , and again rushed to my face .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 15]: But suddenly she retreated into her own room , and noiselessly closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 19]: The same moment I heard that of a further room open , and presently Miss Brotherton peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 10]: ` How do you do , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 12]: ` You are already hard at work , I see . '
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 9]: I was , in fact , doing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 17]: I explained that I could not make a commencement without the use of another room . '
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 21]: I will send the housekeeper , and you can arrange with her , ' she said , and left me .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 8]: In a few minutes Mrs Wilson entered .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 10]: Her manner was more stiff and formal than ever .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 9]: We shook hands in a rather limp fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 27]: ` You 've got your will at last , Mr Cumbermede , ' she said , ' I suppose the thing 's to be done ! '
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 13]: ` It is , Mrs Wilson , I am happy to say .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 32]: Sir Giles kindly offered me the use of the library , and I took the liberty of representing to him that there was no library until the books were arranged . '
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 20]: ` Why could n't you take a book away with you and read it in comfort at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 16]: ` How could I take the book home if I could n't find it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 16]: ` You could find something worth reading , if that were all you wanted . '
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 7]: ` But that is not all .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 7]: I have plenty of reading . '
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 14]: ` Then I do n't see what 's the good of it . '
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 11]: ` Books are very much like people , Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 23]: There are not so many you want to know all about ; but most could tell you things you do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 14]: I want certain books in order to question them about certain things . '
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 20]: ` Well , all I know is , it 'll be more trouble than it 's worth . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 34]: I am afraid it will -- to you , Mrs Wilson ; but though I am taking a thousand times your trouble , I expect to be well repaid for it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 7]: I have no doubt of that .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 8]: Sir Giles is a liberal gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 18]: ` You do n't suppose _ he _ is going to pay me , Mrs Wilson ? '
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 6]: ` Who else should ? '
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 11]: ` Why , the books themselves , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 15]: Evidently she thought I was making game of her , for she was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 12]: ` Will you show me which room I can have ? '
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 11]: ` It must be as near this one as possible .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 7]: Is the next particularly wanted ? '
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 14]: I asked , pointing to the door which led into Clara 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 47]: She went to it quickly , and opened it far enough to put her hand in and take the key from the other side , which she then inserted on my side , turned in the lock , drew out , and put in her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 11]: ` That room is otherwise engaged , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 12]: ` You must be content with one across the corridor . '
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 10]: ` Very well -- if it is not far .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 20]: I should make slow work of it , if I had to carry the books a long way . '
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 19]: ` You can have one of the footmen to help you , ' she said , apparently relenting .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 11]: ` No , thank you , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 13]: I will have no one touch the books but myself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 21]: I will show you one which I think will suit your purpose , ' she said , leading the way .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 11]: It was nearly opposite -- a bed-room , sparely furnished .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 19]: This will do -- if you will order all the things to be piled in that corner . '
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 31]: She stood silent for a few moments , evidently annoyed , then turned and left the room , saying , ' I will see to it , Mr Cumbermede . '
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 55]: Returning to the books and pulling off my coat , I had soon compelled such a cloud of very ancient and smothering dust , that when Miss Brotherton again made her appearance , her figure showed dim through the thick air , as she stood -- dismayed , I hoped -- in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 28]: I pretended to be unaware of her presence , and went on beating and blowing , causing yet thicker volumes of solid vapour to clothe my presence .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 9]: She withdrew without even an attempt at parley .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 40]: Having heaped several great piles near the door , each composed of books of nearly the same size , the first rudimentary approach to arrangement , I crossed to the other room to see what progress had been made .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 13]: To my surprise and annoyance , I found nothing had been done .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 46]: Determined not to have my work impeded by the remissness of the servants , and seeing I must place myself at once on a proper footing in the house , I went to the drawing-room to ascertain , if possible , where Sir Giles was .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 30]: I had of course put on my coat , but having no means of ablution at hand , I must have presented a very unpresentable appearance when I entered .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 53]: Lady Brotherton half rose , in evident surprise at my intrusion , but at once resumed her seat , saying , as she turned her chair half towards the window where the other two ladies sat , ` The housekeeper will attend to you , Mr Cumbermede -- or the butler . '
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 16]: I could see that Clara was making some inward merriment over my appearance and reception .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 26]: ` Could you tell me , Lady Brotherton , ' I said , ` where I should be likely to find Sir Giles ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 19]: I can give you no information on that point , ' she answered , with consummate stiffness . '
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 13]: I know where he is , ' said Clara , rising . '
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 7]: I will take you to him .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 7]: He is in the study . '
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 17]: She took no heed of the glance broadly thrown at her , but approached the door .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 12]: I opened it , and followed her out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 13]: As soon as we were beyond hearing , she burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 14]: ` How dared you show your workman 's face in that drawing-room ? '
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 4]: she said . '
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 12]: I am afraid you have much offended her ladyship . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 9]: I hope it is for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 17]: When I am properly attended to , I shall have no occasion to trouble her . '
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 9]: She led me to Sir Giles 's study .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 14]: Except newspapers and reports of companies , there was in it nothing printed .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 11]: He rose when we entered , and came towards us .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 11]: ` Looking like your work already , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 9]: he said , holding out his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 17]: I must not shake hands with you this time , Sir Giles , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 9]: ` But I am compelled to trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 10]: I ca n't get on for want of attendance .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 10]: I _ must _ have a little help . '
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 7]: I told him how things were .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 13]: His rosy face grew rosier , and he rang the bell angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 5]: The butler answered it .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 6]: ` Send Mrs Wilson here .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 17]: And I beg , Hurst , you will see that Mr Cumbermede has every attention . '
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 17]: Mrs Wilson presently made her appearance , and stood with a flushed face before her master .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 18]: ` Let Mr Cumbermede 's orders be attended to _ at once _ , Mrs Wilson . '
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 14]: ` Yes , Sir Giles , ' she answered , and waited . '
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 19]: I am greatly obliged to you for letting me know , ' he added , turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 8]: ` Pray insist upon proper attention . '
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 6]: I shall not scruple . '
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 8]: ` That will do , Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 23]: You must not let Mr Cumbermede be hampered in his kind labours for my benefit by the idleness of my servants . '
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 22]: The housekeeper left the room , and after a little chat with Sir Giles , I went back to the books .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 19]: Clara had followed Mrs Wilson , partly , I suspect , for the sake of enjoying her confusion .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 2]: ASSISTANCE .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 38]: I returned to my solitary house as soon as the evening began to grow too dark for my work , which , from the lowness of the windows and the age of the glass , was early .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 13]: All the way as I went , I was thinking of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 38]: Not only had time somewhat obliterated the last impression she had made upon me , but I had , partly from the infection of Charley 's manner , long ago stumbled upon various excuses for her conduct .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 17]: Now I said to myself that she had certainly a look of greater sedateness than before .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 94]: But her expression of dislike to Geoffrey Brotherton had more effect upon me than anything else , inasmuch as there Vanity found room for both the soles of her absurdly small feet ; and that evening , when I went wandering , after my custom , with a volume of Dante in my hand , the book remained unopened , and from the form of Clara flowed influences mingling with and gathering fresh power from those of Nature , whose feminine front now brooded over me half-withdrawn in the dim , starry night .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 7]: I remember that night so well !
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 13]: I can recall it now with a calmness equal to its own .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 58]: Indeed in my memory it seems to belong to my mind as much as to the outer world ; or rather the night filled both , forming the space in which my thoughts moved , as well as the space in which the brilliant thread of the sun-lighted crescent hung clasping the earth-lighted bulk of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 39]: I wandered in the grass until midnight was long by , feeling as quietly and peacefully at home as if my head had been on the pillow and my soul out in a lovely dream of cool delight .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 11]: We lose much even by the good habits we form .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 12]: What tender and glorious changes pass over our sleeping heads unseen !
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 23]: What moons rise and set in rippled seas of cloud , or behind hills of stormy vapour , while we are blind !
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 32]: What storms roll thundering across the airy vault , with no eyes for their keen lightnings to dazzle , while we dream of the dead who will not speak to us !
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 3]: But ah !
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 17]: I little thought to what a dungeon of gloom this lovely night was the jasmine-grown porch !
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 23]: The next morning I was glad to think that there was no wolf at my door , howling _ work -- work !
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 45]: _ Moldwarp Hall drew me with redoubled attraction ; and instead of waiting for the afternoon , which alone I had intended to occupy with my new undertaking , I set out to cross the park the moment I had finished my late breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 40]: Nor could I conceal from myself that it was quite as much for the chance of seeing Clara now and then as from pleasure in the prospect of an ordered library that I repaired thus early to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 44]: In the morning light , however , I began to suspect , as I walked , that , although Clara 's frankness was flattering , it was rather a sign that she was heart-whole towards me than that she was careless of Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 61]: I began to doubt also whether , after our first meeting , which she had carried off so well -- cool even to kindness -- she would care to remember that I was in the house , or derive from it any satisfaction beyond what came of the increased chances of studying the Brothertons from a humorous point of view .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 10]: Then , after all , why was she there ?
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 18]: -- and apparently on such familiar terms with a family socially so far superior to her own ?
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 14]: The result of my cogitations was the resolution to take care of myself .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 13]: But it had vanished utterly before the day was two hours older .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 30]: A youth 's wise talk to himself will not make him a wise man , any more than the experience of the father will serve the son 's need .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 42]: I was hard at work in my shirt-sleeves , carrying an armful of books across the corridor , and thinking whether I had not better bring my servant with me in the afternoon , when Clara came out of her room .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 7]: ` Here already , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 14]: ` Why do n't you have some of the servants to help you ?
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 14]: You 're doing what any one might as well do for you . '
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 38]: ` If these were handsomely bound , ' I answered , ' I should not so much mind ; but being old and tattered , no one ought to touch them who does not love them . '
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 30]: ` Then , I suppose , you would n't trust me with them either , for I can not pretend to anything beyond a second-hand respect for them . '
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 11]: ` What do you mean by a second-hand respect ? '
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 17]: I mean such respect as comes from seeing that a scholar like you respects them . '
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 28]: ` Then I think I could accord you a second-hand sort of trust -- under my own eye , that is , ' I answered , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 14]: ` But you can scarcely leave your hostess to help me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 9]: I will ask Miss Brotherton to come too .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 11]: She will pretend all the respect you desire . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 16]: I made three times the necessary dust in order to frighten her away yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 5]: that 's a pity .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 27]: But I shall manage to overrule her objections -- that is , if you would really like two tolerably educated housemaids to help you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 18]: I will gladly endure one of them for the sake of the other , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 15]: ` No compliments , please , ' she returned , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 13]: In about half an hour she re-appeared , accompanied by Miss Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 21]: They were in white wrappers , with their dresses shortened a little , and their hair tucked under mob caps .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 21]: Miss Brotherton looked like a lady 's - maid , Clara like a lady acting a lady 's - maid .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 51]: I assumed the command at once , pointing out to what heaps in the other room those I had grouped in this were to be added , and giving strict injunctions as to carrying only a few at once , and laying them down with care in regularly ordered piles .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 20]: Clara obeyed with a mock submission , Miss Brotherton with a reserve which heightened the impression of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 72]: I was instinctively careful how I spoke to Clara , fearing to compromise her , but she seemed all at once to change her _ rôle _ , and began to propose , object , and even insist upon her own way , drawing from me the threat of immediate dismission from my service , at which her companion laughed with an awkwardness showing she regarded the pleasantry as a presumption .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 11]: Before one o'clock , the first room was almost empty .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 23]: Then the great bell rang , and Clara , coming from the auxiliary chamber , put her head in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 9]: ` Wo n't you come to luncheon ? '
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 41]: she said , with a sly archness , looking none the less bewitching for a smudge or two on her lovely face , or the blackness of the delicate hands which she held up like two paws for my admiration .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 7]: ` In the servants ' hall ?
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 10]: Workmen do n't sit down with ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 10]: Did Miss Brotherton send you to ask me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 12]: ` Then you had better come and lunch with me . '
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 6]: She shrugged her shoulders . '
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 16]: I hope you will _ some _ day honour my little fragment of a house .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 12]: It is a curious old place , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 12]: I do n't like musty old places , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 27]: ` But I have heard you speak with no little admiration of the Hall : some parts of it are older than my sentry-box . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 21]: I ca n't say I admire it at all as a place to live in , ' she answered curtly .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 19]: ` But I was not asking you to live in mine , ' I said -- foolishly arguing .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 50]: She looked annoyed , whether with herself or me I could not tell , but instantly answered , ` Some day -- when I can without -- But I must go and make myself tidy , or Miss Brotherton will be fancying I have been talking to you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 11]: ` And what have you been doing , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 10]: ` Only asking you to come to lunch . '
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 8]: ` Will you tell her that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 9]: ` Yes -- if she says anything . '
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 17]: ` Then you _ had _ better make haste , and be asked no questions . '
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 4]: She glided away .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 11]: I threw on my coat , and re-crossed the park .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 40]: But I was so eager to see again the fair face in the mob cap , that , although not at all certain of its reappearance , I told my man to go at once and bring the mare .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 19]: He made haste , and by the time I had finished my dinner she was at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 40]: I gave her the rein , and two or three minutes brought me back to the Hall , where , having stabled her , I was at my post again , I believe , before they had finished luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 45]: I had a great heap of books ready in the second room to carry into the first , and had almost concluded they would not come , when I heard their voices -- and presently they entered , but not in their mob caps .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 9]: ` What an unmerciful master you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 9]: said Clara , looking at the heap . '
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 11]: I thought you had gone home to lunch . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 11]: I went home to dinner , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 12]: I get more out of the day by dining early . '
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 9]: ` How is that , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 17]: asked Miss Brotherton , with a nearer approach to cordiality than she had yet shown . '
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 21]: I think the evening the best part of the day -- too good to spend in eating and drinking . '
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 21]: ` But , ' said Clara , quite gravely , ` are not those the chief ends of existence ? '
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 13]: ` Your friend is satirical , Miss Brotherton , ' I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 25]: ` At least , you are not of her opinion , to judge by the time you have taken , ' she returned . '
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 12]: I have been back nearly an hour , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 11]: ` Workmen do n't take long over their meals . '
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 19]: ` Well , I suppose you do n't want any more of us now , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 21]: ` You will arrange the books you bring from the next room upon these empty shelves , I presume ? '
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 6]: ` No , not yet .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 29]: I must not begin that until I have cleared the very last , got it thoroughly cleaned , the shelves seen to , and others put up . '
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 13]: ` What a tremendous labour you have undertaken , Mr Cumbermede ! '
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 5]: said Miss Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 13]: I am quite ashamed you should do so much for us . '
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 19]: ` I , on the contrary , am delighted to be of any service to Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 19]: ` But you do n't expect us to slave all day as we did in the morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 7]: ` Certainly not , Miss Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 9]: I am too grateful to be exacting . '
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: ` Thank you for that pretty speech .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 13]: Come , then , Miss Brotherton , we must have a walk .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 8]: We have n't been out-of-doors to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 24]: ` Really , Miss Coningham , I think the least we can do is to help Mr Cumbermede to our small ability . '
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 4]: ` Nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 11]: -- -LRB- Miss Brotherton positively started at the word . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 21]: ` Any two of the maids or men would serve his purpose better , if he did not affect fastidiousness .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 16]: We sha 'n' t be allowed to come to-morrow if we overdo it to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 24]: Miss Brotherton was evidently on the point of saying something indignant , but yielded notwithstanding , and I was left alone once more .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 13]: Again I laboured until the shadows grew thick around the gloomy walls .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 44]: As I galloped home , I caught sight of my late companions coming across the park ; and I trust I shall not be hardly judged if I confess that I did sit straighter in my saddle , and mind my seat better .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 14]: Thus ended my second day 's work at the library of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 3]: AN EXPOSTULATION .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 11]: Neither of the ladies came to me the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 30]: As far as my work was concerned , I was in considerably less need of their assistance , for it lay only between two rooms opening into each other .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 33]: Nor did I feel any great disappointment , for so long as a man has something to do , expectation is pleasure enough , and will continue such for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 13]: It is those who are unemployed to whom expectation becomes an agony .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 22]: I went home to my solitary dinner almost resolved to return to my original plan of going only in the afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 39]: I was not thoroughly in love with Clara ; but it was certainly the hope of seeing her , and not the pleasure of handling the dusty books , that drew me back to the library that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 13]: I had got rather tired of the whole affair in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 34]: It was very hot , and the dust was choking , and of the volumes I opened as they passed through my hands , not one was of the slightest interest to me .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 16]: But for the chance of seeing Clara I should have lain in the grass instead .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 4]: No one came .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 13]: I grew weary , and for a change retreated into the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 54]: Evidently , not the slightest heed was paid to the weapons now , and I was thinking with myself that , when I had got the books in order , I might give a few days to furbishing and oiling them , when the door from the gallery opened , and Clara entered .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 4]: a truant ? '
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 12]: ` You take accusation at least by the forelock , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 16]: Who is the real truant now -- if I may suggest a mistake ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 7]: _ I _ never undertook anything .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 16]: How many guesses have you made as to the cause of your desertion to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 8]: ` Well , three or four . '
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 19]: ` Have you made one as to the cause of Miss Brotherton 's graciousness to you yesterday ? '
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 10]: ` At least I remarked the change . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 5]: I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 24]: There was a short notice of some of your writings in a certain magazine which I contrived should fall in her way . '
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 4]: ` Impossible ! '
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 4]: I exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 10]: I have never put my name to anything . '
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 14]: ` But you have put the same name to all your contributions . '
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 11]: ` How should the reviewer know it meant me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 9]: ` Your own name was never mentioned . '
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 12]: I thought she looked a little confused as she said this .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 12]: ` Then how should Miss Brotherton know it meant me ? '
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 14]: She hesitated a moment -- then answered : ` Perhaps from internal evidence .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 11]: -- I suppose I must confess I told her . '
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 10]: ` Then how did _ you _ know ? '
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 13]: I have been one of your readers for a long time . '
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 12]: ` But how did you come to know my work ? '
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 7]: ` That has oozed out . '
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 12]: ` Some one must have told you , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 24]: ` That is my secret , ' she replied , with the air of making it a mystery in order to tease me .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 12]: ` It must be all a mistake , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 7]: ` Show me the magazine . '
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 16]: ` As you wo n't take my word for it , I wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 9]: ` Well , I shall soon find out .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 9]: There is but one could have done it .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 17]: It is very kind of him , no doubt ; but I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 14]: That kind of thing should come of itself -- not through friends . '
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 10]: ` Who do you fancy has done it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 29]: ` If you have a secret , so have I. ' My answer seemed to relieve her , though I could not tell what gave me the impression .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 18]: ` You are welcome to yours , and I will keep mine , ' she said . '
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 13]: I only wanted to explain Miss Brotherton 's condescension yesterday . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 15]: I thought you were going to explain why you did n't come to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 7]: ` That is only a re-action .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 13]: I have no doubt she thinks she went too far yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 5]: ` That is absurd .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 9]: She was civil ; that was all . '
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 18]: ` In reading your thermometer , you must know its zero first , ' she replied sententiously .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 11]: ` Is the sword you call yours there still ? '
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 11]: ` Yes , and I call it mine still . '
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you take it , then ?
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 10]: I should have carried it off long ago . '
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 16]: ` To steal my own would be to prejudice my right , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 14]: ` But I have often thought of telling Sir Giles about it . '
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 4]: I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 15]: My head has been full of other things , and any time will do .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 15]: But I should like to see it in its own place once more . '
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 15]: I had taken it from the wall , and now handed it to her .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 6]: ` Is this it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 4]: she said carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 16]: ` It is -- just as it was carried off my bed that night . '
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 8]: ` What room were you in ? '
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 12]: she asked , trying to draw it from the sheath . '
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 5]: I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 9]: I 've never been in it since . '
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 27]: ` You do n't seem to me to have the curiosity natural to a -- ' ` To a woman -- no , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 18]: ` To a man of spirit , ' she retorted , with an appearance of indignation . '
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 16]: I do n't believe you can tell even how it came into your possession ! '
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 15]: ` Why should n't it have been in the family from time immemorial ? '
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 3]: ` So !
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 21]: -- And you do n't care either to recover it , or to find out how you lost it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 5]: ` How can I ?
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 6]: Where is Mr Close ? '
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 11]: ` Why , dead , years and years ago . '
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 5]: ` So I understood .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 20]: I ca n't well apply to him , then , and I am certain no one else knows . '
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 9]: ` Do n't be too sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 18]: Perhaps Sir Giles -- ' ' I am positive Sir Giles knows nothing about it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 16]: I have reason to think the story is not altogether unknown in the family . '
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 9]: ` Have you told it , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 14]: ` No , but I _ have _ heard it alluded to . '
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 6]: ` By Sir Giles ? '
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 8]: ` By whom , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 8]: I will answer no more questions . '
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 7]: ` Geoffrey , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 6]: ` You are not polite .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 14]: Do you suppose I am bound to tell you all I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 6]: ` Not by any means .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 17]: Only , you ought n't to pique a curiosity you do n't mean to satisfy . '
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 12]: ` But if I 'm not at liberty to say more ?
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 24]: -- All I meant to say was that , if I were you , I _ would _ get back that sword . '
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 33]: ` You hint at a secret , and yet suppose I could carry off its object as I might a rusty nail , which any passer-by would be made welcome to ! '
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 17]: ` You might take it first , and mention the thing to Sir Giles afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 8]: ` Why not mention it first ? '
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 15]: ` Only on the supposition you had not the courage to claim it . '
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 17]: ` In that case I certainly should n't have the courage to avow the deed afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 9]: I do n't understand you , Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 11]: ` That is always your way , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 7]: ` You take everything so seriously !
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 15]: Why could n't I make a proposition without being supposed to mean it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 18]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Glued , '' she echoed , `` What do you mean ? '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 5]: I was not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 32]: There was something short of uprightness in the whole tone of her attempted persuasion -- which indeed I could hardly believe to have been so lightly intended as she now suggested .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 18]: The effect of my feeling for her was that of a slight frost on the Spring blossoms .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 28]: She had been examining the hilt with a look of interest , and was now for the third time trying to draw the blade from the sheath .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 12]: ` It 's no use , Clara , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 13]: ` It has been too many years glued to the scabbard . '
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 4]: ` Glued ! '
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 3]: she echoed .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 5]: I did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 24]: An expression almost of horror shadowed her face , and at the same moment , to my astonishment , she drew it half-way .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 3]: ` Why !
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 4]: You enchantress ! '
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 4]: I exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 9]: I never saw so much of it before .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 19]: It is wonderfully bright -- when one thinks of the years it has been shut in darkness . '
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 32]: She handed it to me as it was , saying , ` If that weapon was mine , I should never rest until I had found out everything concerning it . '
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 13]: ` That is easily said , Clara ; but how can I ?
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 7]: My uncle knew nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 25]: My grandmother did , no doubt , but almost all I can remember her saying was something about my great-grandfather and Sir Marmaduke . '
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 18]: As I spoke , I tried to draw it entirely , but it would yield no further .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 13]: I then sought to replace it , but it would not move .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 16]: That it yielded to Clara 's touch gave it a fresh interest and value . '
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 12]: I was sure it had a history , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 7]: ` Have you no family papers ?
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 24]: Your house you say is nearly as old as this : are there no papers of _ any _ kind in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 23]: ` Yes , a few , ' I answered -- ` the lease of the farm -- and -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 3]: rubbish ! '
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 9]: ` Is n't the house your own ? '
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 11]: ` And have you ever thoroughly searched it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 8]: I have n't had time yet . '
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 6]: ` Not had time ! '
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 19]: she repeated , in a tone of something so like the uttermost contempt that I was bewildered . '
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 19]: I mean some day or other to have a rummage in the old lumber-room , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 23]: ` Well , I do think that is the least you can do -- if only out of respect to your ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 18]: Depend on it , they do n't like to be forgotten any more than other people . '
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 17]: The intention I had just announced was , however , but just born of her words .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 30]: I had never yet searched even my grandmother 's bureau , and had but this very moment fancied there might be papers in some old chest in the lumber-room .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 26]: That room had already begun to occupy my thoughts from another point of view , and hence , in part , no doubt the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 10]: I was anxious to have a visit from Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 11]: He might bring with him some of our London friends .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 13]: There was absolutely no common room in the house except the hall-kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 17]: The room we had always called the lumber-room was over it , and nearly as large .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 20]: It had a tall stone chimney-piece , elaborately carved , and clearly had once been a room for entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 37]: The idea of restoring it to its original dignity arose in my mind ; and I hoped that , furnished after as antique a fashion as I could compass , it would prove a fine room .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 31]: The windows were small , to be sure , and the pitch rather low , but the whitewashed walls were pannelled , and I had some hopes of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 25]: ` Who knows , ' I said to myself , as I walked home that evening , ` but I may come upon papers ?
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 16]: I do remember something in the furthest corner that looks like a great chest . '
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 28]: Little more had passed between us , but Clara left me with the old Dissatisfaction beginning to turn itself , as if about to awake once more .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 26]: For the present I hung the half-naked blade upon the wall , for I dared not force it lest the scabbard should go to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 30]: When I reached home , I found a letter from Charley , to the effect that , if convenient , he would pay me a visit the following week .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 15]: His mother and sister , he said , had been invited to Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 10]: His father was on the continent for his health .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 38]: Without having consulted them on the matter , which might involve them in after-difficulty , he would come to me , and so have an opportunity of seeing them in the sunshine of his father 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 13]: I wrote at once that I should be delighted to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 39]: The next morning I spent with my man in the lumber-room ; and before mid-day the rest of the house looked like an old curiosity shop -- it was so littered with odds and ends of dust-bloomed antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 21]: It was hard work , and in the afternoon I found myself disinclined for more exercise of a similar sort .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 12]: I had Lilith out , and took a leisurely ride instead .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 14]: The next day , and the next also , I remained at home .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 10]: The following morning I went again to Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 30]: I had not been busy more than an hour or so when Clara , who , I presume , had in passing heard me at work , looked in .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 8]: ` Who is a truant now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 8]: ` Are n't you ashamed of yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 28]: Here has Miss Brotherton been almost curious concerning your absence , and Sir Giles more than once on the point of sending to inquire after you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 9]: ` Why did n't he , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 25]: I suppose he was afraid it might look like an assertion of -- of -- of baronial rights , or something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 13]: How _ could _ you behave in such an inconsiderate fashion ! '
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 16]: ` You must allow me to have _ some _ business of my own . '
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 3]: ` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 20]: But with so many anxious friends , you ought to have given a hint of your intentions . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 7]: I had none , however . '
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 4]: ` Of which ?
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 5]: Friends or intentions ? '
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 4]: ` Either . '
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 3]: No friends ?
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 30]: I verily surprised Miss Pease in the act of studying her `` Cookery for Invalids '' -- in the hope of finding a patient in you , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 15]: She wanted to come and nurse you , but dare n't propose it . '
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 9]: ` It was very kind of her . '
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 4]: ` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 24]: But then you see she 's ready to commit suicide any day , poor old thing , but for lack of courage ! '
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 9]: ` It must be dreary for her ! '
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 3]: ` Dreary !
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 8]: I should poison the old dragon . '
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 54]: ` Well , perhaps I had better tell you , for Miss Pease 's sake , who is evidently the only one that cares a straw about _ me _ in the matter , that possibly I shall be absent a good many days this week , and perhaps the next too . '
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 14]: ` Why , then -- if I may ask -- Mr Absolute ? '
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 14]: ` Because a friend of mine is going to pay me a visit .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 9]: You remember Charley Osborne , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 5]: Of course you do .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 10]: You remember the ice-cave , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 13]: ` Yes , I do -- quite well , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 10]: I fancied I saw a shadow cross her face .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 8]: ` When do you expect him ? '
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 14]: she asked , turning away , and picking a book from the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 10]: ` In a week or so , I think .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 15]: He tells me his mother and sister are coming here on a visit . '
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 12]: ` Yes -- so I believe -- to-morrow , I think .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 9]: I wonder if I ought to be going .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 7]: I do n't think I will .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 38]: I came to please them -- at all events not to please myself ; but as I find it pleasanter than I expected , I wo n't go without a hint and a half at least . '
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 5]: ` Why should you ?
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 7]: There is plenty of room . '
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 9]: ` Yes ; but do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 17]: -- so many inferiors in the house at once might be too much for Madame Dignity .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 10]: She finds one quite enough , I suspect . '
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 14]: ` You do not mean that she regards the Osbornes as inferiors ? '
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 7]: ` Not a doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 7]: I can take care of myself .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 9]: Have you any work for me to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 14]: ` Plenty , if you are in a mood for it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 8]: I will fetch Miss Brotherton . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 9]: I can do without _ her _ . '
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 10]: She went , however , and did not return .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 40]: As I walked home to dinner , she and Miss Brotherton passed me in the carriage , on their way , as I learned afterwards , to fetch the Osborne ladies from the rectory , some ten miles off .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 23]: I did not return to Moldwarp Hall , but helped Styles in the lumber-room , which before night we had almost emptied .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 23]: The next morning I was favoured with a little desultory assistance from the two ladies , but saw nothing of the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 65]: In the afternoon , and both the following days , I took my servant with me , who got through more work than the two together , and we advanced it so far that I was able to leave the room next the armoury in the hands of the carpenter and the housemaid , with sufficient directions , and did not return that week .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 5]: A TALK WITH CHARLEY .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 25]: The following Monday , in the evening , Charley arrived , in great spirits , more excited indeed than I liked to see him .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 35]: There was a restlessness in his eye which made me especially anxious , for it raised a doubt whether the appearance of good spirits was not the result merely of resistance to some anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 22]: But I hoped my companionship , with the air and exercise of the country , would help to quiet him again .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 16]: In the late twilight we took a walk together up and down my field . '
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 14]: I suppose you let your mother know you were coming , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 8]: I did not , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 21]: ` My father must have nothing to lay to their charge in case he should hear of our meeting . '
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 15]: ` But he has not forbidden you to go home , has he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 5]: ` No , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 18]: But he as good as told me I was not to go home while he was away .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 17]: He does not wish me to be there without his presence to counteract my evil influences .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 10]: He seems to regard my mere proximity as dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 16]: I sometimes wonder whether the severity of his religion may not have affected his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 15]: Almost all madness , you know , turns either upon love or religion . '
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 6]: ` So I have heard .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 7]: I doubt it -- with men .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 6]: It may be with women .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 8]: -- But you wo n't surprise them ?
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 8]: It might startle your mother too much .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 8]: She is not strong , you say .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 8]: Had n't I better tell Clara Coningham ?
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 10]: She can let them know you are here . '
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 7]: ` It would be better . '
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 12]: ` What do you say to going there with me to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 13]: I will send my man with a note in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 23]: He looked a little puzzled and undetermined , but said at length , ' I dare say your plan is the best .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 9]: How long has Miss Coningham been here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 9]: ` About ten days , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 9]: He looked thoughtful and made no answer . '
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 20]: I see , you are afraid of my falling in love with her again , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 21]: I confess I like her much better than I did , but I am not quite sure about her yet .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 19]: She is very bewitching anyhow , and a little more might make me lose my heart to her .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 21]: The evident dislike she has to Brotherton would of itself recommend her to any friend of yours or mine . '
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 6]: He turned his face away .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 13]: ` Do not be anxious about me , ' I went on .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 32]: ` The first shadowy conviction of any untruthfulness in her , if not sufficient to change my feelings at once , would at once initiate a backward movement in them . '
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 12]: He kept his face turned away , and I was perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 44]: After a few moments of silence , he turned it towards me again , as if relieved by some resolution suddenly formed , and said with a smile under a still clouded brow , ` Well , old fellow , we 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 10]: It 'll all come right , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 11]: Write your note early , and we 'll follow it .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 23]: How glad I _ shall _ be to have a glimpse of that blessed mother of mine without her attendant dragon ! '
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 13]: ` For God 's sake do n't talk of your father so !
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 12]: Surely , after all , he is a good man ! '
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 12]: ` Then I want a new reading of the word . '
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 10]: ` He loves God , at least . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 50]: I wo n't stop to inquire -- ' said Charley , plunging at once into argument -- ` what influence for good it might or might not have to love a non-existence : I will only ask -- Is it a good God he loves or a bad one ?
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 15]: If the latter , he can hardly be called good for loving him . '
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 18]: ` But if there be a God at all , he must be a good God . '
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 23]: ` Suppose the true God to be the good God , it does not follow that my father worships _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 11]: There is such a thing as worshipping a false God .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 7]: At least the Bible recognizes it .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 33]: For my part , I find myself compelled to say -- either that the true God is not a good God , or that my father does not worship the true God .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 84]: If you say he worships the God of the Bible , I either admit or dispute the assertion , but set it aside as altering nothing ; for if I admit it , the argument lies thus : my father worships a bad God ; my father worships the God of the Bible : therefore the God of the Bible is a bad God ; and if I admit the authority of the Bible , then the true God is a bad God .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 58]: If , however , I dispute the assertion that he worships the God of the Bible , I am left to show , if I can , that the God of the Bible is a good God , and , if I admit the authority of the Bible , to worship another than my father 's God .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 44]: If I do not admit the authority of the Bible , there may , for all that , be a good God , or , which is next best to a perfectly good God , there may be no God at all . '
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 38]: ` Put like a lawyer , Charley : and yet I would venture to join issue with your first assertion -- on which the whole argument is founded -- that your father worships a bad God . '
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 12]: ` Assuredly what he asserts concerning his God is bad . '
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 18]: ` Admitted ; but does he assert _ only _ bad things of his God ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 6]: I dare n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 5]: But God is one .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 19]: You will hardly dare the proposition that an infinite being may be partly good and partly bad . '
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 35]: I heartily hold that God must be _ one _ -- a proposition far more essential than that there is one God -- so far , at least , as my understanding can judge .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 15]: It is only in the limited human nature that good and evil can co-exist .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 27]: But there is just the point : we are not speaking of the absolute God , but of the idea of a man concerning that God .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 32]: You could suppose yourself utterly convinced of a good God long before your ideas of goodness were so correct as to render you incapable of attributing anything wrong to that God .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 47]: Supposing such to be the case , and that you came afterwards to find that you had been thinking something wrong about him , do you think you would therefore grant that you had been believing either in a wicked or in a false God ? '
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 5]: ` Certainly not . '
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 11]: ` Then you must give your father the same scope .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 47]: He attributes what we are absolutely certain are bad things to his God -- and yet he may believe in a good God , for the good in his idea of God is that alone in virtue of which he is able to believe in him .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 9]: No mortal can believe in the bad . '
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 13]: ` He puts the evil foremost in his creed and exhortations . '
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 5]: ` That may be .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 8]: Few people know their own deeper minds .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 20]: The more potent a power in us , I suspect it is the more hidden from our scrutiny . '
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 24]: ` If there be a God , then , Wilfrid , he is very indifferent to what his creatures think of him . '
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 12]: ` Perhaps very patient and hopeful , Charley -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 21]: Perhaps he will not force himself upon them , but help them to grow into the true knowledge of him .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 19]: Your father may worship the true God , and yet have only a little of that knowledge . '
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 4]: A silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 14]: At length -- ` Thank you for my father , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 9]: ` Thank my uncle , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 8]: ` For not being like my father ?
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 8]: -- I do , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 13]: It was the loveliest evening that brooded round us as we walked .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 21]: The moon had emerged from a rippled sea of grey cloud , over which she cast her dull opaline halo .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 36]: Great masses and banks of cloud lay about the rest of the heavens , and , in the dark rifts between , a star or two were visible , gazing from the awful distance . '
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 29]: I wish I could let it into me , Wilfrid , ' said Charley , after we had been walking in silence for some time along the grass .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 9]: ` Let what into you , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 11]: ` The night and the blue and the stars . '
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 10]: ` Why do n't you , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 6]: I hate being taken in .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 16]: The more pleasant a self-deception , the less I choose to submit to it . '
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 5]: ` That is reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 8]: But where lies the deception ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 9]: I do n't say it 's a deception .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 11]: I only do n't know that it is n't . '
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 6]: ` Please explain . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 12]: I mean what you call the beauty of the night . '
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 11]: ` Surely there can be little question of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 7]: ` Ever so little is enough .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 43]: Suppose I asked you wherein its beauty consisted : would you be satisfied if I said -- In the arrangement of the blue and the white , with the sparkles of yellow , and the colours about the scarce visible moon ? '
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 4]: ` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 41]: I should reply that it lay in the gracious peace of the whole -- troubled only with the sense of some lovely secret behind , of which itself was but the half-modelled representation , and therefore the reluctant outcome . '
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 32]: ` Suppose I rejected the latter half of what you say , admitting the former , but judging it only the fortuitous result of the half-necessary , half-fortuitous concurrences of nature .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 96]: Suppose I said : -- The air which is necessary to our life , happens to be blue ; the stars ca n't help shining through it and making it look deep ; and the clouds are just there because they must be somewhere till they fall again ; all which is more agreeable to us than fog because we feel more comfortable in weather of the sort , whence , through complacency and habit , we have got to call it beautiful : -- suppose I said this , would you accept it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 13]: ` Such a theory would destroy my delight in nature altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 10]: ` Well , is n't it the truth ? '
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 34]: ` It would be easy to show that the sense of beauty does not spring from any amount of comfort ; but I do not care to pursue the argument from that starting-point .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 63]: -- I confess when you have once waked the questioning spirit , and I look up at the clouds and the stars with what I may call sharpened eyes -- eyes , that is , which assert their seeing , and so render themselves incapable for the time of submitting to impressions , I am as blind as any Sadducee could desire .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 20]: I see blue , and white , and gold , and , in short , a tent-roof somewhat ornate .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 35]: I dare say if I were in a miserable mood , having been deceived and disappointed like Hamlet , I should with him see there nothing but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 44]: But I know that when I am passive to its powers , I am aware of a presence altogether different -- of a something at once soothing and elevating , powerful to move shame -- even contrition and the desire of amendment . '
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 10]: ` Yes , yes , ' said Charley hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 112]: ` But let me suppose further -- and , perhaps you will allow , better -- that this blueness -- I take a part for the whole -- belongs essentially and of necessity to the atmosphere , itself so essential to our physical life ; suppose also that this blue has essential relation to our spiritual nature -- taking for the moment our spiritual nature for granted -- suppose , in a word , all nature so related , not only to our physical but to our spiritual nature , that it and we form an organic whole full of action and reaction between the parts -- would that satisfy you ?
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 15]: Would it enable you to look on the sky this night with absolute pleasure ?
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 7]: would you want nothing more ? '
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 9]: I thought for a little before I answered .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 18]: ` No , Charley , ' I said at last -- ` it would not satisfy me .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 36]: For it would indicate that beauty might be , after all , but the projection of my own mind -- the name I gave to a harmony between that around me and that within me .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 9]: There would then be nothing absolute in beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 9]: There would be no such thing in itself .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 34]: It would exist only as a phase of me when I was in a certain mood ; and when I was earthly-minded , passionate , or troubled , it would be _ no_where .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 45]: But in my best moods I feel that in nature lies the form and fashion of a peace and grandeur so much beyond anything in me , that they rouse the sense of poverty and incompleteness and blame in the want of them . '
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 12]: ` Do you perceive whither you are leading yourself ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 8]: I would rather hear you say . '
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 76]: ` To this then -- that the peace and grandeur of which you speak must be a mere accident , therefore an unreality and pure _ appearance _ , or the outcome and representation of a peace and grandeur which , not to be found in us , yet exist , and make use of this frame of things to set forth and manifest themselves in order that we may recognize and desire them . '
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 6]: ` Granted -- heartily . '
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 77]: ` In other words -- you lead yourself inevitably to a God manifest in nature -- not as a powerful being -- that is a theme absolutely without interest to me -- but as possessed in himself of the original pre-existent beauty , the counterpart of which in us we call art , and who has fashioned us so that we must fall down and worship the image of himself which he has set up . '
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 7]: ` That 's good , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 11]: I 'm so glad you 've worked that out ! '
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 13]: ` It does n't in the least follow that I believe it .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 25]: I can not even say I wish I did : -- for what I know , that might be to wish to be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 23]: Of all miseries -- to believe in a lovely thing and find it not true -- that must be the worst . '
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 14]: ` You might never find it out , though , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 16]: ` You might be able to comfort yourself with it all your life . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 9]: I was wrong , ' he cried fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 14]: ` Never to find it out would be the hell of all hells .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 9]: Wilfrid , I am ashamed of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 14]: ` So should I be , Charley , if I had meant it .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 8]: I only wanted to make you speak .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 6]: I agree with you entirely .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 36]: But I _ do _ wish we could be _ quite _ sure of it ; for I do n't believe any man can ever be sure of a thing that is not true . '
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 20]: ` My father is sure that the love of nature is not only a delusion , but a snare .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 25]: I should have no right to object , were he not equally sure of the existence of a God who created and rules it .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 20]: By the way , if I believed in a God , I should say _ create_s not _ create_d .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 54]: I told him once , not long ago , when he fell out upon nature -- he had laid hands on a copy of _ Endymion _ belonging to me -- I do n't know how the devil he got it -- I asked him whether he thought the devil made the world .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 14]: You should have seen the white wrath he went into at the question !
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 16]: I told him it was generally believed one or the other did make the world .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 14]: He told me God made the world , but sin had unmade it .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 13]: I asked him if it was sin that made it so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 13]: He said it was sin that made me think it so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 16]: I remarked how very ugly it must have looked when God had just finished it !
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 12]: He called me a blasphemer , and walked to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 49]: I stopped him for a moment by saying that I thought , after all , he must be right , for according to geologists the world must have been a horrible place , and full of the most hideous creatures , before sin came and made it lovely .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 32]: When he saw my drift , he strode up to me like -- well , very like his own God , I should think -- and was going to strike me .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 17]: I looked him in the eyes without moving , as if he had been a madman .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 7]: He turned and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 15]: I left the house , and went back to London the same night . '
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 11]: Charley , Charley , that was too bad ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 12]: I knew it , Wilfrid , and yet I did it !
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 46]: But if your father had made a downright coward of you , afraid to speak the truth , or show what you were thinking , you also might find that , when anger gave you a fictitious courage , you could not help breaking out .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 28]: It 's only another form of cowardice , I know ; and I am as much ashamed of it as you could wish me to be . '
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 11]: ` Have you made it up with him since ? '
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 9]: ` I 've never seen him since . '
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 9]: ` Have n't you written , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 5]: Where 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 6]: He never would understand me .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 21]: He knows no more of the condition of my mind than he does of the other side of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 43]: If I offered such , he would put aside all apology for my behaviour to him -- repudiating himself , and telling me it was the wrath of an offended God , not of an earthly parent , I had to deprecate .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 28]: If I told him I had only spoken against his false God -- how far would that go to mend the matter , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 8]: ` Not far , I must allow .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 8]: But I am very sorry . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 29]: I would n't care if I could be sure of anything -- or even sure that , if I were sure , I should n't be mistaken . '
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 12]: ` I 'm afraid you 're very morbid , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 3]: ` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 20]: But you can not deny that my father is sure of things that you believe utterly false . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 44]: I suspect , however , that , if we were able to get a bird 's - eye view of his mind and all its workings , we should discover that what he called assurance was not the condition you would call such .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 13]: You would find it was not the certainty you covet . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 15]: I _ have _ thought of that , and it is my only comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 9]: But I am sick of the whole subject .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 4]: See that cloud !
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 10]: Is n't it like Death on the pale horse ?
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 30]: What fun it must be for the cherubs , on such a night as this , to go blowing the clouds into fantastic shapes with their trumpet cheeks ! '
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 19]: Assurance was ever what Charley wanted , and unhappily the sense of intellectual insecurity weakened his moral action .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 34]: Once more I reveal a haunting uneasiness in the expression of a hope that the ordered character of the conversation I have just set down may not render it incredible to my reader .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 6]: I record the result alone .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 34]: The talk itself was far more desultory , and in consequence of questions , objections , and explanations , divaricated much from the comparatively direct line I have endeavoured to give it here .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 27]: In the hope of making my reader understand both Charley and myself , I have sought to make the winding and rough path straight and smooth .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 2]: TAPESTRY .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 38]: Having heard what I was about at the Hall , Charley expressed a desire to take a share in my labours , especially as thereby he would be able to see more of his mother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 18]: I took him straight to the book-rooms , and we were hard at work when Clara entered .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 13]: ` Here is your old friend Charley Osborne , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 12]: ` You remember Miss Coningham , Charley , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 21]: He advanced in what seemed a strangely embarrassed -- indeed , rather sheepish manner , altogether unlike his usual bearing .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 14]: I attributed it to a doubt whether Clara would acknowledge their old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 35]: On her part , she met him with some frankness , but I thought also a rather embarrassed look , which was the more surprising as I had let her know he was coming .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 16]: But they shook hands , and in a little while we were all chatting comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 13]: ` Shall I go and tell Mrs Osborne you are here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 15]: ` Yes , if you please , ' said Charley , and she went .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 10]: In a few minutes Mrs Osborne and Mary entered .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 54]: The meeting was full of affection , but to my eye looked like a meeting of the living and the dead in a dream -- there was such an evident sadness in it , as if each was dimly aware that they met but in appearance , and were in reality far asunder .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 45]: I could not doubt that however much they loved him , and however little they sympathized with his father 's treatment of him , his mother and sister yet regarded him as separated from them by a great gulf -- that of culpable unbelief .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 48]: But they seemed therefore only the more anxious to please and serve him -- their anxiety revealing itself in an eagerness painfully like the service offered to one whom the doctors had given up , and who may now have any indulgence he happens to fancy . '
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 30]: I say , mother , ' said Charley , who seemed to strive after an airier manner even than usual -- ` could n't you come and help us ?
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 7]: It would be so jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 13]: ` No , my dear ; I must n't leave Lady Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 8]: That would be rude , you know .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 8]: But I dare say Mary might . '
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 7]: ` Oh , please , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 13]: I should like it so much -- especially if Clara would stop !
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 14]: But perhaps Mr Cumbermede -- we ought to have asked him first . '
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 16]: ` Yes -- to be sure -- he 's the foreman , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 15]: ` But he 's not a bad fellow , and wo n't be disobliging .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 19]: Only you must do as he tells you , or it 'll be the worse for us all .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 8]: _ I _ know him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 10]: I shall be delighted , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 10]: I can give both the ladies plenty to do .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 12]: Indeed I regard Miss Coningham as one of my hands already .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 13]: Wo n't Miss Brotherton honour us to-day , Miss Coningham ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 11]: I will go and ask her , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 4]: They all withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 15]: In a little while I had four assistants , and we got on famously .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 58]: The carpenter had been hard at work , and the room next the armoury , the oak-panelling of which had shown considerable signs of decay , had been repaired , and the shelves , which were in tolerable condition , were now ready to receive their burden , and reflect the first rays of a dawning order .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 26]: Plenty of talk went on during the dusting and arranging of the books by their size , which was the first step towards a cosmos .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 40]: There was a certain playful naïveté about Charley 's manner and speech , when he was happy , which gave him an instant advantage with women , and even made the impression of wit where there was only grace .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 66]: Although he was perfectly capable , however , of engaging to any extent in the _ badinage _ which has ever been in place between young men and women since dawning humanity was first aware of a lovely difference , there was always a certain indescribable dignity about what he said which I now see could have come only from a _ believing _ heart .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 24]: I use the word advisedly , but would rather my reader should find what I mean than require me to explain it fully .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 18]: Belief , to my mind , lies chiefly in the practical recognition of the high and pure .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 14]: Miss Brotherton looked considerably puzzled sometimes , and indeed out of her element .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 49]: But her dignity had no chance with so many young people , and was compelled to thaw visibly ; and while growing more friendly with the others , she could not avoid unbending towards me also , notwithstanding I was a neighbour and the son of a dairy-farmer .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 26]: Mary Osborne took little part in the fun beyond a smile , or in the more solid conversation beyond an assent or an ordinary remark .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 8]: I did not find her very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 10]: An onlooker would probably have said she lacked expression .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 15]: But the stillness upon her face bore to me the shadow of a reproof .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 16]: Perhaps it was only a want of sympathy with what was going on around her .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 23]: Perhaps her soul was either far withdrawn from its present circumstances , or not yet awake to the general interests of life .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 21]: There was little in the form or hue of her countenance to move admiration , beyond a complexion without spot .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 29]: It was very fair and delicate , with little more colour in it than in the white rose , which but the faintest warmth redeems from dead whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 56]: Her features were good in form , but in no way remarkable ; her eyes were of the so-called hazel , which consists of a mingling of brown and green ; her figure was good , but seemed unelastic , and she had nothing of her brother 's gaiety or grace of movement or expression .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 29]: I do not mean that either her motions or her speech was clumsy -- there was simply nothing to remark in them beyond the absence of anything special .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 31]: In a word , I did not find her interesting , save as the sister of my delightful Charley , and the sharer of his mother 's griefs concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 39]: ` If I had as good help in the afternoon , ' I said , ` we should have all the books on the shelves to-night , and be able to set about assorting them to-morrow . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 16]: I am sorry I can not come this afternoon , ' said Miss Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 10]: I should have been most happy if I could .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 9]: It is really very pleasant notwithstanding the dust .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 14]: But Mrs Osborne and mamma want me to go with them to Minstercombe .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 12]: You will lunch with us to-day , wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 7]: she added , turning to Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 47]: ` Thank you , Miss Brotherton , ' he replied ; ' I should have been delighted , but I am not my own master -- I am Cumbermede 's slave at present , and can eat and drink only when and where he chooses . '
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 16]: ` You _ must _ stay with your mother , Charley , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 9]: ` You can not refuse Miss Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 40]: She could thereupon scarcely avoid extending the invitation to me , but I declined it on some pretext or other , and I was again , thanks to Lilith , back from my dinner before they had finished luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 30]: The carriage was at the door when I rode up , and the moment I heard it drive away , I went to the dining-room to find my coadjutors .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 8]: The only person there was Miss Pease .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 5]: A thought struck me .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 13]: ` Wo n't you come and help us , Miss Pease ? '
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 27]: I have lost one of my assistants , and I am very anxious to get the room we are at now so far finished to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 20]: A smile found its way to her cold eyes , and set the blue sparkling for one briefest moment .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 18]: ` It is very kind of you , Mr Cumbermede , but -- ' ` Kind ! '
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 13]: I exclaimed -- ' I want your help , Miss Pease . '
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 15]: ` I 'm afraid -- ' ` Lady Brotherton ca n't want you now .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 4]: Do oblige me .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 7]: You will find it fun . '
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 16]: She smiled outright -- evidently at the fancy of any relation between her and fun .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 21]: ` Do go and put a cap on , and a cotton dress , and come , ' I persisted .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 8]: Without another word she left the room .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 30]: I was still alone in the library when she came to me , and having shown her what I wanted , we were already busy when the rest arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 5]: ` Oh , Peasey !
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 5]: Are you there ? '
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 11]: said Clara , as she entered -- not unkindly . '
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 23]: I have got a substitute for Miss Brotherton , you see , Clara -- Miss Coningham -- I beg your pardon . '
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 10]: ` There 's no occasion to beg my pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 11]: Why should n't you call me Clara if you like ?
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 8]: It _ is _ my name . '
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 17]: ` Charley might be taking the same liberty , ' I returned , extemporizing a reason .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 14]: ` And why _ should n't _ Charley take the same liberty ? '
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 3]: she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 26]: ` For no reason that I know , ' I answered , a trifle hurt , ` if it be agreeable to the lady . '
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 9]: ` And the gentleman , ' she amended .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 9]: ` And the gentleman , ' I added .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 4]: ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 9]: Then we are all good boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 12]: Now , Peasey , I 'm very glad you 're come .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 23]: Only mind you get back to your place before the ogress returns , or you 'll have your head snapped off . '
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 17]: Was I right , or was it the result of the slight offence I had taken ?
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 29]: Was the gracious , graceful , naïve , playful , daring woman -- or could she be -- or had she been just the least little bit vulgar ?
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 30]: I am afraid I was then more sensitive to vulgarity in a woman , real or fancied , than even to wickedness -- at least I thought I was .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 30]: At all events , the first _ conviction _ of anything common or unrefined in a woman would at once have placed me beyond the sphere of her attraction .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 53]: But I had no time to think the suggestion over now ; and in a few minutes -- whether she saw the cloud on my face I can not tell -- Clara had given me a look and a smile which banished the possibility of my thinking about it for the present .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 11]: Miss Pease worked more diligently than any of the party .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 50]: She seldom spoke , and when she did , it was in a gentle , subdued , almost mournful tone ; but the company of the young people , without the restraint of her mistress , was evidently grateful to what of youth yet remained in her oppressed being .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 25]: Before it was dark we had got the books all upon the shelves , and leaving Charley with the ladies , I walked home .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 38]: I found Styles had got everything out of the lumber-room except a heavy oak chest in the corner , which , our united strength being insufficient to displace it , I concluded was fixed to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 22]: I collected all the keys my aunt had left behind her , but sought the key of this chest in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 13]: For my uncle , I never saw a key in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 23]: Even what little money he might have in the house , was only put away at the back of an open drawer .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 13]: For the present , therefore , we had to leave it undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 12]: When Charley came home we went to look at it together .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 10]: It was of oak , and somewhat elaborately carved .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 9]: I was very restless in bed that night .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 22]: The air was close and hot , and as often as I dropped half asleep I woke again with a start .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 10]: My thoughts kept stupidly running on the old chest .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 6]: It had mechanically possessed me .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 57]: I felt no disturbing curiosity concerning its contents ; I was not annoyed at the want of the key ; it was only that , like a nursery rhyme that keeps repeating itself over and over in the half-sleeping brain , this chest kept rising before me till I was out of patience with its intrusiveness .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 27]: It brought me wide awake at last ; and I thought , as I could not sleep , I would have a search for the key .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 45]: I got out of bed , put on my dressing-gown and slippers , lighted my chamber-candle , and made an inroad upon the contents of the closet in my room , which had apparently remained undisturbed since the morning when I missed my watch .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 9]: I believe I had never entered it since .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 41]: Almost the first thing I came upon was the pendulum , which woke a strange sensation for which I could not account , until by slow degrees the twilight memory of the incidents connected with it half dawned upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 14]: I searched the whole place , but not a key could I find .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 34]: I started violently at the sound of something like a groan , and for the briefest imaginable moment forgot that my grannie was dead , and thought it must come from her room .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 24]: It may be remembered that such a sound had led me to her in the middle of the night on which she died .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 36]: Whether I really heard the sound , or only fancied I heard it -- by some half-mechanical action of the brain , roused by the association of ideas -- I do not even yet know .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 54]: It may have been changed or expanded into a groan , from one of those innumerable sounds heard in every old house in the stillness of the night ; for such , in the absence of the correction given by other sounds , assume place and proportion as it were at their pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 30]: What lady has not at midnight mistaken the trail of her own dress on the carpet , in a silent house , for some tumult in a distant room ?
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 55]: Curious to say , however , it now led to the same action as the groan I had heard so many years before ; for I caught up my candle at once , and took my way down to the kitchen , and up the winding stair behind the chimney to grannie 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 75]: Strange as it may seem , I had not been in it since my return ; for my thoughts had been so entirely occupied with other things , that , although I now and then looked forward with considerable expectation to a thorough search of the place , especially of the bureau , I kept it up as a _ bonne bouche _ , the anticipation of which was consolation enough for the postponement .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 23]: I confess it was with no little quavering of the spirit that I sought this chamber in the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 90]: For , by its association with one who had from my earliest recollection seemed like something forgotten and left behind in the onward rush of life , it was , far more than anything else in the house , like a piece of the past embedded in the present -- a fragment that had been , by some eddy in the stream of time , prevented from gliding away down its course , and left to lie for ever in a cranny of the solid shore of unmoving space .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 40]: But although subject to more than the ordinary tremor at the thought of unknown and invisible presences , I must say for myself that I had never yielded so far as to allow such tremor to govern my actions .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 59]: Even in my dreams I have resisted ghostly terrors , and can recall one in which I so far conquered a lady-ghost who took every means of overcoming me with terror , that at length she fell in love with me , whereupon my fear vanished utterly -- a conceited fancy , and as such let it fare .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 30]: I opened the door then with some trembling , half expecting to see first the white of my grannie 's cap against the tall back of her dark chair .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 13]: But my senses were sound , and no such illusion seized me .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 9]: All was empty , cheerless , and musty .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 19]: Grannie 's bed , with its white curtains , looked as if it were mouldering away after her .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 11]: The dust lay thick on the counterpane of patchwork silk .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 9]: The bureau stood silent with all its secrets .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 40]: In the fire-place was the same brushwood and coals which Nannie laid the morning of grannie 's death : interrupted by the discovery of my presence , she had left it , and that fire had never been lighted .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 30]: Half for the sake of companionship , half because the air felt sepulchral and I was thinly clad , I put my candle to it and it blazed up .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 30]: My courage revived , and after a little more gazing about the room , I ventured to sit down in my grannie 's chair and watch the growing fire .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 26]: Warned , however , by the shortness of my candle , I soon rose to proceed with my search , and turned towards the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 9]: Here , however , the same difficulty occurred .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 25]: The top of the bureau was locked as when I had last tried it , and not one of my keys would fit it .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 30]: At a loss what to do or where to search , I dropped again into the chair by the fire , and my eyes went roving about the room .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 12]: They fell upon a black dress which hung against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 26]: At the same moment I remembered that , when she gave me the watch , she took the keys of the bureau from her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 25]: I went to the dress and found a pocket , not indeed in the dress , but hanging under it from the same peg .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 5]: There her keys were !
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 37]: It would have been a marvel to me how my aunt came to leave them undisturbed all those years , but for the instant suggestion that my uncle must have expressed a wish to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 8]: With eager hand I opened the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 58]: Besides many trinkets in the drawers , some of them of exceedingly antique form , and , I fancied , of considerable value , I found in the pigeon-holes what I was far more pleased to discover -- a good many letters , carefully tied in small bundles , with ribbon which had lost all determinable colour .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 55]: These I reserved to take an early opportunity of reading , but replaced for the present , and , having come at last upon one hopeful-looking key , I made haste to return before my candle , which was already flickering in the socket , should go out altogether , and leave me darkling .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 16]: When I reached the kitchen , however , I found the grey dawn already breaking .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 14]: I retired once more to my chamber , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 13]: In the morning , my first care was to try the key .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 3]: It fitted .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 11]: I oiled it well , and then tried the lock .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 22]: I had to use considerable force , but at last there came a great clang that echoed through the empty room .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 16]: When I raised the lid , I knew by the weight it was of iron .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 14]: In fact , the whole chest was iron with a casing of oak .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 22]: The lock threw eight bolts , which laid hold of a rim that ran all round the lip of the chest .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 14]: It was full of ` very ancient and fish-like ' papers and parchments .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 58]: I do not know whether my father or grandfather had ever disturbed them , but I am certain my uncle never had , for , as far back as I can remember , the part of the room where it stood was filled with what had been , at one time and another , condemned as lumber .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 47]: Charley was intensely interested in the discovery , and would have sat down at once to examine the contents of the chest , had I not persuaded him to leave them till the afternoon , that we might get on with our work at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 29]: The second room was now ready for the carpenter , but , having had a peep of tapestry behind the shelves , a new thought had struck me .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 20]: If it was in good preservation , it would be out of the question to hide it behind books .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 7]: I fear I am getting tedious .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 33]: My apology for diffuseness in this part of my narrative is that some threads of the fringe of my own fate show every now and then in the record of these proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 20]: I confess also that I hang back from certain things which are pressing nearer with their claim for record .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 20]: When we reached the Hall , I took the carpenter with me , and had the bookshelves taken down .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 26]: To my disappointment we found that an oblong piece of some size was missing from the centre of the tapestry on one of the walls .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 11]: That which covered the rest of the room was entire .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 13]: It was all of good Gobelins work -- somewhat tame in colour .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 64]: The damaged portion represented a wooded landscape with water and reedy flowers and aquatic fowl , towards which in the distance came a hunter with a crossbow in his hand , and a queer , lurcher-looking dog bounding uncouthly at his heel ; the edge of the vacant space cut off the dog 's tail and the top of the man 's crossbow .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 7]: I went to find Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 13]: He was in the dining-room , where they had just finished breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 7]: ` Ah , Mr Cumbermede ! '
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 19]: he said , rising as I entered , and holding out his hand -- ` here already ? '
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 27]: ` We have uncovered some tapestry , Sir Giles , and I want you to come and look at it , if you please . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 7]: I will , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 14]: ` Would any of you ladies like to go and see it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 6]: His daughter and Clara rose .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 8]: Lady Brotherton and Mrs Osborne sat still .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 11]: Mary , glancing at her mother , remained seated also .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 10]: ` Wo n't you come , Miss Pease ? '
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 37]: She looked almost alarmed at the audacity of the proposal , and murmured , ` No , thank you , ' with a glance at Lady Brotherton , which appeared as involuntary as it was timid .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 8]: ` Is my son with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 4]: asked Mrs Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 7]: I told her he was . '
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 17]: I shall look in upon you before the morning is over , ' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 22]: They were all pleased with the tapestry , and the ladies offered several conjectures as to the cause of the mutilation .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 20]: ` It would be a shame to cover it up again -- would it not , Sir Giles ? '
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 3]: I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 9]: ` Indeed it would , ' he assented .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 14]: ` If it were n't for that broken piece , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 6]: ` That spoils it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 15]: _ I _ should have the books up again as soon as possible . '
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 11]: ` It does look shabby , ' said Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 17]: I ca n't say I should enjoy having anything so defective always before my eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 23]: ` We must have it taken down very carefully , Hobbes , ' said Sir Giles , turning to the carpenter . '
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 11]: _ Must _ it come down , Sir Giles ? '
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 4]: I interposed . '
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 7]: I think it would be risky .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 66]: No one knows how long it has been there , and though it might hang where it is for a century yet , and look nothing the worse , it ca n't be strong , and at best we could not get it down without some injury , while it is a great chance if it would fit any other place half as well . '
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 9]: ` What do you propose , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 46]: ` This is the largest room of the six , and the best lighted -- with that lovely oriel window : I would venture to propose , Sir Giles , that it should be left clear of books and fitted up as a reading-room . '
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 17]: ` But how would you deal with that frightful _ lacuna _ in the tapestry ? '
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 25]: ` Yes , ' said Sir Giles ; ` it wo n't look handsome , I fear -- do what you will . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 13]: I think I know how to manage it , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 19]: ` If I succeed to your satisfaction , will you allow me to carry out the project ? '
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 13]: ` But what are we to do with the books , then ?
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 9]: We sha n't have room for them . '
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 13]: ` Could n't you let me have the next room beyond ? '
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 15]: ` You mean to turn me out , I suppose , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 9]: ` Is there tapestry on your walls ? '
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 11]: ` Not a thread -- all wainscot -- painted . '
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 11]: ` Then your room would be the very thing . '
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 14]: ` It is much larger than any of these , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 19]: ` Then do let us have it for the library , Sir Giles , ' I entreated . '
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 17]: I will see what Lady Brotherton says , ' he replied , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 10]: In a few minutes we heard his step returning .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 19]: ` Lady Brotherton has no particular objection to giving up the room you want , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 18]: ` Will you see Mrs Wilson , Clara , and arrange with her for your accommodation ? '
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 4]: ` With pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 24]: I do n't mind where I 'm put -- unless it be in Lord Edward 's room -- where the ghost is . '
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 9]: ` You mean the one next to ours ?
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 29]: There is no ghost there , I assure you , ' said Sir Giles , laughing , as he again left the room with short , heavy steps .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 12]: ` Manage it all to your own mind , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 13]: I shall be satisfied , ' he called back as he went .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 24]: ` Until further notice , ' I said , with grandiloquence , ' I request that no one may come into this room .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 22]: If you are kind enough to assort the books we put up yesterday , oblige me by going through the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 8]: I must find Mrs Wilson . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 11]: I will go with you , ' said Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 12]: I wonder where the old thing will want to put me .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 32]: I 'm not going where I do n't like , I can tell her , ' she added , following me down the stair and across the hall and the court .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 8]: We found the housekeeper in her room .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 8]: I accosted her in a friendly way .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 7]: She made but a bare response .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 20]: ` Would you kindly show me where I slept that night I lost my sword , Mrs Wilson ? '
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 24]: I know nothing about your sword , Mr Cumbermede , ' she answered , shaking her head and pursing up her mouth . '
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 26]: I do n't ask you anything about it , Mrs Wilson ; I only ask you where I slept the night I lost it . '
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 33]: ` Really , Mr Cumbermede , you can hardly expect me to remember in what room a visitor slept -- let me see -- it must be twelve or fifteen years ago !
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 9]: I do not take it upon me . '
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 5]: never mind , then .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 33]: I referred to the circumstances of that night , thinking they might help you to remember the room ; but it is of no consequence ; I shall find it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 13]: Miss Coningham will , I hope , help me in the search .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 11]: She knows the house better than I do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 19]: I must attend to my own business first , if you please , sir , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 15]: ` Mrs Wilson , I am ordered out of my room by Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 12]: You must find me fresh quarters , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 4]: Mrs Wilson stared .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 18]: ` Do you mean , miss , that you want your things moved to another bed-room ? '
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 14]: ` That _ is _ what I mean , Mrs Wilson . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 13]: I must see what Lady Brotherton says to it , miss . '
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 8]: ` Do , by all means . '
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 15]: I saw that Clara was bent on annoying her old enemy , and interposed .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 30]: ` Sir Giles and Lady Brotherton have agreed to let me have Miss Coningham 's room for an addition to the library , Mrs Wilson , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 10]: She looked very grim , but made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 6]: We turned and left her .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 22]: She stood for a moment as if thinking , and then , taking down her bunch of keys , followed us .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 35]: ` If you will come this way , ' she said , stopping just behind us at another door in the court , ' I think I can show you the room you want .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 14]: But really , Mr Cumbermede , you are turning the place upside down .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 29]: If I had thought it would come to this -- ' ' I hope to do so a little more yet , Mrs Wilson , ' I interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 14]: ` But I am sure you will be pleased with the result . '
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 33]: She did not reply , but led the way up a stair , across the little open gallery , and by passages I did not remember , to the room I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 13]: It was in precisely the same condition as when I occupied it .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 22]: ` This is the room , I believe , ' she said , as she unlocked and threw open the door .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 11]: ` Perhaps it would suit you , Miss Coningham ? '
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 10]: ` Not in the least , ' answered Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 15]: ` Who knows which of my small possessions might vanish before the morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 9]: The housekeeper 's face grew turkey-red with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 21]: ` Mr Cumbermede has been filling your head with some of his romances , I see , Miss Clara ! '
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 16]: I laughed , for I did not care to show myself offended with her rudeness .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 21]: ` Never you mind , ' said Clara ; ' I am _ not _ going to sleep there . '
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 17]: ` Very good , ' said Mrs Wilson , in a tone of offence severely restrained .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 12]: ` Will you show me the way to the library ? '
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 4]: I requested . '
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 21]: I will , ' said Clara ; ' I know it as well as Mrs Wilson -- every bit . '
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 25]: ` Then that is all I want at present , Mrs Wilson , ' I said , as we came out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 15]: ` Do n't lock the door , though , please , ' I added .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 13]: ` Or , if you do , give me the key . '
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 12]: She left the door open , and us in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 7]: Clara led me to the library .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 8]: There we found Charley waiting our return .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 14]: ` Will you take that little boy to his mother , Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 8]: I do n't want him here to-day .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 15]: We 'll have a look over those papers in the evening , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 10]: ` That 's right , ' said Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 16]: I hope Charley will help you to a little rational interest in your own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 44]: I am quite bewildered to think that an author , not to say a young man , the sole remnant of an ancient family , however humble , should n't even know whether he had any papers in the house or not . '
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 15]: ` We 've come upon a glorious nest of such addled eggs , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 14]: Charley and I are going to blow them to-night , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 14]: ` You never know when such eggs are addled , ' retorted Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 27]: ` You 'd better put them under some sensible fowl or other first , ' she added , looking back from the door as they went .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 35]: I turned to the carpenter 's tool-basket , and taking from it an old chisel , a screw-driver , and a pair of pincers , went back to the room we had just left .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 8]: There could be no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 19]: There was the tip of the dog 's tail , and the top of the hunter 's crossbow .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 18]: But my reader may not have retained in her memory the facts to which I implicitly refer .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 27]: I would therefore , to spare repetition , beg her to look back to chapter xiv. , containing the account of the loss of my sword .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 60]: In the consternation caused me by the discovery that this loss was no dream of the night , I had never thought of examining the wall of the chamber , to see whether there was in it a door or not ; but I saw now at once plainly enough that the inserted patch did cover a small door .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 50]: Opening it , I found within , a creaking wooden stair , leading up to another low door , which , fashioned like the door of a companion , opened upon the roof : -- nowhere , except in the towers , had the Hall more than two stories .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 57]: As soon as I had drawn back the bolt and stepped out , I found myself standing at the foot of an ornate stack of chimneys , and remembered quite well having tried the door that night Clara and I were shut out on the leads -- the same night on which my sword was stolen .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 23]: For the first time the question now rose in my mind whether Mrs Wilson could have been in league with Mr Close .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 20]: Was it likely I should have been placed in a room so entirely fitted to his purposes by accident ?
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 42]: But I could not imagine any respectable woman running such a risk of terrifying a child out of his senses , even if she could have connived at his being robbed of what she might well judge unsuitable for his possession .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 14]: Descending again to the bed-room , I set to work with my tools .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 15]: The utmost care was necessary , for the threads were weak with old age .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 21]: I had only one or two slight mishaps , however , succeeding on the whole better than I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 22]: Leaving the door denuded of its covering , I took the patch on my arm , and again sought the library .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 28]: Hobbes 's surprise , and indeed pleasure , when he saw that my plunder not only fitted the gap , but completed the design , was great .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 29]: I directed him to get the whole piece down as carefully as he could , and went to extract , if possible , a favour from Lady Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 34]: She was of course very stiff -- no doubt she would have called it dignified ; but I did all I could to please her , and perhaps in some small measure succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 56]: After representing , amongst other advantages , what an addition a suite of rooms filled with a valuable library must be to the capacity of the house for the reception and entertainment of guests , I ventured at last to beg the services of Miss Pease for the repair of the bit of the tapestry .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 29]: She rang the bell , sent for Miss Pease , and ordered her , in a style of the coldest arrogance , to put herself under my direction .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 18]: She followed me to the door in the meekest manner , but declined the arm I offered .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 62]: As we went I explained what I wanted , saying I could not trust it to any hands but those of a lady , expressing a hope that she would not think I had taken too great a liberty , and begging her to say nothing about the work itself , as I wished to surprise Sir Giles and my assistants .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 27]: She said she would be most happy to help me , but when she saw how much was wanted , she did look a little dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 43]: She went and fetched her work-basket at once , however , and set about it , tacking the edges to a strip of canvas , in preparation for some kind of darning , which would not , she hoped , be unsightly .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 64]: For a whole week she and the carpenter were the only persons I admitted , and while she gave to her darning every moment she could redeem from her attendance on Lady Brotherton , the carpenter and I were busy -- he cleaning and polishing , and I ranging the more deserted parts of the house to find furniture suitable for our purpose .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 58]: In Clara 's room was an old Turkey-carpet which we appropriated , and when we had the tapestry up again , which Miss Pease had at length restored in a marvellous manner -- surpassing my best hopes , and more like healing than repairing -- the place was to my eyes a very nest of dusky harmonies .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 4]: THE OLD CHEST .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 41]: I can not help dwelling for a moment on the scene , although it is not of the slightest consequence to my story , when Sir Giles and Lady Brotherton entered the reading-room of the resuscitated library of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 8]: It was a bright day of Autumn .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 5]: Outside all was brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 38]: The latticed oriel looked over the lawn and the park , where the trees had begun to gather those rich hues which could hardly be the heralds of death if it were the ugly thing it appears .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 28]: Beyond the fading woods rose a line of blue heights meeting the more ethereal blue of the sky , now faded to a colder and paler tint .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 27]: The dappled skins of the fallow deer glimmered through the trees , and the whiter ones among them cast a light round them in the shadows .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 29]: Through the trees that on one side descended to the meadow below , came the shine of the water where the little brook had spread into still pools .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 10]: All without was bright with sunshine and clear air .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 21]: But when you turned , all was dark , sombre , and rich , like an Autumn ten times faded .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 44]: Through the open door of the next room on one side , you saw the shelves full of books , and from beyond , through the narrow uplifted door , came the glimmer of the weapons on the wall of the little armoury .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 52]: Two ancient tapestry-covered settees , in which the ravages of moth and worm had been met by a skilful repair of chisel and needle , a heavy table of oak , with carved sides as black as ebony , and a few old , straight-backed chairs , were the sole furniture .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 25]: Sir Giles expressed much pleasure , and Lady Brotherton , beginning to enter a little into my plans , was more gracious than hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 86]: ` We must give a party as soon as you have finished , Mr Cumbermede , ' she said ; ` and -- ' ` That will be some time yet , ' I interrupted , not desiring the invitation she seemed about to force herself to utter ; ` and I fear there are not many in this neighbourhood who will appreciate the rarity and value of the library -- if the other rooms should turn out as rich as that one . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 14]: I believe old books _ are _ expensive now-a-days , ' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 11]: ` They are more sought after , I understand . '
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 13]: We resumed our work with fresh vigour , and got on faster .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 10]: Both Clara and Mary were assiduous in their help .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 25]: To go back for a little to my own old chest -- we found it , as I said , full of musty papers .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 119]: After turning over a few , seeming , to my uneducated eye , deeds and wills and such like , out of which it was evident I could gather no barest meaning without a labour I was not inclined to expend on them -- for I had no pleasure in such details as involved nothing of the picturesque -- I threw the one in my hand upon the heap already taken from the box , and to the indignation of Charley , who was absorbed in one of them , and had not spoken a word for at least a quarter of an hour , exclaimed -- ` Come , Charley ; I 'm sick of the rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 11]: Let 's go and have a walk before supper . '
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 4]: ` Rubbish ! '
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 12]: he repeated ; ' I am ashamed of you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 9]: I see Clara has been setting you on .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 10]: I wonder what she 's got in her head .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 17]: I am sure I have quite a sufficient regard for family history and all that . '
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 6]: ` Very like it ! '
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 14]: said Charley -- ` calling such a chestful as this rubbish ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 76]: I am pleased enough to possess it , ' I said ; ` but if they had been such books as some of those at the Hall -- ' ` Look here , then , ' he said , stooping over the chest , and with some difficulty hauling out a great folio which he had discovered below , but had not yet examined -- ` just see what you can make of that . '
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 7]: I opened the title-page rather eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 3]: I stared .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 6]: Could I believe my eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 24]: First of all on the top of it , in the neatest old hand , was written -- ` Guilfrid Combremead His Boke .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 3]: 1630 . '
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 25]: Then followed what I will not write , lest this MS. should by any accident fall into the hands of book-hunters before my death .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 27]: I jumped to my feet , gave a shout that brought Charley to his feet also , and danced about the empty room hugging the folio .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 8]: ` Have you lost your senses ? '
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 36]: said Charley ; but when he had a peep at the title-page , he became as much excited as myself , and it was some time before he could settle down to the papers again .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 16]: Like a bee over a flower-bed , I went dipping and sipping at my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 22]: Every word of the well-known lines bore a flavour of ancient verity such as I had never before perceived in them .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 30]: At length I looked up , and finding him as much absorbed as I had been myself -- ` Well , Charley , what are you finding there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 60]: ` Proof perhaps that you come of an older family than you think , ' he answered ; ` proof certainly that some part at least of the Moldwarp property was at one time joined to the Moat , and that you are of the same stock , a branch of which was afterwards raised to the present baronetage .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 25]: At least I have little doubt such is the case , though I can hardly say I am yet prepared to prove it . '
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 18]: ` You do n't mean I 'm of the same blood as -- as Geoffrey Brotherton ! '
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 17]: I would rather not , if it 's the same to you , Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 22]: I ca n't help it : that 's the way things point , ' he answered , throwing down the parchment .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 9]: ` But I ca n't read more now .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 8]: Let 's go and have a walk .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 16]: I 'll stop at home to-morrow and take a look over the whole set . '
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 8]: ` I 'll stop with you . '
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 6]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Well .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 2]: Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 7]: What are you finding there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 4]: I asked . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 7]: ` No , you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 10]: You 'll go and get on with your library .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 6]: I shall do better alone .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 15]: If I could only get a peep at the Moldwarp chest as well ! '
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 13]: ` But the place may have been bought and sold many times .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 22]: Just look here , though , ' I said , as I showed him the crest on my watch and seal .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 21]: ` Mind you look at the top of your spoon the next time you eat soup at the Hall . '
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 7]: ` That is unnecessary , quite .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 7]: I recognise the crest at once .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 25]: How strangely these cryptographs come drifting along the tide , like the gilded ornaments of a wreck after the hull has gone down ! '
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 40]: ` Or , like the mole or squint that re-appears in successive generations , the legacy of some long-forgotten ancestor , ' I said -- and several things unexplained occurred to me as possibly having a common solution . '
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 39]: I find , however , ' said Charley , ` that the name of Cumbermede is not mentioned in your papers more than about a hundred years back -- as far as I have yet made out . '
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 34]: ` That is odd , ' I returned , ` seeing that in the same chest we find that book with my name , surname and Christian , and the date 1630 . '
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 23]: ` It is strange , ' he acquiesced , ` and will perhaps require a somewhat complicated theory to meet it . '
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 18]: We began to talk of other matters , and , naturally enough , soon came to Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 24]: Charley was never ready to talk of her -- indeed , avoided the subject in a way that continued to perplex me . '
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 25]: I confess to you , Charley , ' I said , ` there is something about her I do not and can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 37]: It seems to me always as if she were -- I will not say underhand -- but as if she had some object in view -- some design upon you -- ' ` Upon me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 19]: exclaimed Charley , looking at me suddenly and with a face from which all the colour had fled .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 17]: ` No , no , Charley , not that , ' I answered , laughing . '
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 6]: I used the word impersonally .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 6]: I will be more cautious .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 31]: One would think we had been talking about a witch -- or a demon-lady -- you are so frightened at the notion of her having you in her eye . '
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 17]: He did not seem altogether relieved , and I caught an uneasy glance seeking my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 8]: ` But is n't she charming ? '
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 4]: I went on .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 13]: ` It is only to you I could talk about her so .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 11]: And after all it may be only a fancy . '
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 19]: He kept his face downwards and aside , as if he were pondering and coming to no conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 20]: The silence grew and grew until expectation ceased , and when I spoke again it was of something different .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 17]: My reader may be certain from all this that I was not in love with Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 56]: Her beauty and liveliness , with a gaiety which not seldom assumed the form of grace , attracted me much , it is true ; but nothing interferes more with the growth of any passion than a spirit of questioning , and , that once roused , love begins to cease and pass into pain .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 91]: Few , perhaps , could have arrived at the point of admiration I had reached without falling instantly therefrom into an abyss of absorbing passion ; but with me , inasmuch as I searched every feeling in the hope of finding in it the everlasting , there was in the present case a reiterated check , if not indeed recoil ; for I was not and could not make myself sure that Clara was upright ; -- perhaps the more commonplace word _ straightforward _ would express my meaning better .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 53]: Anxious to get the books arranged before they all left me , for I knew I should have but little heart for it after they were gone , I grudged Charley the forenoon he wanted amongst my papers , and prevailed upon him to go with me the next day as usual .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 43]: Another fortnight , which was almost the limit of their stay , would , I thought , suffice ; and giving up everything else , Charley and I worked from morning till night , with much though desultory assistance from the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 34]: I contrived to keep the carpenter and housemaid in work , and by the end of the week began to see the inroads of order ` scattering the rear of darkness thin . '
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 3]: MARY OSBORNE .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 14]: All this time the acquaintance between Mary Osborne and myself had not improved .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 18]: Save as the sister of my friend I had not , I repeat , found her interesting .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 14]: She did not seem at all to fulfil the promise of her childhood .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 34]: Hardly once did she address me ; and , when I spoke to her , would reply with a simple , dull directness which indicated nothing beyond the fact of the passing occasion .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 37]: Rightly or wrongly , I concluded that the more indulgence she cherished for Charley , the less she felt for his friend -- that to him she attributed the endlessly sad declension of her darling brother .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 42]: Once on her face I surprised a look of unutterable sorrow resting on Charley 's ; but the moment she saw that I observed her , the look died out , and her face stiffened into its usual dulness and negation .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 12]: On me she turned only the unenlightened disc of her soul .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 19]: Mrs Osborne , whom I seldom saw , behaved with much more kindness , though hardly more cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 46]: It was only that she allowed her bright indulgence for Charley to cast the shadow of his image over the faults of his friend ; and except by the sadness that dwelt in every line of her sweet face , she did not attract me .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 38]: I was ever aware of an inward judgment which I did not believe I deserved , and I would turn from her look with a sense of injury which greater love would have changed into keen pain .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 14]: Once , however , I did meet a look of sympathy from Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 37]: On the second Monday of the fortnight I was more anxious than ever to reach the end of my labours , and was in the court , accompanied by Charley , as early as eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 17]: From the hall a dark passage led past the door of the dining-room to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 32]: Through the dark tube of the passage we saw the bright green of a lovely bit of sward , and upon it Mary and Clara , radiant in white morning dresses .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 4]: We joined them .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 7]: ` Here come the slave-drivers ! '
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 3]: remarked Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 4]: ` Already ! '
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 20]: said Mary , in a low voice , which I thought had a tinge of dismay in its tone .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 24]: ` Never mind , Polly , ' said her companion -- ` we 're not going to bow to their will and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 11]: We 'll have our walk in spite of them . '
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 46]: As she spoke she threw a glance at us which seemed to say -- ` You may come if you like ; ' then turned to Mary with another which said -- ` We shall see whether they prefer old books or young ladies . '
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 7]: Charley looked at me -- interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 13]: ` Do as you like , Charley , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 11]: I will do as you do , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 17]: ` Well , ' I said , ' I have no right -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 3]: bother ! '
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 12]: ` You 're so magnificent always with your rights and wrongs !
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 10]: Are you coming , or are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 25]: ` Yes , I 'm coming , ' I replied , convicted by Clara 's directness , for I was quite ready to go .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 32]: We crossed the court , and strolled through the park , which was of great extent , in the direction of a thick wood , covering a rise towards the east .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 53]: The morning air was perfectly still ; there was a little dew on the grass , which shone rather than sparkled ; the sun was burning through a light fog , which grew deeper as we approached the wood ; the decaying leaves filled the air with their sweet , mournful scent .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 35]: Through the wood went a wide opening or glade , stretching straight and far towards the east , and along this we walked , with that exhilaration which the fading Autumn so strangely bestows .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 33]: For some distance the ground ascended softly , but the view was finally closed in by a more abrupt swell , over the brow of which the mist hung in dazzling brightness .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 18]: Notwithstanding the gaiety of animal spirits produced by the season , I felt unusually depressed that morning .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 33]: Already , I believe , I was beginning to feel the home-born sadness of the soul whose wings are weary and whose foot can find no firm soil on which to rest .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 14]: Sometimes I think the wonder is that so many men are never sad .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 46]: I doubt if Charley would have suffered so but for the wrongs his father 's selfish religion had done him ; which perhaps were therefore so far well , inasmuch as otherwise he might not have cared enough about religion even to doubt concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 33]: But in my case now , it may have been only the unsatisfying presence of Clara , haunted by a dim regret that I could not love her more than I did .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 47]: For with regard to her my soul was like one who in a dream of delight sees outspread before him a wide river , wherein he makes haste to plunge that he may disport himself in the fine element ; but , wading eagerly , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 10]: finds not a single pool deeper than his knees .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 11]: ` What 's the matter with you , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 18]: said Charley , who , in the midst of some gay talk , suddenly perceived my silence .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 14]: ` You seem to lose all your spirits away from your precious library .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 17]: I do believe you grudge every moment not spent upon those ragged old books . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 20]: I was n't thinking of that , Charley ; I was wondering what lies beyond that mist . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 3]: I see !
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 11]: -- A chapter of the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ !
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 18]: Here we are -- Mary , you 're Christiana , and , Clara , you 're Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 7]: Wilfrid , you 're -- what ?
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 25]: -- I should have said Hopeful any other day , but this morning you look like -- let me see -- like Mr Ready-to-Halt .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 16]: The celestial city lies behind that fog -- does n't it , Christiana ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 22]: I do n't like to hear you talk so , Charley , ' said his sister , smiling in his face .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 12]: ` They ai n't in the Bible , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 41]: ` No -- and I should n't mind if you were only merry , but you know you are scoffing at the story , and I love it -- so I ca n't be pleased to hear you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 31]: I beg your pardon , Mary -- but your celestial city lies behind such a fog that not one crystal turret , one pearly gate of it was ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 45]: At least _ we _ have never caught a glimmer of it , and must go tramp , tramp -- we do n't know whither , any more than the blind puppy that has crawled too far from his mother 's side . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 32]: I do see the light of it , Charley dear , ' said Mary , sadly -- not as if the light were any great comfort to her at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 18]: ` If you do see something -- how can you tell what it 's the light of ?
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 16]: It may come from the city of Dis , for anything you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 9]: I do n't know what that is . '
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 7]: the red-hot city -- down below .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 10]: You will find all about it in Dante . '
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 19]: ` It does n't look like that -- the light I see , ' said Mary , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 16]: ` How very ill-bred you are -- to say such wicked things , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 4]: ` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 7]: They _ are _ better unmentioned .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 11]: Let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die !
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 10]: Only do n't allude to the unpleasant subject . '
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 16]: He burst out singing : the verses were poor , but I will give them .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 6]: ` Let the sun shimmer !
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 5]: Let the wind blow !
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 10]: All is a notion -- What do we know ?
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 5]: Let the moon glimmer !
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 5]: Let the stream flow !
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 8]: All is but motion To and fro !
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 6]: ` Let the rose wither !
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 5]: Let the stars glow !
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 10]: Let the rain batter -- Drift sleet and snow !
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 5]: Bring the tears hither !
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 5]: Let the smiles go !
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 5]: What does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 4]: To and fro !
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 10]: ` To and fro ever , Motion and show !
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 8]: Nothing goes onward -- Hurry or no !
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 16]: All is one river -- Seaward and so Up again sunward -- To and fro !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 9]: ` Pendulum sweeping High , and now low !
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 10]: That star -- _ tic _ , blot it !
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 8]: _ Tac _ , let it go !
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 17]: Time he is reaping Hay for his mow ; That flower -- he 's got it !
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 4]: To and fro !
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 10]: ` Such a scythe swinging , Mighty and slow !
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 8]: Ripping and slaying -- Hey nonny no !
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 11]: Black Ribs is singing -- Chorus -- Hey , ho !
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 9]: What is he saying -- To and fro ?
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 11]: ` Singing and saying `` Grass is hay -- ho !
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 10]: Love is a longing ; Water is snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 9]: Swinging and swaying , Toll the bells go !
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 8]: Dinging and donging To and fro ! '
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 6]: ` Oh , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 15]: said his sister , with suppressed agony , ` what a wicked song ! '
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 13]: ` It _ is _ a wicked song , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 16]: ` But I meant -- it only represents an unbelieving , hopeless mood . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 9]: _ You _ wrote it , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 17]: she said , giving me -- as it seemed , involuntarily -- a look of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 24]: ` Yes , I did ; but -- ' ` Then I think you are very horrid , ' said Clara , interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 4]: ` Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 17]: I said , ` you must not leave your sister to think so badly of me !
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 14]: You know why I wrote it -- and what I meant . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 13]: I wish I had written it myself , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 5]: I think it splendid .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 8]: Anybody might envy you that song . '
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 15]: ` But you know I did n't mean it for a true one . '
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 12]: ` Who knows whether it is true or false ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 17]: _ I _ know , ' said Mary : ' I know it is false . '
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 12]: ` And _ I _ hope it , ' I adjoined .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 13]: ` Whatever put such horrid things into your head , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 3]: asked Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 10]: ` Probably the fear lest they should be true .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 17]: The verses came as I sat in a country church once , not long ago . '
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 6]: ` In a church ! '
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 3]: exclaimed Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 15]: he does go to church sometimes , ' said Charley , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 11]: ` How could you think of it in church ? '
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 3]: persisted Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 12]: ` It 's more like the churchyard , ' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 18]: ` It was in an old church in a certain desolate sea-forsaken town , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 41]: ` The pendulum of the clock -- a huge , long , heavy , slow thing -- hangs far down into the church , and goes swing , swang over your head , three or four seconds to every swing .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 34]: When you have heard the _ tic _ , your heart grows faint every time between -- waiting for the _ tac _ , which seems as if it would never come . '
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 17]: We were ascending the acclivity , and no one spoke again before we reached the top .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 9]: There a wide landscape lay stretched before us .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 25]: The mist was rapidly melting away before the gathering strength of the sun : as we stood and gazed we could see it vanishing .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 14]: By slow degrees the colours of the Autumn woods dawned out of it .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 42]: Close under us lay a great wave of gorgeous red -- beeches , I think -- in the midst of which , here and there , stood up , tall and straight and dark , the unchanging green of a fir-tree .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 22]: The glow of a hectic death was over the landscape , melting away into the misty fringe of the far horizon .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 20]: Overhead the sky was blue , with a clear thin blue that told of withdrawing suns and coming frosts .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 23]: ` For my part , ' I said , ' I can not believe that beyond this loveliness there lies no greater .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 22]: Who knows , Charley , but death may be the first recognizable step of the progress of which you despair ? '
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 27]: It was then I caught the look from Mary 's eye , for the sake of which I have recorded the little incidents of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 20]: But the same moment the look faded , and the veil or the mask fell over her face . '
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 25]: I am afraid , ' she said , ` if there has been no progress before , there will be little indeed after . '
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 30]: Now of all things , I hated the dogmatic theology of the party in which she had been brought up , and I turned from her with silent dislike .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 17]: ` Really , ' said Clara , ` you gentlemen have been very entertaining this morning .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 21]: One would think Polly and I had come out for a stroll with a couple of undertaker 's - men .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 12]: There 's surely time enough to think of such things yet !
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 12]: None of us are at death 's door exactly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 5]: `` Sweet remembrancer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 5]: -- Who knows ? '
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 4]: said Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 52]: `` Now I , to comfort him , '' ' I followed , quoting Mrs Quickly concerning Sir John Falstaff , ' `` bid him , ' a should not think of God : I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet . '' ' '
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 22]: I beg your pardon , ' said Mary -- ` there was no word of Him in the matter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 16]: I see , ' said Clara : ` you meant that at me , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 9]: But I assure you I am no heathen .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 22]: I go to church regularly -- once a Sunday when I can , and twice when I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 14]: That 's more than you do , Mr Cumbermede , I suspect . '
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 8]: ` What makes you think so ? '
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 13]: I ca n't imagine you enjoying anything but the burial service . '
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 17]: ` It is to my mind the most consoling of them all , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 19]: ` Well , I have n't reached the point of wanting that consolation yet , thank heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 25]: ` Perhaps some of us would rather have the consolation than give thanks that we did n't need it , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 16]: I ca n't say I understand you , but I know you mean something disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 13]: Polly , I think we had better go home to breakfast . '
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 8]: Mary turned , and we all followed .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 8]: Little was said on the way home .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 17]: We divided in the hall -- the ladies to breakfast , and we to our work .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 14]: We had not spoken for an hour , when Charley broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 10]: ` What a brute I am , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 12]: ` Why should n't I be as good as Jesus Christ ?
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 9]: It seems always as if a man might .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 6]: But just look at me !
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 22]: Because I was miserable myself , I went and made my poor little sister twice as miserable as she was before .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 12]: She 'll never get over what I said this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 12]: ` It _ was _ foolish of you , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 5]: ` It was brutal .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 16]: I am the most selfish creature in the world -- always taken up with myself .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 11]: I do believe there is a devil , after all .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 9]: _ I _ am _ a _ devil .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 10]: And the universal self is _ the _ devil .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 21]: If there were such a thing as a self always giving itself away -- that self would be God . '
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 13]: ` Something very like the God of Christianity , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 14]: ` If it were so , there would be a chance for us .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 15]: We might then one day give the finishing blow to the devil in us .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 14]: But no : _ he _ does all for his own glory . '
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 9]: ` It depends on what his glory is .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 23]: If what the self-seeking self would call glory , then I agree with you -- that is not the God we need .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 27]: But if his glory should be just the opposite -- the perfect giving of himself away -- then -- Of course I know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 10]: My uncle used to say things like that . '
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 13]: He did not reply , and we went on with our work .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 11]: Neither of the ladies came near us again that day .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 42]: Before the end of the week the library was in tolerable order to the eye , though it could not be perfectly arranged until the commencement of a catalogue should be as the dawn of a consciousness in the half-restored mass .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 3]: A STORM .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 31]: So many books of rarity and value had revealed themselves , that it was not difficult to make Sir Giles comprehend in some degree the importance of such a possession .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 77]: He had grown more and more interested as the work went on ; and even Lady Brotherton , although she much desired to have , at least , the oldest and most valuable of the books re-bound in red morocco first , was so far satisfied with what she was told concerning the worth of the library , that she determined to invite some of the neighbours to dinner , for the sake of showing it .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 32]: The main access to it was to be by the armoury ; and she had that side of the gallery round the hall which led thither covered with a thick carpet .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 32]: Meantime Charley had looked over all the papers in my chest , but , beyond what I have already stated , no fact of special interest had been brought to light .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 39]: In sending an invitation to Charley , Lady Brotherton could hardly avoid sending me one as well : I doubt whether I should otherwise have been allowed to enjoy the admiration bestowed on the result of my labours .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 28]: The dinner was formal and dreary enough : the geniality of one of the heads of a household is seldom sufficient to give character to an entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 33]: ` They tell me you are a buyer of books , Mr Alderforge , ' said Mr Mellon to the clergyman of a neighbouring parish , as we sat over our wine .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 11]: ` Quite a mistake , ' returned Mr Alderforge . '
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 8]: I am a reader of books . '
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 5]: ` That of course !
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 11]: But you buy them first -- do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 4]: ` Not always .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 6]: I sometimes borrow them . '
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 6]: ` That I never do .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 13]: If a book is worth borrowing , it is worth buying . '
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 9]: ` Perhaps -- if you can afford it .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 20]: But many books that book-buyers value I count worthless -- for all their wide margins and uncut leaves . '
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 14]: ` Will you come-and have a look at Sir Giles 's library ? '
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 6]: I ventured to say . '
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 19]: I never heard of a library at Moldwarp Hall , Sir Giles , ' said Mr Mellon . '
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 18]: I am given to understand there is a very valuable one , ' said Mr Alderforge . '
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 28]: I shall be glad to accompany you , sir , ' he added , turning to me , ' -- if Sir Giles will allow us . '
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 18]: ` You can not have a better guide than Mr Cumbermede , ' said Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 19]: I am indebted to him almost for the discovery -- altogether for the restoration of the library . '
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 17]: ` Assisted by Miss Brotherton and her friends , Sir Giles , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 13]: A son of Mr Cumbermede of Lowdon Farm , I presume ? '
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 7]: said Alderforge , bowing interrogatively . '
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 7]: A nephew , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 8]: ` He was a most worthy man .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 21]: -- By the way , Sir Giles , your young friend here must be a distant connection of your own .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 28]: I found in some book or other lately , I forget where at the moment , that there were Cumbermedes at one time in Moldwarp Hall . '
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 12]: ` Yes -- about two hundred years ago , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 32]: It passed to our branch of the family some time during the troubles of the seventeenth century -- I hardly know how -- I am not much of an historian . '
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 14]: I thought of my precious volume , and the name on the title-page .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 12]: That book might have been in the library of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 24]: If so , how had it strayed into my possession -- alone , yet more to me than all that was left behind ?
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 7]: We betook ourselves to the library .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 31]: The visitors expressed themselves astonished at its extent , and the wealth which even a glance revealed -- for I took care to guide their notice to its richest veins .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 59]: ` When it is once arranged , ' I said , ' I fancy there will be few private libraries to stand a comparison with it -- I am thinking of old English literature , and old editions : there is not a single volume of the present century in it , so far as I know . '
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 25]: I had had a few old sconces fixed here and there , but as yet there were no means of really lighting the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 32]: Hence , when a great flash of lightning broke from a cloud that hung over the park right in front of the windows , it flooded them with a dazzling splendour .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 19]: I went to find Charley , for the library was the best place to see the lightning from .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 39]: As I entered the drawing-room , a tremendous peal of thunder burst over the house , causing so much consternation amongst the ladies , that , for the sake of company , they all followed to the library .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 7]: Clara seemed more frightened than any .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 5]: Mary was perfectly calm .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 5]: Charley was much excited .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 6]: The storm grew in violence .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 18]: We saw the lightning strike a tree which stood alone a few hundred yards from the house .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 14]: When the next flash came , half of one side seemed torn away .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 21]: The wind rose , first in fierce gusts , then into a tempest , and the rain poured in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 16]: ` None of you can go home to-night , ladies , ' said Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 13]: ` You must make up your minds to stop where you are .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 11]: Few horses would face such a storm as that . '
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 20]: ` It would be to tax your hospitality too grievously , Sir Giles , ' said Mr Alderforge . '
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 22]: I dare say it will clear up by-and-by , or at least moderate sufficiently to let us get home . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 16]: I do n't think there 's much chance of that , ' returned Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 13]: ` The barometer has been steadily falling for the last three days .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 13]: My dear , you had better give your orders at once . '
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 13]: ` You had better stop , Charley , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 11]: I wo n't if you go , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 4]: Clara was beside .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 12]: ` You must not think of going , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 50]: Whether she spoke to him or me I did not know , but as Charley made no answer -- ' I can not stop without being asked , ' I said , ` and it is not likely that any one will take the trouble to ask me . '
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 4]: The storm increased .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 21]: At the request of the ladies , the gentlemen left the library and accompanied them to the drawing-room for tea .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 15]: Our hostess asked Clara to sing , but she was too frightened to comply .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 21]: ` You will sing , Mary , if Lady Brotherton asks you , I know , ' said Mrs Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 17]: ` Do , my dear , ' said Lady Brotherton ; and Mary at once complied .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 13]: I had never heard her sing , and did not expect much .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 27]: But although she had little execution , there was , I found , a wonderful charm both in her voice and the simplicity of her mode .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 36]: I did not feel this at first , nor could I tell when the song began to lay hold upon me , but when it ceased , I found that I had been listening intently .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 19]: I have often since tried to recall it , but as yet it has eluded all my efforts .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 44]: I still cherish the hope that it may return some night in a dream , or in some waking moment of quiescent thought , when what we call the brain works as it were of itself , and the spirit allows it play .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 15]: The close was lost in a louder peal of thunder than had yet burst .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 15]: Charley and I went again to the library to look out on the night .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 20]: It was dark as pitch , except when the lightning broke and revealed everything for one intense moment . '
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 33]: I think sometimes , ' said Charley , ` that death will be like one of those flashes , revealing everything in hideous fact -- for just one-moment and no more . '
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 12]: ` How for one moment and no more , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 42]: ` Because the sight of the truth concerning itself must kill the soul , if there be one , with disgust at its own vileness , and the miserable contrast between its aspirations and attainments , its pretences and its efforts .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 22]: At least , that would be the death fit for a life like mine -- a death of disgust at itself .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 60]: We claim immortality ; we cringe and cower with the fear that immortality may _ not _ be the destiny of man ; and yet we -- _ I _ -- do things unworthy not merely of immortality , but unworthy of the butterfly existence of a single day in such a world as this sometimes seems to be .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 22]: Just think how I stabbed at my sister 's faith this morning -- careless of making her as miserable as myself !
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 34]: Because my father has put into her mind his fancies , and I hate them , I wound again the heart which they wound , and which can not help their presence ! '
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 31]: ` But the heart that can be sorry for an action is far above the action , just as her heart is better than the notions that haunt it . '
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 6]: ` Sometimes I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 5]: But action determines character .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 8]: And it is all such a muddle !
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 11]: I do n't care much about what they call immortality .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 9]: I doubt if it is worth the having .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 32]: I would a thousand times rather have one day of conscious purity of heart and mind and soul and body , than an eternity of such life as I have now .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 7]: -- What am I saying ? '
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 8]: he added , with a despairing laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 27]: ` It is a fool 's comparison ; for an eternity of the former would be bliss -- one moment of the latter is misery . '
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 13]: I could but admire and pity my poor friend both at once .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 6]: Miss Pease had entered unheard .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 21]: ` Mr Cumbermede , ' she said , ' I have been looking for you to show you your room .
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 36]: It is not the one I should like to have got for you , but Mrs Wilson says you have occupied it before , and I dare say you will find it comfortable enough . '
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 7]: ` Thank you , Miss Pease .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 10]: I am sorry you should have taken the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 7]: I can go home well enough .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 11]: I am not afraid of a little rain . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 5]: A little rain ! '
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 8]: said Charley , trying to speak lightly .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 12]: ` Well , any amount of rain , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 6]: ` But the lightning ! '
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 9]: expostulated Miss Pease in a timid voice . '
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 15]: I am something of a fatalist , Miss Pease , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 11]: `` Every bullet has its billet , '' you know .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 22]: Besides , if I had a choice , I think I would rather die by lightning than any other way . '
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 10]: ` Do n't talk like that , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 3]: -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 6]: what a flash ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 14]: I was not speaking irreverently , I assure you , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 23]: -- ' I think I had better set out at once , for there seems no chance of its clearing . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 13]: I am sure Sir Giles would be distressed if you did . '
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 13]: ` He will never know , and I dislike giving trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 6]: ` The room is ready .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 17]: I will show you where it is , that you may go when you like . '
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 22]: ` If Mrs Wilson says it is a room I have occupied before , I know the way quite well . '
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 12]: ` There are two ways to it , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 17]: ` But of course one of them is enough , ' she added with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 14]: ` Mr Osborne , your room is in another part quite . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 13]: I know where my sister 's room is , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 8]: ` Is it anywhere near hers ? '
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 10]: ` That is the room you are to have .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 12]: Miss Osborne is to be with your mamma , I think .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 13]: There is plenty of accommodation , only the notice was short . '
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 7]: I began to button my coat .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 11]: ` Do n't go , Wilfrid , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 6]: ` You might give offence .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 21]: Besides , you will have the advantage of getting to work as early as you please in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 31]: It was late and I was tired -- consequently less inclined than usual to encounter a storm , for in general I enjoyed being in any commotion of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 32]: Also I felt I should like to pass another night in that room , and have besides the opportunity of once more examining at my leisure the gap in the tapestry .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 13]: ` Will you meet me early in the library , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 16]: ` Yes -- to be sure I will -- as early as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 11]: ` Let us go to the drawing-room , then . '
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 18]: ` Why should you , if you are tired , and want to go to bed ? '
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 14]: ` Because Lady Brotherton will not like my being included in the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 13]: She will think it absurd of me not to go home . '
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 14]: ` There is no occasion to go near her , then . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 17]: I do not choose to sleep in the house without knowing that she knows it . '
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 3]: We went .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 8]: I made my way to Lady Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 7]: Clara was standing near her . '
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 15]: I am much obliged by your hospitality , Lady Brotherton , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 14]: ` It is rather a rough night to encounter in evening dress . '
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 3]: She bowed .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 25]: ` The distance is not great , however , ' I said , ` and perhaps -- ' ` Out of the question ! '
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 11]: said Sir Giles , who came up at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 19]: Will you see , then , Sir Giles , that a room is prepared for your guest ? '
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 4]: she said . '
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 11]: I trust that is unnecessary , ' he replied . '
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 5]: I gave orders . '
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 11]: -- But as he spoke he went towards the bell .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 16]: ` It is all arranged , I believe , Sir Giles , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 12]: ` Mrs Wilson has already informed me which is my room .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 6]: Good-night , Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 7]: He shook hands with me kindly .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 8]: I bowed to Lady Brotherton and retired .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 35]: It may seem foolish to record such mere froth of conversation , but I want my reader to understand how a part , at least , of the family of Moldwarp Hall regarded me .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 3]: CHAPTER XL .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 3]: A DREAM .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 6]: My room looked dreary enough .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 24]: There was no fire , and the loss of the patch of tapestry from the wall gave the whole an air of dilapidation .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 31]: The wind howled fearfully in the chimney and about the door on the roof , and the rain came down on the leads like the distant trampling of many horses .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 9]: But I was not in an imaginative mood .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 6]: Charley was again my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 10]: I could not bear him to be so miserable .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 9]: Why was I not as miserable as he ?
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 4]: I asked myself .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 23]: Perhaps I ought to be , for although certainly I hoped more , I could not say I believed more than he .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 37]: I wished more than ever that I did believe , for then I should be able to help him -- I was sure of that ; but I saw no possible way of arriving at belief .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 5]: Where was the proof ?
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 9]: Where even the hope of a growing probability ?
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 70]: With these thoughts drifting about in my brain , like waifs which the tide will not let go , I was poring over the mutilated forms of the tapestry round the denuded door , with an expectation , almost a conviction , that I should find the fragment still hanging on the wall of the kitchen at the Moat , the very piece wanted to complete the broken figures .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 56]: When I had them well fixed in my memory , I went to bed , and lay pondering over the several broken links which indicated some former connection between the Moat and the Hall , until I fell asleep , and began to dream strange wild dreams , of which the following was the last .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 17]: I was in a great palace , wandering hither and thither , and meeting no one .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 9]: A weight of silence brooded in the place .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 19]: From hall to hall I went , along corridor and gallery , and up and down endless stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 44]: I knew that in some room near me was one whose name was Athanasia , -- a maiden , I thought in my dream , whom I had known and loved for years , but had lately lost -- I knew not how .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 12]: Somewhere here she was , if only I could find her !
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 9]: From room to room I went seeking her .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 20]: Every room I entered bore some proof that she had just been there -- but there she was not .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 47]: In one lay a veil , in another a handkerchief , in a third a glove ; and all were scented with a strange entrancing odour , which I had never known before , but which in certain moods I can to this day imperfectly recall .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 17]: I followed and followed until hope failed me utterly , and I sat down and wept .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 32]: But while I wept , hope dawned afresh , and I rose and again followed the quest , until I found myself in a little chapel like that of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 32]: It was filled with the sound of an organ , distance-faint , and the thin music was the same as the odour of the handkerchief which I carried in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 26]: I tried to follow the sound , but the chapel grew and grew as I wandered , and I came no nearer to its source .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 27]: At last the altar rose before me on my left , and through the bowed end of the aisle I passed behind it into the lady-chapel .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 11]: There against the outer wall stood a dusky ill-defined shape .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 20]: Its head rose above the sill of the eastern window , and I saw it against the rising moon .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 28]: But that and the whole figure were covered with a thick drapery ; I could see nothing of the face , and distinguish little of the form .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 6]: ` What art thou ? '
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 5]: I asked trembling . '
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 11]: I am Death -- dost thou not know me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 13]: answered the figure , in a sweet though worn and weary voice .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 17]: ` Thou hast been following me all thy life , and hast followed me hither . '
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 38]: Then I saw through the lower folds of the cloudy garment , which grew thin and gauze-like as I gazed , a huge iron door , with folding leaves , and a great iron bar across them .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 9]: ` Art thou at thine own door ? '
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 16]: ` Surely thy house can not open under the eastern window of the church ? '
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 10]: ` Follow and see , ' answered the figure .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 17]: Turning , it drew back the bolt , threw wide the portals , and low-stooping entered .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 17]: I followed , not into the moonlit night , but through a cavernous opening into darkness .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 23]: If my Athanasia were down with Death , I would go with Death , that I might at least end with her .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 32]: Down and down I followed the veiled figure , down flight after flight of stony stairs , through passages like those of the catacombs , and again down steep straight stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 28]: At length it stopped at another gate , and with beating heart I heard what I took for bony fingers fumbling with a chain and a bolt .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 20]: But ere the fastenings had yielded , once more I heard the sweet odour-like music of the distant organ .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 24]: The same moment the door opened , but I could see nothing for some time for the mighty inburst of a lovely light .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 61]: A fair river , brimming full , its little waves flashing in the sun and wind , washed the threshold of the door , and over its surface , hither and thither , sped the white sails of shining boats , while from somewhere , clear now , but still afar , came the sound of a great organ psalm .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 19]: Beyond the river the sun was rising -- over blue Summer hills that melted into blue Summer sky .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 21]: On the threshold stood my guide , bending towards me , as if waiting for me to pass out also .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 16]: I lifted my eyes : the veil had fallen -- it was my lost Athanasia !
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 21]: Not one beam touched her face , for her back was to the sun , yet her face was radiant .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 44]: Trembling , I would have kneeled at her feet , but she stepped out upon the flowing river , and with the sweetest of sad smiles , drew the door to , and left me alone in the dark hollow of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 10]: I broke into a convulsive weeping , and awoke .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLI .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 3]: A WAKING .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 17]: I suppose I awoke tossing in my misery , for my hand fell upon something cold .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 8]: I started up and tried to see .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 28]: The light of a clear morning of late Autumn had stolen into the room while I slept , and glimmered on something that lay upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 30]: It was some time before I could believe that my troubled eyes were not the sport of one of those odd illusions that come of mingled sleep and waking .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 27]: But by the golden hilt and rusted blade I was at length convinced , although the scabbard was gone , that I saw my own sword .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 14]: It lay by my left side , with the hilt towards my hand .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 52]: But the moment I turned a little to take it in my right hand , I forgot all about it in a far more bewildering discovery , which fixed me staring half in terror , half in amazement , so that again for a moment I disbelieved in my waking condition .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 12]: On the other pillow lay the face of a lovely girl .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 23]: I felt as if I had seen it before -- whether only in the just vanished dream , I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 27]: But the maiden of my dream never comes back to me with any other features or with any other expression than those which I now beheld .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 14]: There was an ineffable mingling of love and sorrow on the sweet countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 20]: The girl was dead asleep , but evidently dreaming , for tears were flowing from under her closed lids .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 20]: For a time I was unable even to think ; when thought returned , I was afraid to move .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 26]: All at once the face of Mary Osborne dawned out of the vision before me -- how different , how glorified from its waking condition !
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 13]: It was perfectly lovely -- transfigured by the unchecked outflow of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 10]: The recognition brought me to my senses at once .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 25]: I did not waste a single thought in speculating how the mistake had occurred , for there was not a moment to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 33]: I must be wise to shield her , and chiefly , as much as might be , from the miserable confusion which her own discovery of the untoward fact would occasion her .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 47]: At first I thought it would be best to lie perfectly still , in order that she , at length awaking and discovering where she was , but finding me fast asleep , might escape with the conviction that the whole occurrence remained her own secret .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 53]: I made the attempt , but I need hardly say that never before or since have I found myself in a situation half so perplexing ; and in a few moments I was seized with such a trembling that I was compelled to turn my thoughts to the only other possible plan .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 16]: As I reflected , the absolute necessity of attempting it became more and more apparent .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 49]: In the first place , when she woke and saw me , she might scream and be heard ; in the next , she might be seen as she left the room , or , unable to find her way , might be involved in great consequent embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 58]: But , if I could gather all my belongings , and , without awaking her , escape by the stair to the roof , she would be left to suppose that she had but mistaken her chamber , and would , I hoped , remain in ignorance that she had not passed the night in it alone .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 9]: I dared one more peep into her face .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 40]: The light and the loveliness of her dream had passed ; I should not now have had to look twice to know that it was Mary Osborne ; but never more could I see in hers a common face .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 22]: She was still fast asleep , and , stealthy as a beast of prey , I began to make my escape .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 46]: At the first movement , however , my perplexity was redoubled , for again my hand fell on the sword which I had forgotten , and question after question as to how they were together , and together there , darted through my bewildered brain .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 13]: Could a third person have come and laid the sword between us ?
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 15]: I had no time , however , to answer one of my own questions .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 54]: Hardly knowing which was better , or if there was _ a better _ , I concluded to take the weapon with me , moved in part by the fact that I had found it where I had lost it , but influenced far more by its association with this night of marvel .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 54]: Having gathered my garments together , and twice glanced around me -- once to see that I left nothing behind , and once to take farewell of the peaceful face , which had never moved , I opened the little door in the wall , and made my strange retreat up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 70]: My heart was beating so violently from the fear of her waking , that , when the door was drawn to behind me , I had to stand for what seemed minutes before I was able to ascend the steep stair , and step from its darkness into the clear frosty shine of the Autumn sun , brilliant upon the leads wet with the torrents of the preceding night .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 47]: I found a sheltered spot by the chimney-stack , where no one could see me from below , and proceeded to dress myself -- assisted in my very imperfect toilet by the welcome discovery of a pool of rain in a depression of the lead-covered roof .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 23]: But alas , before I had finished , I found that I had brought only one of my shoes away with me !
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 33]: This settled the question I was at the moment debating -- whether , namely , it would be better to go home , or to find some way of reaching the library .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 17]: I put my remaining shoe in my pocket , and set out to discover a descent .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 50]: It would have been easy to get down into the little gallery , but it communicated on both sides immediately with bed-rooms , which for anything I knew might be occupied ; and besides I was unwilling to enter the house for fear of encountering some of the domestics .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 55]: But I knew more of the place now , and had often speculated concerning the odd position and construction of an outside stair in the first court , close to the chapel , with its landing at the door of a room _ en suite _ with those of Sir Giles and Lady Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 12]: It was for a man an easy drop to this landing .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 60]: Quiet as a cat , I crept over the roof , let myself down , crossed the court swiftly , drew back the bolt which alone secured the wicket , and , with no greater mishap than the unavoidable wetting of shoeless feet , was soon safe in my own room , exchanging my evening for a morning dress .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 14]: When I looked at my watch , I found it nearly seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 30]: I was so excited and bewildered by the adventures I had gone through , that , from very commonness , all the things about me looked alien and strange .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 13]: I had no feeling of relation to the world of ordinary life .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 49]: The first thing I did was to hang my sword in its own old place , and the next to take down the bit of tapestry from the opposite wall , which I proceeded to examine in the light of my recollection of that round the denuded door .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 37]: Room was left for not even a single doubt as to the relation between this and that : they had been wrought in one and the same piece by fair fingers of some long vanished time .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLII .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 5]: A TALK ABOUT SUICIDE .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 30]: In the same excited mood , but repressing it with all the energy I could gather , I returned to the Hall and made my way to the library .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 6]: There Charley soon joined me .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 10]: ` Why did n't you come to breakfast ? '
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 16]: ` I 've been home , and changed my clothes , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 9]: I could n't well appear in a tail-coat .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 16]: It 's bad enough to have to wear such an ugly thing by candle-light . '
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 9]: ` What 's the matter with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 24]: he asked again , after an interval of silence , which I judge from the question must have been rather a long one .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 12]: ` What is the matter with me , Charley ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 5]: I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 8]: You do n't seem yourself somehow . '
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 23]: I do not know what answer I gave him , but I knew myself what was the matter with me well enough .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 42]: The form and face of the maiden of my dream , the Athanasia lost that she might be found , blending with the face and form of Mary Osborne , filled my imagination so that I could think of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 74]: Gladly would I have been rid of even Charley 's company , that , while my hands were busy with the books , my heart might brood at will now upon the lovely dream , now upon the lovely vision to which I awoke from it , and which , had it not glided into the forms of the foregone dream , and possessed it with itself , would have banished it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 23]: At length I was aware of light steps and sweet voices in the next room , and Mary and Clara presently entered .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 32]: How came it that the face of the one had lost the half of its radiance , and the face of the other had gathered all that the former had lost .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 82]: Mary 's countenance was as still as ever ; there was not in it a single ray of light beyond its usual expression ; but I had become more capable of reading it , for the coalescence of the face of my dream with her dreaming face had given me its key ; and I was now so far from indifferent , that I was afraid to look for fear of betraying the attraction I now found it exercise over me .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 27]: Seldom surely has a man been so long familiar with and careless of any countenance to find it all at once an object of absorbing interest !
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 25]: The very fact of its want of revelation added immensely to its power over me now -- for was I not in its secret ?
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 14]: Did I not know what a lovely soul hid behind that unexpressive countenance ?
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 58]: Did I not know that it was as the veil of the holy of holies , at times reflecting only the light of the seven golden lamps in the holy place ; at others almost melted away in the rush of the radiance unspeakable from the hidden and holier side -- the region whence come the revelations .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 29]: To draw through it , if but once , the feeblest glimmer of the light I had but once beheld , seemed an ambition worthy of a life .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 44]: Knowing her power of reticence , however , and of withdrawing from the outer courts into the penetralia of her sanctuary , guessing also at something of the aspect in which she regarded me , I dared not now make any such attempt .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 112]: But I resolved to seize what opportunity might offer of convincing her that I was not so far out of sympathy with her as to be unworthy of holding closer converse ; and I now began to feel distressed at what had given me little trouble before , namely , that she should suppose me the misleader of her brother , while I knew that , however far I might be from an absolute belief in things which she seemed never to have doubted , I was yet in some measure the means of keeping him from flinging aside the last cords which held him to the faith of his fathers .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 33]: But I would not lead in any such direction , partly from the fear of hypocrisy , partly from horror at the idea of making capital of what little faith I had .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 19]: But Charley himself afforded me an opportunity which I could not , whatever my scrupulosity , well avoid .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 13]: ` Have you ever looked into that little book , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 21]: I said , finding in my hands an early edition of the _ Christian Morals _ of Sir Thomas Browne .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 14]: -- I wanted to say something , that I might not appear distraught .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 17]: ` No , ' he answered , with indifference , as he glanced at the title-page .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 7]: ` Is it anything particular ? '
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 22]: ` Everything he writes , however whimsical in parts , is well worth more than mere reading , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 15]: ` It is a strangely latinized style , but has its charm notwithstanding . '
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 10]: He was turning over the leaves as I spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 8]: Receiving no response , I looked up .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 12]: He seemed to have come upon something which had attracted him .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 7]: ` What have you found ? '
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 21]: ` Here 's a chapter on the easiest way of putting a stop to it all , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 11]: ` He was a medical man -- was n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 12]: I 'm ashamed to say I know nothing about him . '
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 8]: ` Yes , certainly he was . '
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 10]: ` Then he knew what he was about . '
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 15]: ` As well probably as any man of his profession at the time . '
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 17]: ` He recommends drowning , ' said Charley , without raising his eyes from the book .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 8]: ` What do you mean ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 6]: I mean for suicide . '
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 12]: ` Nonsense , He was the last man to favour that .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 6]: You must make a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 9]: He was a thoroughly Christian man . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 6]: I know nothing about that .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 4]: Hear this . '
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 17]: He read the following passages from the beginning of the thirteenth section of the second part .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 30]: ` With what shifts and pains we come into the world , we remember not ; but 't is commonly found no easy matter to get out of it .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 22]: Many have studied to exasperate the ways of death , but fewer hours have been spent to soften that necessity . '
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 71]: -- ` Ovid , the old heroes , and the Stoicks , who were so afraid of drowning , as dreading thereby the extinction of their soul , which they conceived to be a fire , stood probably in fear of an easier way of death ; wherein the water , entering the possessions of air , makes a temporary suffocation , and kills as it were without a fever .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 22]: Surely many , who have had the spirit to destroy themselves , have not been ingenious in the contrivance thereof . '
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 38]: -- ` Cato is much to be pitied , who mangled himself with poniards ; and Hannibal seems more subtle , who carried his delivery , not in the point but the pummel of his sword . '
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 3]: ` Poison .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 13]: I suppose , ' he said , as he ended the extract .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 29]: ` Yes , that 's the story , if you remember , ' I answered ; ` but I do n't see that Sir Thomas is favouring suicide .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 18]: What he writes there is merely a speculation on the comparative ease of different modes of dying .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 6]: Let me see it . '
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 20]: I took the book from his hands , and , glancing over the essay , read the closing passage .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 17]: ` But to learn to die , is better than to study the ways of dying .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 66]: Death will find some ways to untie or cut the most gordian knots of life , and make men 's miseries as mortal as themselves : whereas evil spirits , as undying substances , are unseparable from their calamities ; and , therefore , they everlastingly struggle under their angustias , and , bound up with immortality , can never get out of themselves . '
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 6]: I told you so ! '
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 3]: cried Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 18]: He is the most cunning arguer -- beats Despair in the _ Fairy Queen _ hollow ! '
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 35]: By this time , either attracted by the stately flow of Sir Thomas 's speech , or by the tone of our disputation , the two girls had drawn nearer , and were listening .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 11]: ` What _ do _ you mean , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 18]: I said , perceiving , however , the hold I had by my further quotation given him .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 25]: ` First of all , he tells you the easiest way of dying , and then informs you that it ends all your troubles .
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 51]: He is too cunning to say in so many words that there is no hereafter , but what else can he wish you to understand when he says that in dying we have the advantage over the evil spirits , who can not by death get rid of their sufferings ?
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 20]: I will read this book , ' he added , closing it and putting it in his pocket . '
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 34]: I wish you would , ' I said : ` for although I confess you are logically right in your conclusions , I know Sir Thomas did not mean anything of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 16]: He was only misled by his love of antithesis into a hasty and illogical remark .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 12]: The whole tone of his book is against such a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 26]: Besides , I do not doubt he was thinking only of good people , for whom he believed all suffering over at their death . '
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 28]: ` But I do n't see , supposing he does believe in immortality , why you should be so anxious about his orthodoxy on the other point .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 25]: Did n't Dr Donne , as good a man as any , I presume , argue on the part of the suicide ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 22]: I have not read Dr Donne 's essay , but I suspect the obliquity of it has been much exaggerated . '
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 5]: ` Why should you ?
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 13]: I never saw any argument worth the name on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 14]: We have plenty of expressions of horror -- but those are not argument .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 53]: Indeed , the mass of the vulgar are so afraid of dying that , apparently in terror lest suicide should prove infectious , they treat in a brutal manner the remains of the man who has only had the courage to free himself from a burden too hard for him to bear .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 8]: It is all selfishness -- nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 30]: They love their paltry selves so much that they count it a greater sin to kill oneself than to kill another man -- which seems to me absolutely devilish .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 28]: Therefore , the _ vox populi _ , whether it be the _ vox Dei _ or not , is not nonsense merely , but absolute wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 9]: Why should n't a man kill himself ? '
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 17]: Clara was looking on rather than listening , and her interest seemed that of amusement only .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 32]: Mary 's eyes were wide-fixed on the face of Charley , evidently tortured to find that to the other enormities of his unbelief was to be added the justification of suicide .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 44]: His habit of arguing was doubtless well enough known to her to leave room for the mitigating possibility that he might be arguing only for argument 's sake , but what he said could not but be shocking to her upon any supposition .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 8]: I was not ready with an answer .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 7]: Clara was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 13]: ` It 's a cowardly thing , anyhow , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 12]: ` How do you make that out , Miss Clara ? '
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 3]: asked Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 19]: ` I 'm aware it 's the general opinion , but I do n't see it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 13]: ` It 's surely cowardly to run away in that fashion . '
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 43]: ` For my part , ' returned Charley , ' I feel that it requires more courage than _ I _ 've got , and hence it comes , I suppose , that I admire any one who has the pluck . '
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 11]: ` What vulgar words you use , Mr Charles ! '
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 43]: ` Besides , ' he went on , heedless of her remark , ' a man may want to escape -- not from his duties -- he may n't know what they are -- but from his own weakness and shame . '
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 42]: ` But , Charley dear , ' said Mary , with a great light in her eyes , and the rest of her face as still as a sunless pond , ` you do n't think of the sin of it .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 19]: I know you are only talking , but some things ought n't to be talked of lightly . '
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 7]: ` What makes it a sin ?
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 13]: It 's not mentioned in the ten commandments , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 14]: ` Surely it 's against the will of God , Charley dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 11]: ` He has n't said anything about it , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 32]: And why should I have a thing forced upon me whether I will or not , and then be pulled up for throwing it away when I found it troublesome ? '
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 12]: ` Surely I do n't quite understand you , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 23]: ` Well , if I must be more explicit -- I was never asked whether I chose to be made or not .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 9]: I never had the conditions laid before me .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 24]: Here I am , and I ca n't help myself -- so far , I mean , as that here I am . '
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 21]: ` But life is a good thing , ' said Mary , evidently struggling with an almost overpowering horror . '
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 6]: I do n't know that .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 22]: My impression is that if I had been asked -- ' ` But that could n't be , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 7]: ` Then it was n't fair .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 34]: Bat why could n't I be made for a moment or two , long enough to have the thing laid before me , and be asked whether I would accept it or not ?
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 24]: My impression is that I would have said -- No , thank you ; that is , if it was fairly put . '
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 20]: I hastened to offer a remark , in the hope of softening the pain such flippancy must cause her .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 45]: ` And my impression is , Charley , ' I said , ` that if such had been possible -- ' ` Of course , ' he interrupted , ` the God you believe in could have made me for a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 14]: He can , I suppose , unmake me now when he likes . '
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 23]: ` Yes ; but could he have made you all at once capable of understanding his plans , and your own future ?
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 24]: Perhaps that is what he is doing now -- making you , by all you are going through , capable of understanding them .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 30]: Certainly the question could not have been put to you before you were able to comprehend it , and this may be the only way to make you able .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 72]: Surely a being who _ could _ make you had a right to risk the chance , if I may be allowed such an expression , of your being satisfied in the end with what he saw to be good -- so good indeed that , if we accept the New Testament story , he would have been willing to go through the same troubles himself for the same end . '
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 14]: ` No , no ; not the same troubles , ' he objected .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 39]: ` According to the story to which you refer , Jesus Christ was free from all that alone makes life unendurable -- the bad inside you , that will come outside whether you will or not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 5]: I admit your objection .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 24]: As to the evil coming out , I suspect it is better it should come out , so long as it is there .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 45]: But the end is not yet ; and still I insist the probability is that , if you could know it all now , you would say with submission , if not with hearty concurrence -- `` Thy will be done . '' ' '
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 21]: I have known people who could say that without knowing it all now , Mr Cumbermede , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 18]: I had often called her by her Christian name , but she had never accepted the familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 20]: ` No doubt , ' said Charley , ` but _ I _ 'm not one of those . '
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 32]: ` If you would but give in , ' said his sister , ` you would -- in the end , I mean -- say , `` It is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 7]: I am sure of that . '
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 36]: ` Yes -- perhaps I might -- after all the suffering had been forced upon me , and was over at last -- when I had been thoroughly exhausted and cowed , that is . '
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 19]: ` Which would n't satisfy any thinking soul , Charley -- much less God , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 18]: ` But if there be a God at all -- ' Mary gave a slight inarticulate cry .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 18]: ` Dear Miss Osborne , ' I said , ' I beg you will not misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 41]: I can not be sure about it , as you are -- I wish I could -- but I am not disputing it in the least ; I am only trying to make my argument as strong as I can .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 74]: -- I was going to say to Charley -- not to you -- that , if there be a God , he would not have compelled us to be , except with the absolute fore-knowledge that , when we knew all about it , we would certainly declare ourselves ready to go through it all again if need should be , in order to attain the known end of his high calling . '
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 22]: ` But is n't it very presumptuous to assert anything about God which he has not revealed in his Word ? '
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 23]: said Mary , in a gentle , subdued voice , and looking at me with a sweet doubtfulness in her eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 22]: I am only insisting on the perfection of God -- as far as I can understand perfection , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 22]: ` But may not the perfection of God be something very different from anything we _ can _ understand ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 9]: I will go further , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 30]: ` It _ must _ be something that we can not understand -- but different from what we can understand by being greater , not by being less . '
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 16]: ` May n't it be such that we ca n't understand it at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 9]: ` Then how should we ever worship him ?
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 8]: How should we ever rejoice in him ?
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 22]: Surely it is because you see God to be good -- ' ` Or fancy you do , ' interposed Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 26]: ` Or fancy you do , ' I assented , ` that you love him -- not merely because you are told he is good .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 19]: The Fejee islander might assert his God to be good , but would that make you love him ?
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 35]: If you heard that a great power , away somewhere , who had nothing to do with you at all , was very good , would that make you able to love him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 12]: ` Yes , it would , ' said Mary , decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 16]: ` It is only a good man who would see that God was good . '
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 9]: ` There you argue entirely on my side .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 25]: It must be because you supposed his goodness what you call goodness -- not something else -- that you could love him on testimony .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 25]: But even then your love could not be of that mighty absorbing kind which alone you would think fit between you and your God .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 20]: It would not be loving him with all your heart and soul and strength and mind -- would it ?
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 19]: It would be loving him second-hand -- not because of himself , seen and known by yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 19]: ` But Charley does not even love God second-hand , ' she said , with a despairing mournfulness .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 28]: ` Perhaps because he is very anxious to love him first-hand , and what you tell him about God does not seem to him to be good .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 14]: Surely neither man nor woman can love because of what seems not good !
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 25]: I confess one may love in spite of what is bad , but it must be because of other things that are good . '
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 4]: She was silent .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 40]: ` However goodness may change its forms , ' I went on , ` it must still be goodness ; only if we are to adore it , we must see something of what it is -- of itself .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 49]: And the goodness we can not see , the eternal goodness , high above us as the heavens are above the earth , must still be a goodness that includes , absorbs , elevates , purifies all our goodness , not tramples upon it and calls it wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 24]: For if not such , then we have nothing in common with God , and what we call goodness is not of God .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 55]: He has not even ordered it ; or , if he has , he has ordered it only to order the contrary afterwards ; and there is , in reality , no real goodness -- at least in him ; and , if not in him , of whom we spring -- where then ?
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 13]: -- and what becomes of ours , poor as it is ? '
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 62]: My reader will see that I had already thought much about these things ; although , I suspect , I have now not only expressed them far better than I could have expressed them in conversation , but with a degree of clearness which must be owing to the further continuance of the habit of reflecting on these and cognate subjects .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 24]: Deep in my mind , however , something like this lay ; and in some manner like this I tried to express it .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 47]: Finding that she continued silent , and that Charley did not appear inclined to renew the contest , anxious also to leave no embarrassing silence to choke the channel now open between us -- I mean Mary and myself -- I returned to the original question .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 39]: ` It seems to me , Charley -- and it follows from all we have been saying -- that the sin of suicide lies just in this , that it is an utter want of faith in God .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 40]: I confess I do not see any Other ground on which to condemn it -- provided , always , that the man has no other dependent upon him , none for whom he ought to live and work . '
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 11]: ` But does a man owe nothing to himself ? '
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 12]: ` Nothing that I know of , ' I replied . '
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 8]: I am under no obligation to myself .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 19]: How can I divide myself , and say that the one-half of me is indebted to the other ?
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 13]: To my mind , it is a mere fiction of speech . '
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 13]: ` But whence , then , should such a fiction arise ? '
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 11]: objected Charley , willing , perhaps , to defend Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 20]: ` From the dim sense of a real obligation , I suspect -- the object of which is mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 44]: I suspect it really springs from our relation to the unknown God , so vaguely felt that a false form is readily accepted for its embodiment by a being who , in ignorance of its nature , is yet aware of its presence .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 41]: I mean that what seems an obligation to self is in reality a dimly apprehended duty -- an obligation to the unknown God , and not to self , in which lies no causing , therefore no obligating power . '
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 14]: ` But why say _ the unknown God _ , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 3]: asked Mary .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 42]: ` Because I do not believe that any one who knew him could possibly attribute to himself what belonged to Him -- could , I mean , talk of an obligation to himself , when that obligation was to God . '
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 38]: How far Mary Osborne followed the argument or agreed with it I can not tell , but she gave me a look of something like gratitude , and my heart felt too big for its closed chamber .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 23]: At this moment the housemaid who had , along with the carpenter , assisted me in the library , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 26]: She was rather a forward girl , and I suppose presumed on our acquaintance to communicate directly with myself instead of going to the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 18]: Seeing her approach as if she wanted to speak to me , I went to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 35]: She handed me a small ring , saying , in a low voice , ' I found this in your room , sir , and thought it better to bring it to you . '
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 26]: ` Thank you , ' I said , putting it at once on my little finger ; ' I am glad you found it . '
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 7]: Charley and Clara had begun talking .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 34]: I believe Clara was trying to make Charley give her the book he had pocketed , imagining it really of the character he had , half in sport , professed to believe it .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 26]: But Mary had caught sight of the ring , and , with a bewildered expression on her countenance , was making a step towards me .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 21]: I put a finger to my lips , and gave her a look by which I succeeded in arresting her .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 15]: Utterly perplexed , I believe , she turned away towards the bookshelves behind her .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 12]: I went into the next room , and called Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 16]: I think we had better not go on with this talk , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 27]: ` You are very imprudent indeed , Charley , to be always bringing up subjects that tend to widen the gulf between you and your sister .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 33]: When I have a chance , I do what I can to make her doubt whether you are so far wrong as they think you , but you must give her time .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 25]: All your kind of thought is so new to her that your words can not possibly convey to her what is in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 10]: If only she were not so afraid of me !
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 12]: But I think she begins to trust me a little . '
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 10]: ` It 's no use , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 9]: Her head is so full of rubbish ! '
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 12]: ` But her heart is so full of goodness ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 9]: I wish you could make anything of her !
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 32]: But she looks up to my father with such a blind adoration that it is n't of the slightest use attempting to put an atom of sense into her . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 15]: I should indeed despair if I might only set about it after your fashion .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 18]: You always seem to shut your eyes to the mental condition of those that differ from you .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 48]: Instead of trying to understand them first , which gives the sole possible chance of your ever making them understand what you mean , you care only to present your opinions ; and that you do in such a fashion that they must appear to them false .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 55]: You even make yourself seem to hold these for very love of their untruth ; and thus make it all but impossible for them to shake off their fetters : every truth in advance of what they have already learned , will henceforth come to them associated with your presumed backsliding and impenitence . '
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 3]: ` Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 8]: where did you learn their slang ? '
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 3]: cried Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 12]: ` But impenitence , if you like , -- not backsliding .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 8]: I never made any _ profession _ .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 22]: After all , however , their opinions do n't seem to hurt them -- I mean my mother and sister . '
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 12]: ` They must hurt them if only by hindering their growth .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 35]: In time , of course , the angels of the heart will expel the demons of the brain ; but it is a pity the process should be retarded by your behaviour . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 9]: I know I am a brute , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 11]: I _ will _ try to hold my tongue . '
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 30]: ` Depend upon it , ' I went on , ` whatever such hearts can believe , is , as believed by them , to be treated with respect .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 50]: It is because of the truth in it , not because of the falsehood , that they hold it ; and when you speak against the false in it , you appear to them to speak against the true ; for the dogma seems to them an unanalyzable unit .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 23]: You assail the false with the recklessness of falsehood itself , careless of the injury you may inflict on the true . '
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 9]: I was interrupted by the entrance of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 20]: ` If you gentlemen do n't want us any more , we had better go , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 15]: I left Charley to answer her , and went back into the next room .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 25]: Mary stood where I had left her , mechanically shifting and arranging the volumes on a shelf at the height of her eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 24]: I think this is your ring , Miss Osborne , ' I said , in a low and hurried tone , offering it .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 58]: Her expression at first was only of questioning surprise , when suddenly something seemed to cross her mind ; she turned pale as death , and put her hand on the bookshelves as if to support her ; as suddenly flushed crimson for a moment , and again turned deadly pale -- all before I could speak .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 16]: ` Do n't ask me any questions , dear Miss Osborne , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 28]: ` And , please , trust me this far ; do n't mention the loss of your ring to any one , unless it be your mother .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 10]: Allow me to put it on your finger . '
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 16]: -LSB- Illustration : `` I THINK THIS IS YOUR RING , MISS OSBORNE . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 13]: She gave me a glance I can not and would not describe .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 10]: It lies treasured -- for ever , God grant !
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 9]: -- in the secret jewel-house of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 17]: She lifted a trembling left hand , and doubtingly held -- half held it towards me .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 32]: To this day I know nothing of the stones of that ring -- not even their colour ; but I know I should know it at once if I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 15]: My hand trembled more than hers as I put it on the third finger .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 8]: What followed , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 13]: I think I left her there and went into the other room .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 13]: When I returned a little after , I know she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 18]: From that hour , not one word has ever passed between us in reference to the matter .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 21]: The best of my conjectures remains but a conjecture ; I know how the sword got there -- nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 30]: I did not see her again that day , and did not seem to want to see her , but worked on amongst the books in a quiet exultation .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 8]: My being seemed tenfold awake and alive .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 160]: My thoughts dwelt on the rarely revealed loveliness of my _ Athanasia _ ; and , although I should have scorned unspeakably to take the smallest advantage of having come to share a secret with her , I could not help rejoicing in the sense of nearness to and _ alone-ness _ with her which the possession of that secret gave me ; while one of the most precious results of the new love which had thus all at once laid hold upon me , was the feeling -- almost a conviction -- that the dream was not a web self-wove in the loom of my brain , but that from somewhere , beyond my soul even , an influence had mingled with its longings to in-form the vision of that night -- to be as it were a creative soul to what would otherwise have been but loose , chaotic , and shapeless vagaries of the unguided imagination .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 49]: The events of that night were as the sudden opening of a door through which I caught a glimpse of that region of the supernal in which , whatever might be her theories concerning her experiences therein , Mary Osborne certainly lived , if ever any one lived .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 28]: The degree of God 's presence with a creature is not to be measured by that creature 's interpretation of the manner in which he is revealed .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 21]: The great question is whether he is revealed or not ; and a strong truth can carry many parasitical errors .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 62]: I felt that now I could talk freely to her of what most perplexed me -- not so much , I confess , with any hope that she might cast light on my difficulties , as in the assurance that she would not only influence me to think purely and nobly , but would urge me in the search after God .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 67]: In such a relation of love to religion the vulgar mind will ever imagine ground for ridicule ; but those who have most regarded human nature know well enough that the two have constantly manifested themselves in the closest relation ; while even the poorest love is the enemy of selfishness unto the death , for the one or the other must give up the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 20]: Not only must God be in all that is human , but of it he must be the root .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIII .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 6]: THE SWORD IN THE SCALE .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 28]: The next morning Charley and I went as usual to the library , where , later in the day , we were joined by the two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 49]: It was long before our eyes once met , but when at last they did , Mary allowed hers to rest on mine for just one moment with an expression of dove-like beseeching , which I dared to interpret as meaning -- ` Be just to me . '
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 23]: If she read mine , surely she read there that she was safe with my thoughts as with those of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 19]: Charley and I worked late in the afternoon , and went away in the last of the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 42]: As we approached the gate of the park , however , I remembered I had left behind me a book I had intended to carry home for comparison with a copy in my possession , of which the title-page was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 41]: I asked Charley , therefore , to walk on and give my man some directions about Lilith , seeing I had it in my mind to propose a ride on the morrow , while I went back to fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 55]: Finding the door at the foot of the stair leading to the open gallery ajar , and knowing that none of the rooms at either end of it were occupied , I went the nearest way , and thus entered the library at the point furthest from the more public parts of the house .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 31]: The book I sought was , however , at the other end of the suite , for I had laid it on the window-sill of the room next the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 29]: As I entered that room , and while I crossed it towards the glimmering window , I heard voices in the armoury , and soon distinguished Clara 's .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 17]: It never entered my mind that possibly I ought not to hear what might be said .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 24]: Just as I reached the window I was arrested , and stood stock still : the other voice was that of Geoffrey Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 12]: Before my self-possession returned , I had heard what follows . '
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 14]: I am certain _ he _ took it , ' said Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 32]: I did n't see him , of course ; but if you call at the Moat to-morrow , ten to one you will find it hanging on the wall . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 15]: I knew him for a sneak , but never took him for a thief .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 15]: I would have lost anything out of the house rather than that sword ! '
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 10]: ` Do n't you mention my name in it .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 20]: If you do , I shall think you -- well , I will never speak to you again . '
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 11]: ` And if I do n't , what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 12]: Before I heard her answer , I had come to myself .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 8]: I had no time for indignation yet .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 7]: I must meet Geoffrey at once .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 17]: I would not , however , have him know I had overheard any of their talk .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 33]: It would have been more straightforward to allow the fact to be understood , but I shrunk from giving him occasion for accusing me of an eavesdropping of which I was innocent .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 26]: Besides , I had no wish to encounter Clara before I understood her game , which I need not say was a mystery to me .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 9]: What end could she have in such duplicity ?
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 22]: I had had unpleasant suspicions of the truth of her nature before , but could never have suspected her of baseness .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 30]: I stepped quietly into the further room , whence I returned , making a noise with the door-handle , and saying , ` Are you there , Miss Coningham ?
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 13]: Could you help me to find a book I left here ? '
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 25]: There was silence ; but after the briefest pause I heard the sound of her dress as she swept hurriedly out into the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 3]: I advanced .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 29]: On the top of the steps , filling the doorway of the armoury in the faint light from the window , appeared the dim form of Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 10]: I beg your pardon , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 17]: I heard a lady 's voice , and thought it was Miss Coningham 's . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 11]: I can not compliment your ear , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 8]: ` It was one of the maids .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 8]: I had just rung for a light .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 8]: I presume you are Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 13]: I returned to fetch a book I forgot to take with me .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 17]: I suppose you have heard what we 've been about in the library here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 14]: I have been partially informed of it , ' he answered , stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 15]: ` But I have heard also that you contemplate a raid upon the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 10]: I beg you will let the weapons alone . '
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 14]: I had said something of the sort to Clara that very morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 23]: I have a special regard for them , ' he went on ; ` and I do n't want them meddled with .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 11]: It 's not every one knows how to handle them .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 14]: Some amongst them I would not have injured for their weight in diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 27]: One in particular I should like to give you the history of -- just to show you that I am right in being careful over them .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 7]: -- Here comes the light . '
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 33]: I presume it had been hurriedly arranged between them as Clara left him that she should send one of the maids , who in consequence now made her appearance with a candle .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 10]: Brotherton took it from her and approached the wall .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 3]: ` Why !
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 4]: What the devil !
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 10]: Some one has been meddling already , I find !
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 9]: The very sword I speak of is gone !
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 7]: There 's the sheath hanging empty !
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 7]: What _ can _ it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 12]: Do you know anything of this , Mr Cumbermede ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 6]: I do , Mr Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 12]: The sword to which that sheath belongs is _ mine _ .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 6]: I have it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 3]: _ Yours !
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 24]: _ ' he shouted ; then restraining himself , added in a tone of utter contempt -- ` This is rather too much .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 21]: Pray , sir , on what grounds do you lay claim to the smallest atom of property within these walls ?
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 21]: My father ought to have known what he was about when he let you have the run of the house !
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 7]: And the old books , too !
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 8]: By heaven , it 's too much !
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 38]: I always thought -- ' ` It matters little to me what you think , Mr Brotherton -- so little that I do not care to take any notice of your insolence -- ' ` Insolence ! '
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 16]: he roared , striding towards me , as if he would have knocked me down .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 27]: I was not his match in strength , for he was at least two inches taller than I , and of a coarse-built , powerful frame .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 15]: I caught a light rapier from the wall , and stood on my defence .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 4]: ` Coward ! '
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 18]: ` There are more where this came from , ' I answered , pointing to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 19]: He made no move towards arming himself , but stood glaring at me in a white rage . '
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 26]: I am prepared to prove , ' I answered as calmly as I could , ` that the sword to which you allude is mine .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 10]: But I will give _ you _ no explanation .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 23]: If you will oblige me by asking your father to join us , I will tell him the whole story . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 10]: I will have a warrant out against you . '
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 5]: ` As you please .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 9]: I am obliged to you for mentioning it .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 5]: I shall be ready .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 11]: I have the sword , and intend to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 36]: And by the way , I had better secure the scabbard as well , ' I added , as with a sudden spring I caught it also from the wall , and again stood prepared .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 7]: He ground his teeth with rage .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 39]: He was one of those who , trusting to their superior strength , are not much afraid of a row , but can not face cold steel : soldier as he had been , it made him nervous .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 8]: ` Insulted in my own house ! '
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 7]: he snarled from between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 10]: ` Your father 's house , ' I corrected .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 11]: ` Call him , and I will give explanations . '
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 5]: ` Damn your explanations !
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 26]: Get out of the house , you puppy ; or I 'll have the servants up , and have you ducked in the horse-pond . '
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 4]: ` Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 16]: ` There 's not one of them would lay hands on me at your bidding .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 17]: Call your father , I say , or I will go and find him myself . '
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 24]: He broke out in a succession of oaths , using language I had heard in the streets of London , but nowhere else .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 8]: I stood perfectly still , and watchful .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 22]: All at once he turned and went into the gallery , over the balustrade of which he shouted , ` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 16]: Go and tell my father to come here -- to the armoury -- at once .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 13]: Tell him there 's a fellow here out of his mind . '
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 47]: I remained quiet , with my scabbard in one hand , and the rapier in the other -- a dangerous weapon enough , for it was , though slight , as sharp as a needle , and I knew it for a bit of excellent temper .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 8]: Brotherton stood outside waiting for his father .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 13]: In a few moments I heard the voice of the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 3]: ` Boys !
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 3]: boys ! '
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 12]: he cried ; ` what is all this to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 56]: ` Why , sir , ' answered Geoffrey , trying to be calm , ` here 's that fellow Cumbermede confesses to have stolen the most valuable of the swords out of the armoury -- one that 's been in the family for two hundred years , and says he means to keep it . '
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 25]: I just caught the word _ liar _ ere it escaped my lips : I would spare the son in his father 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 3]: ` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 3]: tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 4]: said Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 7]: ` What does it all mean ?
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 11]: You 're at your old quarrelsome tricks , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 11]: Really you ought to be wiser by this time ! '
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 28]: As he spoke , he entered panting , and with the rubicund glow beginning to return upon a face from which the message had evidently banished it .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 3]: ` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 3]: tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 30]: he said again , half starting back as he caught sight of me with the weapon in my hand -- ` What is it all about , Mr Cumbermede ?
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 10]: I thought _ you _ had more sense ! '
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 27]: ` Sir Giles , ' I said , ' I have not confessed to having stolen the sword -- only to having taken it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 13]: A very different thing , ' he returned , trying to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 11]: ` But come now ; tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 11]: We ca n't have quarrelling like this , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 9]: We ca n't have pot-house work here . '
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 25]: ` That is just why I sent for you , Sir Giles , ' I answered , replacing the rapier on the wall . '
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 10]: I want to tell you the whole story . '
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 9]: ` Let 's have it , then . '
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 16]: ` Mind , I do n't believe a word of it , ' said Geoffrey .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 14]: ` Hold your tongue , sir , ' said his father , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 24]: ` Mr Brotherton , ' I said , ' I offered to tell the story to Sir Giles -- not to you . '
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 5]: ` You offered ! '
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 3]: he sneered .
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 22]: ` You may be compelled -- under different circumstances by-and-by , if you do n't mind what you 're about . '
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 10]: ` Come now -- no more of this ! '
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 4]: said Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 26]: Thereupon I began at the beginning , and told him the story of the sword , as I have already given it to my reader .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 17]: He fidgeted a little , but Geoffrey kept himself stock-still during the whole of the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 23]: As soon as I had ended Sir Giles said , ` And you think poor old Close actually carried off your sword !
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 19]: -- Well , he was an odd creature , and had a passion for everything that could kill .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 30]: The poor little atomy used to carry a poniard in the breast-pocket of his black coat -- as if anybody would ever have thought of attacking his small carcass !
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 12]: He was simply a monomaniac in regard of swords and daggers .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 4]: There , Geoffrey !
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 6]: The sword is plainly his .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 20]: _ He _ is the wronged party in the matter , and we owe him an apology . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 20]: I believe the whole to be a pure invention , ' said Geoffrey , who now appeared perfectly calm .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 5]: ` Mr Brotherton ! '
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 8]: I began , but Sir Giles interposed .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 3]: hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 9]: he said , and turned to his son .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 13]: ` My boy , you insult your father 's guest . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 25]: I will at once prove to you , sir , how unworthy he is of any forbearance , not to say protection from you .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 7]: Excuse me for one moment . '
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 21]: He took up the candle , and opening the little door at the foot of the winding stair , disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 23]: Sir Giles and I sat in silence and darkness until he returned , carrying in his hand an old vellum-bound book . '
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 22]: I dare say you do n't know this manuscript , sir , ' he said , turning to his father . '
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 11]: I know nothing about it , ' answered Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 5]: ` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 13]: Or what has it to do with the matter in hand ? '
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 25]: ` Mr Close found it in some corner or other , and used to read it to me when I was a little fellow .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 21]: It is a description , and in most cases a history as well , of every weapon in the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 40]: They had been much neglected , and a great many of the labels were gone , but those which were left referred to numbers in the book-heading descriptions which corresponded exactly to the weapons on which they were found .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 24]: With a little trouble he had succeeded in supplying the numbers where they were missing , for the descriptions are very minute . '
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 9]: He spoke in a tone of perfect self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 19]: ` Well , Geoffrey , I ask again , what has all this to do with it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 59]: ` If Mr Cumbermede will allow you to look at the label attached to the sheath in his hand -- for fortunately it was a rule with Mr Close to put a label on both sword and sheath -- and if you will read me the number , I will read you the description in the book . '
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 19]: I handed the sheath to Sir Giles , who began to decipher the number on the ivory ticket .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 14]: ` The label is quite a new one , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 12]: I have already accounted for that , ' said Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 14]: I will leave it to yourself to decide whether the description corresponds . '
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 22]: Sir Giles read out the number figure by figure , adding -- ` But how are we to test the description ?
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 14]: I do n't know the thing , and it 's not here . '
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 24]: ` It is at the Moat , ' I replied ; ` but its future place is at Sir Giles 's decision . '
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 21]: ` Part of the description belongs to the scabbard you have in your hand , sir , ' said Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 14]: ` The description of the sword itself I submit to Mr Cumbermede . '
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 14]: 'Till the other day I never saw the blade , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 43]: ` Likely enough , ' he retorted dryly , and proceeding , read the description of the half-basket hilt , inlaid with gold , and the broad blade , channeled near the hilt , and inlaid with ornaments and initials in gold .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 16]: ` There is nothing in all that about the scabbard , ' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 29]: ` Stop till we come to the history , ' he replied , and read on , as nearly as I can recall , to the following effect .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 13]: I have never had an opportunity of copying the words themselves . '
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 33]: `` This sword seems to have been expressly forged for Sir -LSB- -- -RSB- -LSB- -- -RSB- , '' ' -LRB- He read it _ Sir So and So _ . -RRB- '
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 11]: `` whose initials are to be found on the blade .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 35]: According to tradition , it was worn by him , for the first and only time , at the battle of Naseby , where he fought in the cavalry led by Sir Marmaduke Langdale .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 44]: From some accident or other , Sir -LSB- -- -RSB- -LSB- -- -RSB- found , just as the order to charge was given , that he could not draw his sword , and had to charge with only a pistol in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 74]: In the flight which followed he pulled up , and unbuckled his sword , but while attempting to ease it , a rush of the enemy startled him , and , looking about , he saw a Roundhead riding straight at Sir Marmaduke , who that moment passed in the rear of his retiring troops -- giving some directions to an officer by his side , and unaware of the nearness of danger .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 32]: Sir -LSB- -- -RSB- -LSB- -- -RSB- put spurs to his charger , rode at the trooper , and dealt him a downright blow on the pot-helmet with his sheathed weapon .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 30]: The fellow tumbled from his horse , and Sir -LSB- -- -RSB- -LSB- -- -RSB- found his scabbard split halfway up , but the edge of his weapon unturned .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 13]: It is said he vowed it should remain sheathed for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 22]: -- The person who has now unsheathed it has done a great wrong to the memory of a loyal cavalier . '
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 27]: ` The sheath halfway split was as familiar to my eyes as the face of my uncle , ' I said , turning to Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 23]: ` And in the only reference I ever heard my great-grandmother make to it , she mentioned the name of Sir Marmaduke .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 7]: I recollect that much perfectly . '
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 18]: ` But how could the sword be there and here at one and the same time ? '
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 5]: said Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 14]: _ That _ I do not pretend to explain , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 21]: ` Here at least is written testimony to our possession of it , ' said Brotherton in a conclusive tone .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 15]: ` How , then , are we to explain Mr Cumbermede 's story ? '
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 9]: said Sir Giles , evidently in good faith .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 12]: ` With that I can not consent to allow myself concerned .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 15]: -- Mr Cumbermede is , I am told , a writer of fiction . '
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 17]: ` Geoffrey , ' said Sir Giles , ` behave yourself like a gentleman . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 13]: I endeavour to do so , ' he returned with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 4]: I kept silence .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 23]: ` How can you suppose , ' the old man went on , ` that Mr Cumbermede would invent such a story ?
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 7]: What object could he have ? '
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 24]: ` He may have a mania for weapons , like old Close -- as well as for old books , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 7]: I thought of my precious folio .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 39]: But I did not yet know how much additional force his insinuation with regard to the motive of my labours in the library would gain if it should be discovered that such a volume was in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 39]: ` You may have remarked , sir , ' he went on , ` that I did not read the name of the owner of the sword in any place where it occurred in the manuscript . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 3]: I did .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 16]: And I beg to know why you kept it back , ' answered Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 13]: ` What do you think the name might be , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 6]: ` How should I know ?
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 7]: I am not an antiquarian . '
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 7]: ` Sir _ Wilfrid Cumbermede _ .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 9]: You will find the initials on the blade .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 17]: -- Does that throw any light on the matter , do you think , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 11]: ` Why , that is your very own name ! '
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 8]: cried Sir Giles , turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 3]: I bowed .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 13]: ` It is a pity the sword should n't be yours . '
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 24]: ` It is mine , Sir Giles -- though , as I said , I am prepared to abide by your decision . '
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 50]: ` And now I remember ; -- the old man resumed , after a moment 's thought -- ` the other evening Mr Alderforge -- a man of great learning , Mr Cumbermede -- told us that the name of Cumbermede had at one time belonged to our family .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 6]: It is all very strange .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 8]: I confess I am utterly bewildered . '
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 86]: ` At least you can understand , sir , how a man of imagination , like Mr Cumbermede here , might desire to possess himself of a weapon which bears his initials , and belonged two hundred years ago to a baronet of the same name as himself -- a circumstance which , notwithstanding it is by no means a common name , is not _ quite _ so strange as at first sight appears -- that is , if all reports are true . '
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 20]: I did not in the least understand his drift ; neither did I care to inquire into it now .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 11]: ` Were you aware of this , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 4]: asked his father .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 10]: ` No , Sir Giles , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 13]: ` Mr Cumbermede has had the run of the place for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 9]: I am sorry I was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 28]: This book was lying all the time on the table in the room above , where poor old Close 's work-bench and polishing-wheel are still standing . '
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 13]: ` Mr Brotherton , this gets beyond bearing , ' I cried .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 22]: ` Nothing but the presence of your father , to whom I am indebted for much kindness , protects you . '
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 3]: ` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 3]: tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 4]: said Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 7]: ` Protects me , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 3]: exclaimed Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 18]: ` Do you dream I should be by any code bound to accept a challenge from you ?
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 24]: -- Not , at least , I presume to think , before a jury had decided on the merits of the case . '
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 13]: My blood was boiling , but what could I do or say ?
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 27]: Sir Giles rose , and was about to leave the room , remarking only -- ' I do n't know what to make of it . '
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 28]: ` At all events , Sir Giles , ' I said hurriedly , ` you will allow me to prove the truth of what I have asserted .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 38]: I can not , unfortunately , call my uncle or aunt , for they are gone ; and I do not know where the servant who was with us when I took the sword away is now .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 54]: But , if you will allow me , I will call Mrs Wilson -- to prove that I had the sword when I came to visit her on that occasion , and that on the morning after sleeping here I complained of its loss to her , and went away without it . '
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 13]: ` It would but serve to show the hallucination was early developed .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 34]: We should probably find that even then you were much attracted by the armoury , ' said Brotherton , with a judicial air , as if I were a culprit before a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 26]: I had begun to see that , although the old man was desirous of being just , he was a little afraid of his son .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 31]: He rose as the latter spoke , however , and going into the gallery , shouted over the balustrade -- ` Some one send Mrs Wilson to the library ! '
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 26]: We removed to the reading-room , I carrying the scabbard which Sir Giles had returned to me as soon as he had read the label .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 18]: Brotherton followed , having first gone up the little turn-pike stair , doubtless to replace the manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 33]: Mrs Wilson came , looking more pinched than ever , and stood before Sir Giles with her arms straight by her sides , like one of the ladies of Noah 's ark .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 14]: I will not weary my reader with a full report of the examination .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 19]: She had seen me _ with _ a sword , but had taken no notice of its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 23]: I _ might _ have taken it from the armoury , for I _ was _ in the library all the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 14]: She had left me there thinking I was a ` gentlemany ' boy .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 25]: I had _ said _ I had lost it , but she was sure _ she _ did not know how that could be .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 37]: She was _ very _ sorry she had caused any trouble by asking me to the house , but Sir Giles would be pleased to remember that he had himself introduced the boy to her notice .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 10]: Little she thought , & c. , & c .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 36]: In fact , the spiteful creature , propitiating her natural sense of justice by hinting instead of plainly suggesting injurious conclusions , was paying me back for my imagined participation in the impertinences of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 19]: She had besides , as I learned afterwards , greatly resented the trouble I had caused of late .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 13]: Brotherton struck in as soon as his father had ceased questioning her .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 33]: ` At all events , if he believed the sword was his , why did he not go and represent the case to you , sir , and request justice from you ?
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 8]: Since then he has had opportunity enough .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 10]: His tale has taken too long to hatch . '
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 11]: ` This is all very paltry , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 40]: ` Not so paltry as your contriving to sleep in the house in order to carry off your host 's property in the morning -- after studying the place to discover which room would suit your purpose best ! '
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 8]: Here I lost my presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 29]: A horror shook me lest something might come out to injure Mary , and I shivered at the thought of her name being once mentioned along with mine .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 29]: If I had taken a moment to reflect , I must have seen that I should only add to the danger by what I was about to say .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 72]: But her form was so inextricably associated in my mind with all that had happened then , that it seemed as if the slightest allusion to any event of that night would inevitably betray her ; and in the tremor which , like an electric shock , passed through me from head to foot , I blurted out words importing that I had never slept in the house in my life .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 19]: ` Your room was got ready for you , anyhow , Master Cumbermede , ' said Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 15]: ` It does not follow that I occupied it , ' I returned . '
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 53]: I can prove that false , ' said Brotherton ; but , probably lest he should be required to produce his witness , only added , -- ` At all events , he was seen in the morning , carrying the sword across the court before any one had been admitted . '
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 52]: I was silent ; for I now saw too clearly that I had made a dreadful blunder , and that any attempt to carry assertion further , or even to explain away my words , might be to challenge the very discovery I would have given my life to ward off .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 32]: As I continued silent , steeling myself to endure , and saying to myself that disgrace was not dishonour , Sir Giles again rose , and turned to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 12]: Evidently he was now satisfied that I was unworthy of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 15]: ` One moment , if you please , Sir Giles , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 30]: ` It is plain to me there is some mystery about this affair , and it does not seem as if I should be able to clear it up .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 11]: The time may come , however , when I can .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 22]: I did wrong , I see now , in attempting to right myself , instead of representing my case to you .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 23]: But that does not alter the fact that the sword was and is mine , however appearances may be to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 30]: In the mean time , I restore you the scabbard , and as soon as I reach home , I shall send my man with the disputed weapon . '
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 21]: ` It will be your better way , ' he said , as he took the sheath from my hand .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 9]: Without another word , he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 5]: Mrs Wilson also retired .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 4]: Brotherton alone remained .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 16]: I took no further notice of him , but followed Sir Giles through the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 49]: He came after me , step for step , at a little distance , and as I stepped out into the gallery , said , in a tone of insulting politeness : ` You will send the sword as soon as may be quite convenient , Mr Cumbermede ?
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 9]: Or shall I send and fetch it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 16]: I turned and faced him in the dim light which came up from the hall .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 39]: ` Mr Brotherton , if you knew that book and those weapons as early as you have just said , you can not help knowing that at that time the sword was _ not _ there . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 11]: I decline to re-open the question , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 34]: A fierce word leaped to my lips , but repressing it I turned away once more , and walked slowly down the stair , across the hall , and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIV .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 38]: I PART WITH MY SWORD I made haste out of the park , but wandered up and down my own field for half an hour , thinking in what shape to put what had occurred before Charley .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 23]: My perplexity arose not so much from the difficulty involved in the matter itself as from my inability to fix my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 28]: My brain was for the time like an ever-revolving kaleidoscope , in which , however , there was but one fair colour -- the thought of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 42]: Having at length succeeded in arriving at some conclusion , I went home , and would have despatched Styles at once with the sword , had not Charley already sent him off to the stable , so that I must wait .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 13]: ` What _ has _ kept you so long , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 7]: Charley asked , as I entered .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 14]: ` I 've had a tremendous row with Brotherton , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 4]: ` The brute !
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 4]: Is he there ?
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 7]: I 'm glad I was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 7]: What was it all about ? '
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 5]: ` About that sword .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 18]: It was very foolish of me to take it without saying a word to Sir Giles . '
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 10]: ` So it was , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 14]: I ca n't think how _ you _ could be so foolish ! '
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 6]: I could , well enough .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 32]: What with the dream and the waking , I could think little about anything else ; and only since the consequences had overtaken me , saw how unwisely I had acted .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 80]: I now told Charley the greater part of the affair -- omitting the false step I had made in saying I had not slept in the house ; and also , still with the vague dread of leading to some discovery , omitting to report the treachery of Clara ; for , if Charley should talk to her or Mary about it , which was possible enough , I saw several points where the danger would lie very close .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 20]: I simply told him that I had found Brotherton in the armoury , and reported what followed between us .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 60]: I did not at all relish having now in my turn secrets from Charley , but my conscience did not trouble me about it , seeing it was for his sister 's sake ; and when I saw the rage of indignation into which he flew , I was , if possible , yet more certain I was right .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 65]: I told him I must go and find Styles , that he might take the sword at once ; but he started up , saying he would carry it back himself , and at the same time take his leave of Sir Giles , whose house , of course , he could never enter again after the way I had been treated in it .
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 50]: I saw this would lead to a rupture with the whole family , but I should not regret that , for there could be no advantage to Mary either in continuing her intimacy , such as it was , with Clara , or in making further acquaintance with Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 23]: The time of their departure was also close at hand , and might be hastened without necessarily involving much of the unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 34]: Also , if Charley broke with them at once , there would be the less danger of his coming to know that I had not given him all the particulars of my discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 23]: If he were to find I had told a falsehood , how could I explain to him why I had done so ?
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 34]: This arguing on probabilities made me feel like a culprit who has to protect himself by concealment ; but I will not dwell upon my discomfort in the half-duplicity thus forced upon me .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 6]: I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 19]: I got down the sword , and together we looked at it for the first and last time .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 11]: I found the description contained in the book perfectly correct .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 49]: The upper part was inlaid with gold in a Greekish pattern , crossed by the initials W. C. I gave it up to Charley with a sigh of submission to the inevitable , and having accompanied him to the park-gate , roamed my field again until his return .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 33]: He rejoined me in a far quieter mood , and for a moment or two I was silent with the terror of learning that he had become acquainted with my unhappy blunder .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 19]: After a little pause , he said , ` I 'm very sorry I did n't see Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 13]: I should have liked just a word or two with him . '
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 12]: ` It 's just as well not , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 9]: ` You would only have made another row .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 10]: Did n't you see any of them ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 6]: I saw the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 13]: He seemed really cut up about it , and professed great concern .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 17]: He did n't even refer to you by name -- and spoke only in general terms .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 46]: I told him you were incapable of what was laid to your charge ; that I had not the slightest doubt of your claim to the sword , -- your word being enough for me , -- and that I trusted time would right you .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 22]: I went too far there , however , for I have n't the slightest hope of anything of the sort . '
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 9]: ` How did he take all that ? '
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 27]: ` He only smiled -- incredulously and sadly , -- so that I could n't find it in my heart to tell him all my mind .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 11]: I only insisted on my own perfect confidence in you .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 12]: -- I 'm afraid I made a poor advocate , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 12]: Why should I mind his grey hairs where justice is concerned ?
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 12]: I am afraid I was false to you , Wilfrid . '
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 13]: ` Nonsense ; you did just the right thing , old boy .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 8]: Nobody could have done better . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 7]: _ Do _ you think so ?
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 7]: I am _ so _ glad !
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 37]: I have been feeling ever since as if I ought to have gone into a rage , and shaken the dust of the place from my feet for a witness against the whole nest of them !
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 21]: But somehow I could n't -- what with the honest face and the sorrowful look of the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 36]: ` You are always too much of a partisan , Charley ; I do n't mean so much in your actions -- for this very one disproves that -- but in your notions of obligation .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 44]: You forget that you had to be just to Sir Giles as well as to me , and that he must be judged -- not by the absolute facts of the case , but by what appeared to him to be the facts .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 7]: He could not help misjudging me .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 8]: But you ought to help misjudging him .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 25]: So you see your behaviour was guided by an instinct or a soul , or what you will , deeper than your judgment . '
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 22]: ` That may be -- but he ought to have known you better than believe you capable of misconduct . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 6]: I do n't know that .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 8]: He had seen very little of me .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 11]: But I dare say he puts it down to cleptomania .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 19]: I think he will be kind enough to give the ugly thing a fine name for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 14]: Besides , he must hold either by his son or by me . '
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 16]: ` That 's the worst that can be said on my side of the question .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 21]: He must by this time be aware that that son of his is nothing better than a low scoundrel . '
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 19]: ` It takes much to convince a father of such an unpleasant truth as that , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 13]: ` Not much , if my experience goes for anything . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 11]: I trust it is not typical , Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 14]: I suppose you 're going to stand up for Geoffrey next ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 6]: I have no such intention .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 14]: But if I did , it would be but to follow your example .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 10]: We seem to change sides every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 17]: You remember how you used to defend Clara when I expressed my doubts about her . '
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 7]: ` And was n't I right ?
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 10]: Did n't you come over to my side ? '
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 44]: ` Yes , I did , ' I said , and hastened to change the subject ; adding , ` As for Geoffrey , there is room enough to doubt whether he believes what he says , and that makes a serious difference .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 21]: In thinking over the affair since you left me , I have discovered further grounds for questioning his truthfulness . '
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 8]: ` As if that were necessary ! '
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 10]: he exclaimed , with an accent of scorn . '
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 8]: But tell me what you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 17]: ` In turning the thing over in my mind , this question has occurred to me .
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 25]: -- He read from the manuscript that oh the blade of the sword , near the hilt , were the initials of Wilfrid Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 24]: Now , if the sword had never been drawn from the scabbard , how was that to be known to the writer ? '
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 13]: ` Perhaps it was written about that time , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 13]: ` No ; the manuscript was evidently written some considerable time after .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 8]: It refers to tradition concerning it . '
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 10]: ` Then the writer knew it by tradition . '
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 13]: The moment Charley 's logical faculty was excited his perception was impartial .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 23]: ` Besides , ' he went on , ' it does not follow that the sword had really never been drawn before .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 24]: Mr Close even may have done so , for his admiration was apparently quite as much for weapons themselves as for their history .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 19]: Clara could hardly have drawn it as she did if it had not been meddled with before . '
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 21]: The terror lest he should ask me how I came to carry it home without the scabbard hurried my objection .
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 26]: ` That supposition , however , would only imply that Brotherton might have learned the fact from the sword itself , not from the book .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 22]: I should just like to have one peep of the manuscript to see whether what he read was all there ! '
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 14]: ` Or any of it , for that matter , ' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 20]: ` Only it would have been a more tremendous risk than I think he would have run . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 12]: I wish I had thought of it sooner , though . '
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 20]: My suspicion was that Clara had examined the blade thoroughly , and given him a full description of it .
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 61]: He _ might _ , however , have been at the Hall on some previous occasion , without my knowledge , and might have seen the half-drawn blade on the wall , examined it , and pushed it back into the sheath ; which might have so far loosened the blade that Clara was afterwards able to draw it herself .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 23]: I was all but certain by this time that it was no other than she that had laid it on my bed .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 8]: But then why had she drawn it ?
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 28]: Perhaps that I might leave proof of its identity behind me -- for the carrying out of her treachery , whatever the object of it might be .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 22]: But this opened a hundred questions not to be discussed , even in silent thought , in the presence of another .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 10]: ` Did you see your mother , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 12]: ` No , I thought it better not to trouble her .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 5]: They are going to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 26]: Mary had persuaded her -- why , I do n't know -- to return a day or two sooner than they had intended . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 14]: I hope Brotherton will not succeed in prejudicing them against me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 10]: I wish that were possible , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 12]: ` But the time for prejudice is long gone by . '
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 26]: I could not believe this to be the case in respect of Mary ; for I could not but think her favourably inclined to me .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 38]: ` Still , ' I said , ' I should not like their bad opinion of me to be enlarged as well as strengthened by the belief that I had attempted to steal Sir Giles 's property .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 12]: You _ must _ stand my friend there , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 12]: ` Then you _ do _ doubt me , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 10]: ` Not a bit , you foolish fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 65]: ` You know , I ca n't enter that house again , and I do n't care about writing to my mother , for my father is sure to see it ; but I will follow my mother and Mary the moment they are out of the grounds to-morrow , and soon see whether they 've got the story by the right end . '
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 109]: The evening passed with me in alternate fits of fierce indignation and profound depression , for , while I was clear to my own conscience in regard of my enemies , I had yet thrown myself bound at their feet by my foolish lie ; and I all but made up my mind to leave the country , and only return after having achieved such a position -- of what sort I had no more idea than the school-boy before he sets himself to build a new castle in the air -- as would buttress any assertion of the facts I might see fit to make in after-years .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 29]: When we had parted for the night , my brains began to go about , and the centre of their gyrations was not Mary now , but Clara .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 10]: What could have induced her to play me false ?
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 32]: All my vanity , of which I had enough , was insufficient to persuade me that it could be out of revenge for the gradual diminution of my attentions to her .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 37]: She had seen me pay none to Mary , I thought , unless she had caught a glimpse from the next room of the little passage of the ring , and that I did not believe .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 23]: Neither did I believe she had ever cared enough about me to be jealous of whatever attentions I might pay to another .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 14]: But in all my conjectures , I had to confess myself utterly foiled .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 6]: I could imagine no motive .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 55]: Two possibilities alone , both equally improbable , suggested themselves -- the one , that she did it for pure love of mischief , which , false as she was to me , I could not believe ; the other , which likewise I rejected , that she wanted to ingratiate herself with Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 19]: I had still , however , scarcely a doubt that she had laid the sword on my bed .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 93]: Trying to imagine a connection between this possible action and Mary 's mistake , I built up a conjectural form of conjectural facts to this effect -- that Mary had seen her go into my room , had taken it for the room she was to share with her , and had followed her either at once -- in which case I supposed Clara to have gone out by the stair to the roof to avoid being seen -- or afterwards , from some accident , without a light in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 36]: But I do not care to set down more of my speculations , for none concerning this either were satisfactory to myself , and I remain almost as much in the dark to this day .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 48]: In any case the fear remained that Clara must be ever on the borders of the discovery of Mary 's secret , if indeed she did not know it already , which was a dreadful thought -- more especially as I could place no confidence in her .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 28]: I was glad to think , however , that they were to be parted so soon , and I had little fear of any correspondence between them .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 18]: The next morning Charley set out to waylay them at a certain point on their homeward journey .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 8]: I did not propose to accompany him .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 35]: I preferred having him speak for me first , not knowing how much they might have heard to my discredit , for it was far from probable the matter had been kept from them .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 23]: After he had started , however , I could not rest , and for pure restlessness sent Styles to fetch my mare .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 36]: The loss of my sword was a trifle to me now , but the proximity of the place where I should henceforth be regarded as what I hardly dared to realize , was almost unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 35]: As if I had actually been guilty of what was laid to my charge , I longed to hide myself in some impenetrable depth , and kept looking out impatiently for Styles 's return .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 36]: At length I caught sight of my Lilith 's head rising white from the hollow in which the farm lay , and ran up to my room to make a little change in my attire .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 26]: Just as I snatched my riding-whip from a hook by the window , I spied a horseman approaching from the direction of the park gates .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 14]: Once more it was Mr Coningham , riding hitherward from the windy trees .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 52]: In no degree inclined to meet him , I hurried down the stair , and arriving at the very moment Styles drew up , sprung into the saddle , and would have galloped off in the opposite direction , confident that no horse of Mr Coningham 's could overtake my Lilith .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 79]: But the moment I was in the saddle , I remembered there was a pile of books on the window-sill of my uncle 's room , belonging to the library at the Hall , and I stopped a moment to give Styles the direction to take them home at once , and , having asked a word of Miss Pease , to request her , with my kind regards , to see them safely deposited amongst the rest .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 28]: In consequence of this delay , just as I set off at full speed from the door , Mr Coningham rode round the corner of the house .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 15]: ` What a devil of a hurry you are in , Mr Cumbermede ! '
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 4]: he cried . '
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 8]: I was just coming to see you .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 9]: Ca n't you spare me a word ? '
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 16]: I was forced to pull up , and reply as civilly as might be . '
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 27]: I am only going for a ride , ' I said , ` and will go part of your way with you if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 12]: That will suit me admirably , I am going Gastford way .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 7]: Have you ever been there ? '
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 8]: ` No , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 12]: I have only just heard the name of the village . '
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 7]: ` It is a pretty place .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 38]: But there 's the oddest old church you ever saw , within a couple of miles of it -- alone in the middle of a forest -- or at least it was a forest not long ago .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 7]: It is mostly young trees now .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 34]: There is n't a house within a mile of it , and the nearest stands as lonely as the church -- quite a place to suit the fancy of a poet like you !
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 6]: Come along and see it .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 18]: You may as well go one way as another , if you only want a ride . '
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 7]: ` How far is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 9]: ` Only seven or eight miles across country .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 13]: I can take you all the way through lanes and fields . '
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 38]: Perplexed or angry I was always disinclined for speech ; and it was only after things had arranged themselves in my mind , or I had mastered my indignation , that I would begin to feel communicative .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 44]: But something prudential inside warned me that I could not afford to lose any friend I had ; and although I was not prepared to confide my wrongs to Mr Coningham , I felt I might some day be glad of his counsel .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLV .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 3]: UMBERDEN CHURCH .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 25]: My companion chatted away , lauded my mare , asked if I had seen Clara lately , and how the library was getting on .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 13]: I answered him carelessly , without even a hint at my troubles .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 11]: ` You seem out of spirits , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 9]: ` You 've been taking too little exercise .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 6]: Let 's have a canter .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 6]: It will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 9]: Here 's a nice bit of sward . '
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 23]: I was only too ready to embrace the excuse for dropping a conversation towards which I was unable to contribute my share .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 38]: Having reached a small roadside inn , we gave our horses a little refreshment ; after which , crossing a field or two by jumping the stiles , we entered the loveliest lane I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 25]: It was so narrow that there was just room for horses to pass each other , and covered with the greenest sward rarely trodden .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 12]: It ran through the midst of a wilderness of tall hazels .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 71]: They stood up on both sides of it , straight and trim as walls , high above our heads as we sat on our horses ; and the lane was so serpentine that we could never see further than a few yards ahead ; while , towards the end , it kept turning so much in one direction that we seemed to be following the circumference of a little circle .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 23]: It ceased at length at a small double-leaved gate of iron , to which we tied our horses before entering the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 23]: But instead of a neat burial-place , which the whole approach would have given us to expect , we found a desert .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 15]: The grass was of extraordinary coarseness , and mingled with quantities of vile-looking weeds .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 30]: Several of the graves had not even a spot of green upon them , but were mere heaps of yellow earth in huge lumps , mixed with large stones .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 24]: There was not above a score of graves in the whole place , two or three of which only had gravestones on them .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 18]: One lay open , with the rough yellow lumps all about it , and completed the desolation .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 35]: The church was nearly square -- small , but shapeless , with but four latticed windows , two on one side , one in the other , and the fourth in the east end .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 25]: It was built partly of bricks and partly of flint stones , the walls bowed and bent , and the roof waved and broken .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 22]: Its old age had gathered none of the graces of age to soften its natural ugliness , or elevate its insignificance .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 15]: Except a few lichens , there was not a mark of vegetation about it .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 13]: Not a single ivy leaf grew on its spotted and wasted walls .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 45]: It gave a hopeless , pagan expression to the whole landscape -- for it stood on a rising ground , from which we had an extensive prospect of height and hollow , cornfield and pasture and wood , away to the dim blue horizon .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 14]: ` You do n't find it enlivening , do you -- eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 5]: said my companion . '
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 26]: I never saw such a frightfully desolate spot , ' I said , ` to have yet the appearance of a place of Christian worship .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 11]: It looks as if there were a curse upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 10]: Are all those the graves of suicides and murderers ?
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 9]: It can not surely be consecrated ground ? '
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 11]: ` It 's not nice , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 9]: I did n't expect you to like it .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 8]: I only said it was odd . '
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 10]: ` Is there any service held in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 9]: ` Yes -- once a fortnight or so .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 11]: The rector has another living a few miles off . '
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 9]: ` Where can the congregation come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 5]: ` Hardly from anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 13]: There ai n't generally more than five or six , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 12]: Let 's have a look at the inside of it . '
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 13]: ` The windows are much too high , and no foothold . '
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 7]: ` We 'll go in . '
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 8]: ` Where can you get the key ?
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 14]: It must be a mile off at least , by your own account .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 12]: There 's no house nearer than that , you say . '
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 36]: He made me no reply , but going to the only flat gravestone , which stood on short thick pillars , he put his hand beneath it , and drew out a great rusty key .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 13]: ` Country lawyers know a secret or two , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 24]: ` Not always much worth knowing , ' I rejoined , -- ` if the inside be no better than the outside . '
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 23]: ` We 'll have a look , anyhow , ' he said , as he turned the key in the dry lock .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 23]: The door snarled on its hinges , and disclosed a space drearier certainly , and if possible uglier , than its promise .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 28]: ` Really , Mr Coningham , ' I said , ' I do n't see why you should have brought me to look at this place . '
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 11]: ` It answered for a bait , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 16]: You 've had a good long ride , which was the best thing for you .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 10]: Look what a wretched little vestry that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 19]: It was but a corner of the east end , divided off by a faded red curtain . '
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 13]: I suppose they keep a parish register here , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 8]: ` Let us have a look . '
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 11]: Behind the curtain hung a dirty surplice and a gown .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 15]: In the corner stood a desk like the schoolmaster 's in a village school .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 24]: There was a shelf with a few vellum-bound books on it , and nothing else , not even a chair in the place .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 8]: ` Yes ; there they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 15]: he said , as he took down one of the volumes from the shelf .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 15]: ` This one comes to a close in the middle of the last century .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 19]: I dare say there is something in this , now , that would be interesting enough to somebody .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 12]: Who knows how many properties it might make change hands ? '
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 8]: ` Not many , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 10]: Those matters are pretty well seen to now . '
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 17]: -LSB- Illustration : `` COUNTRY LAWYERS KNOW A SECRET OR TWO , '' HE SAID . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 13]: ` By some one or other -- not always the rightful heirs .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 11]: Life is full of the strangest facts , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 35]: If I were a novelist , now , like you , my experience would make me dare a good deal more in the way of invention than any novelist I happen to have read .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 7]: Look there , for instance . '
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 19]: He pointed to the top of the last page , or rather the last half of the cover .
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 10]: I read as follows : ` MARRIAGES , 1748 .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 43]: ` Mr Wilfrid Cumbermede Daryll , of the Parish of -LSB- -- -RSB- second son of Sir Richard Daryll of Moldwarp Hall in the County of -LSB- -- -RSB- and Mistress Elizabeth Woodruffe were married by a license Jan. 15 . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 13]: I do n't know the name of Daryll , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 14]: ` It was your own great-grandfather 's name , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 8]: I happen to know that much . '
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 14]: ` You knew this was here , Mr Coningham , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 10]: ` That is why you brought me here . '
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 5]: ` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 5]: I did know it .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 11]: Was I wrong in thinking it would interest you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 4]: ` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 6]: I am obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 5]: But why this mystery ?
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 15]: Why not have told me what you wanted me to go for ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 7]: I will why you in turn .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 28]: Why should I have wanted to show you now more than any other time what I have known for as many years almost as you have lived ?
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 23]: You spoke of a ride -- why should n't I give a direction to it that might pay you for your trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 16]: And why should n't I have a little amusement out of it if I pleased ?
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 38]: Why should n't I enjoy your surprise at finding in a place you had hardly heard of , and would certainly count most uninteresting , the record of a fact that concerned your own existence so nearly ?
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 4]: There ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 31]: I confess it interests me more than you will easily think -- inasmuch as it seems to offer to account for things that have greatly puzzled me for some time .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 39]: I have of late met with several hints of a connection at one time or other between the Moat and the Hall , but these hints were so isolated that I could weave no theory to connect them .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 11]: Now I dare say they will clear themselves up . '
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 15]: ` Not a doubt of-that , if you set about it in earnest . '
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 11]: ` How did he come to drop his surname ? '
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 9]: ` That has to be accounted for . '
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 8]: ` It follows -- does it not ?
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 17]: -- that I am of the same blood as the present possessors of Moldwarp Hall ? '
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 18]: ` You are -- but the relation is not a close one , ' said Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 16]: ` Sir Giles was but distantly related to the stock of which you come . '
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 13]: ` Then -- but I must turn it over in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 8]: I am rather in a maze . '
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 11]: ` You have got some papers at the Moat ? '
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 5]: he said -- interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 12]: ` Yes ; my friend Osborne has been looking over them .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 42]: He found out this much -- that there was once some connection between the Moat and the Hall , but at a far earlier date than this points to , or any of the hints to which I just now referred .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 54]: The other day , when I dined at Sir Giles 's , Mr Alderforge said that Cumbermede was a name belonging to Sir Giles 's ancestry -- or something to that effect ; but that again could have had nothing to do with those papers , or with the Moat at all . '
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 16]: Here I stopped , for I could not bring myself to refer to the sword .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 25]: It was not merely that the subject was too painful : of all things I did not want to be cross-questioned by my lawyer-companion .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 16]: ` It is not amongst those you will find anything of importance , I suspect .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 25]: Did your great-grandmother -- the same , no doubt , whose marriage is here registered -- leave no letters or papers behind her ? '
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 9]: ` I 've come upon a few letters .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 11]: I do n't know if there is anything more . '
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 11]: ` You have n't read them , apparently . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 4]: I have not .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 20]: I 've been always going to read them , but I have n't opened one of them yet . '
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 31]: ` Then I recommend you -- that is , if you care for an interesting piece of family history -- to read those letters carefully , that is constructively . '
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 8]: ` What do you mean ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 28]: I mean -- putting two and two together , and seeing what comes of it ; trying to make everything fit into one , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 4]: I understand you .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 27]: But how do you happen to know that those letters contain a history , or that it will prove interesting when I have found it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 33]: ` All family history ought to be interesting -- at least to the last of his race , ' he returned , replying only to the latter half of my question . '
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 19]: It must , for one thing , make him feel his duty to his ancestors more strongly . '
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 12]: ` His duty to marry , I suppose you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 7]: I said with some inward bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 20]: ` But to tell the truth , I do n't think the inheritance worth it in my case . '
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 23]: ` It might be better , ' he said , with an expression which seemed odd beside the simplicity of the words .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 29]: you think then to urge me to make money ; and for the sake of my dead ancestors increase the inheritance of those that may come after me ?
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 32]: But I believe I am already as diligent as is good for me -- that is , in the main , for I have been losing time of late . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 9]: I meant no such thing , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 24]: I should be very doubtful whether any amount of success in literature would enable you to restore the fortunes of your family . '
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 11]: ` Were they so very ponderous , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 11]: But in truth I have little ambition of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 24]: All I will readily confess to is a strong desire not to shirk what work falls to my share in the world . '
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 26]: ` Yes , ' he said , in a thoughtful manner -- ` if one only knew what his share of the work was . '
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 17]: The remark was unexpected , and I began to feel a little more interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 13]: ` Had n't you better take a copy of that entry ? '
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 7]: ` Yes -- perhaps I had .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 7]: But I have no materials . '
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 48]: It did not strike me that attorneys do not usually , like excise-men , carry about an ink-bottle , when he drew one from the breast-pocket of his coat , along with a folded sheet of writing-paper , which he opened and spread out on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 13]: I took the pen he offered me , and copied the entry .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 20]: When I had finished , he said -- ` Leave room under it for the attestation of the parson .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 10]: We can get that another time , if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 17]: Then write , `` Copied by me '' -- and then your name and the date .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 7]: It may be useful some time .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 13]: Take it home and lay it with your grandmother 's papers . '
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 27]: ` There can be no harm in that , ' I said , as I folded it up , and put it in my pocket . '
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 14]: I am greatly obliged to you for bringing me here , Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 38]: Though I am not ambitious of restoring the family to a grandeur of which every record has departed , I am quite sufficiently interested in its history , and shall consequently take care of this document . '
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 16]: ` Mind you read your grandmother 's papers , though , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 7]: I will , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 57]: He replaced the volume on the shelf , and we left the church ; he locked the door and replaced the key under the gravestone ; we mounted our horses , and after riding with me about half the way to the Moat , he took his leave at a point where our roads , diverged .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 26]: I resolved to devote that very evening , partly in the hope of distracting my thoughts , to the reading of my grandmother 's letters .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVI .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 3]: MY FOLIO .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 14]: When I reached home I found Charley there , as I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 9]: But a change had again come over him .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 9]: He was nervous , restless , apparently anxious .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 9]: I questioned him about his mother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 26]: He had met them as planned , and had , he assured me , done his utmost to impress them with the truth concerning me .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 41]: But he had found his mother incredulous , and had been unable to discover from her how much she had heard ; while Mary maintained an obstinate silence , and , as he said , looked more stupid than usual .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 28]: He did not tell me that Clara had accompanied them so far , and that he had walked with her back to the entrance of the park .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 5]: This I heard afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 56]: When we had talked a while over the sword-business -- for we could not well keep off it long -- Charley seeming all the time more uncomfortable than ever , he said , perhaps merely to turn the talk into a more pleasant channel -- By the way , where have you put your folio ?
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 19]: I 've been looking for it ever since I came in , but I ca n't find it .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 27]: A new reading started up in my head the other day , and I want to try it both with the print and the context . '
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 20]: ` It 's in my room , ' I answered , ' I will go and fetch it . '
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 10]: ` We will go together , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 16]: I looked where I thought I had laid it , but there it was not .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 8]: A pang of foreboding terror invaded me .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 13]: Charley told me afterwards that I turned as white as a sheet .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 54]: I looked everywhere , but in vain ; ran and searched my uncle 's room , and then Charley 's , but still in vain ; and at last , all at once , remembered with certainty that two nights before I had laid it on the window-sill in my uncle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 30]: I shouted for Styles , but he was gone home with the mare , and I had to wait , in little short of agony , until he returned .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 10]: The moment he entered I began to question him .
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 10]: ` You took those books home , Styles ? '
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 27]: I said , as quietly as I could , anxious not to startle him , lest it should interfere with the just action of his memory .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 26]: I took them at once , and gave them into Miss Pease 's own hands ; -- at least I suppose it was Miss Pease .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 10]: She was n't a young lady , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 8]: ` All right , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 8]: How many were there of them ? '
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 7]: ` Six , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 15]: I told you five , ' I said , trembling with apprehension and wrath .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 18]: ` You said four or five , and I never thought but the six were to go .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 9]: They were all together on the window-sill . '
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 4]: I stood speechless .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 6]: Charley took up the questioning .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 8]: ` What sized books were they ? '
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 31]: ` Pretty biggish -- one of them quite a large one -- the same I 've seen you , gentlemen , more than once , putting your heads together over .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 8]: At least it looked like it . '
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 11]: ` Charley started up and began pacing about the room .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 34]: Styles saw he had committed some dreadful mistake , and began a blundering expression of regret , but neither of us took any notice of him , and he crept out in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 13]: It was some time before either of us could utter a word .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 11]: The loss of the sword was a trifle to this .
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 47]: Beyond a doubt the precious tome was now lying in the library of Moldwarp Hall -- amongst old friends and companions , possibly -- where years on years might elapse before one loving hand would open it , or any eyes gaze on it with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 6]: ` Lost , Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 5]: I said at last .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 7]: -- ` Irrecoverably lost ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 15]: I will go and fetch it , ' he cried , starting up . '
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 11]: I will tell Clara to bring it out to me .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 6]: It is beyond endurance this .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 20]: Why should you not go and claim what both of us can take our oath to as yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 33]: ` You forget , Charley , how the sword-affair cripples us -- and how the claiming of this volume would only render their belief with regard to the other the more probable .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 50]: You forget , too , that I _ might _ have placed it in the chest first , and , above all , that the name on the title-page is the same as the initials on the blade of the sword , -- the same as my own . '
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 10]: ` Yes -- I see it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 13]: And yet if I were to represent the thing to Sir Giles ?
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 25]: -- He does n't care for old books -- ' ` You forget again , Charley , that the volume is of great money-value .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 48]: Perhaps my late slip has made me fastidious ; but though the book be mine -- and if I had it , the proof of the contrary would lie with them -- I could not take advantage of Sir Giles 's ignorance to recover it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 41]: I might , however , get Clara -- she is a favourite with him , you know -- ' ' I will not hear of it , ' I said , interrupting him , and he was forced to yield .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 17]: ` No , Charley , ' I said again ; ' I must just bear it .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 21]: Harder things _ have _ been borne , and men have got through the world and out of it notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 25]: If there is n't another world , why should we care much for the loss of what _ must _ go with the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 14]: -- and if there is , why should we care at all ? '
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 6]: ` Very fine , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 17]: but when you come to the practice -- why , the less said the better . '
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 16]: ` But that is the very point : we do n't come to the practice .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 15]: If we did , then the ground of it would be proved unobjectionable . '
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 49]: ` True ; -- but if the practice be unattainable -- ' ` It would take much proving to prove that to my -- dissatisfaction I should say ; and more failure besides , I can tell you , than there will be time for in this world .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 18]: If it were proved , however -- do n't you see it would disprove both suppositions equally ?
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 26]: If such a philosophical spirit be unattainable , it discredits both sides of the alternative on either of which it would have been reasonable . '
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 35]: ` There is a sophism there of course , but I am not in the mood for pulling your logic to pieces , ' returned Charley , still pacing up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 41]: In sum , nothing would come of all our talk but the assurance that the volume was equally irrecoverable with the sword , and indeed with my poor character -- at least , in the eyes of my immediate neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 20]: -LSB- Illustration : I SAT DOWN AGAIN BY THE FIRE TO READ , IN MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER 'S CHAIR . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVII .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 6]: THE LETTERS AND THEIR STORY .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 34]: As soon as Charley went to bed , I betook myself to my grandmother 's room , in which , before discovering my loss , I had told Styles to kindle a fire .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 19]: I had said nothing to Charley about my ride , and the old church , and the marriage-register .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 78]: For the time , indeed , I had almost lost what small interest I had taken in the matter -- my new bereavement was so absorbing and painful ; but feeling certain , when he left me , that I should not be able to sleep , but would be tormented all night by innumerable mental mosquitoes if I made the attempt , and bethinking me of my former resolution , I proceeded to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 20]: The fire was burning brightly , and my reading lamp was on the table , ready to be lighted .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 19]: But I sat down first in my grandmother 's chair and mused for I know not how long .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 13]: At length my wandering thoughts rehearsed again the excursion with Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 30]: I pulled the copy of the marriage-entry from my pocket , and in reading it over again , my curiosity was sufficiently roused to send me to the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 66]: I lighted my lamp at last , unlocked what had seemed to my childhood a treasury of unknown marvels , took from it the packet of yellow withered letters , and sat down again by the fire to read , in my great-grandmother 's chair , the letters of Wilfrid Cumbermede Daryll -- for so he signed himself in all of them -- my great-grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 24]: There were amongst them a few of her own in reply to his -- badly written and badly spelt , but perfectly intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 162]: I will not transcribe any of them -- I have them to show if needful -- but not at my command at the present moment ; -- for I am writing neither where I commenced my story -- on the outskirts of an ancient city , nor at the Moat , but in a dreary old square in London ; and those letters lie locked again in the old bureau , and have lain unvisited through thousands of desolate days and slow creeping nights , in that room which I can not help feeling sometimes as if the ghost of that high-spirited , restless-hearted grandmother of mine must now and then revisit , sitting in the same old chair , and wondering to find how far it was all receded from her -- wondering , also , to think what a work she made , through her long and weary life , about things that look to her now such trifles .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 50]: I do not then transcribe any of the letters , but give , in a connected form , what seem to me the facts I gathered from them ; not hesitating to present , where they are required , self-evident conclusions as if they were facts mentioned in them .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 19]: I repeat that none of my names are real , although they all point at the real names .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 15]: Wilfrid Cumbermede was the second son of Richard and Mary Daryll of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 84]: He was baptized Cumbermede from the desire to keep in memory the name of a celebrated ancestor , the owner , in fact , of the disputed sword -- itself alluded to in the letters , -- who had been more mindful of the supposed rights of his king than the next king was of the privations undergone for his sake , for Moldwarp Hall at least was never recovered from the Roundhead branch of the family into whose possession it had drifted .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 54]: In the change , however , which creeps on with new generations , there had been in the family a re-action of sentiment in favour of the more distinguished of its progenitors ; and Richard Daryll , a man of fierce temper and overbearing disposition , had named his son after the cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 56]: A tyrant in his family , at least in the judgment of the writers of those letters , he apparently found no trouble either with his wife or his eldest or youngest son ; while , whether his own fault or not , it was very evident that from Wilfrid his annoyances had been numerous .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 46]: A legal feud had for some time existed between the Ahab of Moldwarp Hall and the Naboth of the Moat , the descendant of an ancient yeoman family of good blood , and indeed related to the Darylls themselves , of the name of Woodruffe .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 29]: Sir Richard had cast covetous eyes upon the field surrounding Stephen 's comparatively humble abode , which had at one time formed a part of the Moldwarp property .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 63]: In searching through some old parchments , he had found , or rather , I suppose , persuaded himself he had found , sufficient evidence that this part of the property of the Moat , then of considerable size , had been willed away in contempt of the entail which covered it , and belonged by right to himself and his heirs .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 23]: He had therefore instituted proceedings to recover possession , during the progress of which their usual bickerings and disputes augmented in fierceness .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 39]: A decision having at length been given in favour of the weaker party , the mortification of Sir Richard was unendurable to himself , and his wrath and unreasonableness , in consequence , equally unendurable to his family .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 44]: One may then imagine the paroxysm of rage with which he was seized when he discovered that , during the whole of the legal process , his son Wilfrid had been making love to Elizabeth Woodruffe , the only child of his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 56]: In Wilfrid 's letters , the part of the story which follows is fully detailed for Elizabeth 's information , of which the reason is also plain -- that the writer had spent such a brief period afterwards in Elizabeth 's society that he had not been able for very shame to recount the particulars .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 101]: No sooner had Sir Richard come to a knowledge of the hateful fact , evidently through one of his servants , than , suppressing the outburst of his rage for the moment , he sent for his son Wilfrid , and informed him , his lips quivering with suppressed passion , of the discovery he had made ; accused him of having brought disgrace on the family , and of having been guilty of falsehood and treachery ; and ordered him to go down on his knees and abjure the girl before heaven , or expect a father 's vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 16]: But evidently Wilfrid was as little likely as any man to obey such a command .
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 16]: He boldly avowed his love for Elizabeth , and declared his intention of marrying her .
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 14]: His father , foaming with rage , ordered his servants to seize him .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 44]: Overmastered in spite of his struggles , he bound him to a pillar , and taking a horse-whip , lashed him furiously ; then , after his rage was thus in a measure appeased , ordered them to carry him to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 19]: There he remained , hardly able to move , the whole of that night and the next day .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 34]: On the following night , he made his escape from the Hall , and took refuge with a farmer-friend a few miles off -- in the neighbourhood , probably , of Umberden Church .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 32]: Here I would suggest a conjecture of my own -- namely , that my ancestor 's room was the same I had occupied , so -- fatally , shall I say ?
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 80]: -- to myself , on the only two occasions on which I had slept at the Hall ; that he escaped by the stair to the roof , having first removed the tapestry from the door , as a memorial to himself and a sign to those he left ; that he carried with him the sword and the volume -- both probably lying in his room at the time , and the latter little valued by any other .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 11]: But all this , I repeat , is pure conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 63]: As soon as he was sufficiently recovered , he communicated with Elizabeth , prevailed upon her to marry him at once at Umberden Church , and within a few days , as near as I could judge ; left her to join , as a volunteer , the army of the Duke of Cumberland , then fighting the French in the Netherlands .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 57]: Probably from a morbid fear lest the disgrace his father 's brutality had inflicted should become known in his regiment , he dropped the surname of Daryll when he joined it ; and -- for what precise reasons I can not be certain -- his wife evidently never called herself by any other name than Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 32]: Very likely she kept her marriage a secret , save from her own family , until the birth of my grandfather , which certainly took place before her husband 's return .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 57]: Indeed I am almost sure that he never returned from that campaign , but died fighting , not unlikely , at the battle of Laffeldt ; and that my grannie 's letters , which I found in the same packet , had been , by the kindness of some comrade , restored to the young widow .
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 35]: When I had finished reading the letters , and had again thrown myself back in the old chair , I began to wonder why nothing of all this should ever have been told me .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 76]: That the whole history should have dropped out of the knowledge of the family , would have been natural enough , had my great-grandmother , as well as my great-grandfather , died in youth ; but that she should have outlived her son , dying only after I , the representative of the fourth generation , was a boy at school , and yet no whisper have reached me of these facts , appeared strange .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 22]: A moment 's reflection showed me that the causes and the reasons of the fact must have lain with my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 43]: I could not but remember how both he and my aunt had sought to prevent me from seeing my grannie alone , and how the last had complained of this in terms far more comprehensible to me now than they were then .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 18]: But what could have been the reasons for this their obstruction of the natural flow of tradition ?
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 23]: They remained wrapped in a mystery which the outburst from it of an occasional gleam of conjectural light only served to deepen .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 27]: The letters lying open on the table before me , my eyes rested upon one of the dates -- the third day of March , 1747 .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 21]: It struck me that this date involved a discrepancy with that of the copy I had made from the register .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 11]: I referred to it , and found my suspicion correct .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 18]: According to the copy , my ancestors were not married until the 15th of January , 1748 .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 25]: I must have made a blunder -- and yet I could hardly believe I had , for I had reason to consider myself accurate .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 21]: If there _ was _ no mistake , I should have to reconstruct my facts , and draw fresh conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 42]: By this time , however , I was getting tired and sleepy and cold ; my lamp was nearly out ; my fire was quite gone ; and the first of a frosty dawn was beginning to break in the east .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 26]: I rose and replaced the papers , reserving all further thought on the matter for a condition of circumstances more favourable to a correct judgment .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 33]: I blew out the lamp , groped my way to bed in the dark , and was soon fast asleep , in despite of insult , mortification , perplexity , and loss .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVIII .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 4]: ONLY A LINK .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 33]: It may be said of the body in regard of sleep as well as in regard of death , ` It is sown in weakness , it is raised in power . '
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 25]: For me , the next morning , I could almost have said , ' I was sown in dishonour and raised in glory . '
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 73]: No one can deny the power of the wearied body to paralyze the soul ; but I have a correlate theory which I love , and which I expect to find true -- that , while the body wearies the mind , it is the mind that restores vigour to the body , and then , like the man who has built him a stately palace , rejoices to dwell in it .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 69]: I believe that , if there be a living , conscious love at the heart of the universe , the mind , in the quiescence of its consciousness in sleep , comes into a less disturbed contact with its origin , the heart of the creation ; whence gifted with calmness and strength for itself , it grows able to impart comfort and restoration to the weary frame .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 48]: The cessation of labour affords but the necessary occasion ; makes it possible , as it were , for the occupant of an outlying station in the wilderness to return to his father 's house for fresh supplies of all that is needful for life and energy .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 19]: The child-soul goes home at night , and returns in the morning to the labours of the school .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 24]: Mere physical rest could never of its own negative self build up the frame in such light and vigour as come through sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 21]: It was from no blessed vision that I woke the next morning , but from a deep and dreamless sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 31]: Yet the moment I became aware of myself and the world , I felt strong and courageous , and I began at once to look my affairs in the face .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 29]: Concerning that which was first in consequence , I soon satisfied myself : I could not see that I had committed any serious fault in the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 50]: I was not at all sure that a lie in defence of the innocent , and to prevent the knowledge of what no one had any right to know , was wrong -- seeing such involves no injustice on the one side , and does justice on the other .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 57]: I have seen reason since to change my mind , and count my liberty restricted to silence -- not extending , that is , to the denial or assertion of what the will of God , inasmuch as it exists or does not exist , may have declared to be or not to be the fact .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 22]: I now think that to lie is , as it were , to snatch the reins out of God 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 14]: At all events , however , I had done the Brothertons no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 36]: ` What matter , then , ' I said to myself , ` of what they believe me guilty , so long as before God and my own conscience I am clear and clean ? '
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 13]: Next came the practical part : -- What was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 33]: To right myself either in respect of their opinion , or in respect of my lost property , was more hopeless than important , and I hardly wasted two thoughts upon that .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 60]: But I could not remain where I was , and soon came to the resolution to go with Charley to London at once , and taking lodgings in some obscure recess near the Inns of Court , there to give myself to work , and work alone , in the foolish hope that one day fame might buttress reputation .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 33]: In this resolution I was more influenced by the desire to be near the brother of Mary Osborne than the desire to be near my friend Charley , strong as that was .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 36]: I expected thus to hear of her oftener , and even cherished the hope of coming to hear from her -- of inducing her to honour me with a word or two of immediate communication .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 50]: For I could see no reason why her opinions should prevent her from corresponding with one who , whatever might or might not seem to him true , yet cared for the truth , and must treat with respect every form in which he could descry its predominating presence .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 66]: I would have asked Charley to set out with me that very day , but for the desire to clear up the discrepancy between the date of my ancestor 's letters , all written within the same year , and that of the copy I had made of the registration of their marriage -- with which object I would compare the copy and the original .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 25]: I wished also to have some talk with Mr Coningham concerning the contents of the letters which at his urgency I had now read .
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 52]: I got up and wrote to him therefore , asking him to ride with me again to Umberden Church , as soon as he could make it convenient , and sent Styles off at once on the mare to carry the note to Minstercombe , and bring me back an answer .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 24]: As we sat over our breakfast , Charley said suddenly , ` Clara was regretting yesterday that she had not seen the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 17]: She said you had asked her once , but had never spoken of it again . '
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 41]: ` And now I suppose she thinks , because I 'm in disgrace with her friends at the Hall , that she must n't come near me , ' I said , with another bitterness than belonged to the words .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 4]: ` Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 14]: he said reproachfully ; ` she did n't say anything of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 15]: I will write and ask her if she could n't contrive to come over .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 10]: She might meet us at the park gates . '
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 13]: ` No , ' I returned ; ` there is n't time .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 12]: I mean to go back to London -- perhaps to-morrow evening .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 26]: It is like turning you out , Charley , but we shall be nearer each other in town than we were last time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 12]: I am delighted to hear it , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 14]: I had been thinking myself that I had better go back this evening .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 26]: My father is expected home in a day or two , and it would be just like him to steal a march on my chambers .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 10]: Yes , I think I shall go to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 11]: ` Very well , old boy , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 8]: ` That will make it all right .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 19]: It 's a pity we could n't take the journey together , but it does n't matter much .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 11]: I shall follow you as soon as I can . '
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 10]: ` Why ca n't you go with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 51]: Thereupon I gave him a full report of my excursion with Mr Coningham , and the after reading of the letters , with my reason for wishing to examine the register again ; telling him that I had asked Mr Coningham to ride with me once more to Umberden Church .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 55]: When Styles returned , he informed me that Mr Coningham at first proposed to ride back with him , but probably bethinking himself that another sixteen miles would be too much for my mare , had changed his mind and sent me the message that he would be with me early the next day .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 18]: After Charley was gone , I spent the evening in a thorough search of the old bureau .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 58]: I found in it several quaint ornaments besides those already mentioned , but only one thing which any relation to my story would justify specific mention of -- namely , an ivory label , discoloured with age , on which was traceable the very number Sir Giles had read from the scabbard of Sir Wilfrid 's sword .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 34]: Clearly , then , my sword was the one mentioned in the book , and as clearly it had not been at Moldwarp Hall for a long time before I lost it there .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 58]: If I were in any fear as to my reader 's acceptance of my story , I should rejoice in the possession of that label more than in the restoration of sword or book ; but amidst all my troubles , I have as yet been able to rely upon her justice and her knowledge of myself .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 44]: Yes -- I must mention one thing more I found -- a long , sharp-pointed , straight-backed , snake-edged Indian dagger , inlaid with silver -- a fierce , dangerous , almost venomous-looking weapon , in a curious case of old green morocco .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 13]: It also may have once belonged to the armoury of Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 27]: I took it with me when I left my grannie 's room , and laid it in the portmanteau I was going to take to London .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 42]: My only difficulty was what to do with Lilith ; but I resolved for the mean time to leave her , as before , in the care of Styles , who seemed almost as fond of her as I was myself .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIX .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 3]: A DISCLOSURE .
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 19]: Mr Coningham was at my door by ten o'clock , and we set out together for Umberden Church .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 7]: It was a cold clear morning .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 15]: The dying Autumn was turning a bright thin defiant face upon the conquering Winter .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 14]: I was in great spirits , my mind being full of Mary Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 64]: At one moment I saw but her own ordinary face , only what I had used to regard as dulness I now interpreted as the possession of her soul in patience ; at another I saw the glorified countenance of my Athanasia , knowing that , beneath the veil of the other , this , the real , the true face ever lay .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 37]: Once in my sight the frost-clung flower had blossomed ; in full ideal of glory it had shone for a moment , and then folding itself again away , had retired into the regions of faith .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 62]: And while I knew that such could dawn out of such , how could I help hoping that from the face of the universe , however to my eyes it might sometimes seem to stare like the seven-days dead , one morn might dawn the unspeakable face which even Moses might not behold lest he should die of the great sight ?
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 40]: The keen air , the bright sunshine , the swift motion -- all combined to raise my spirits to an unwonted pitch ; but it was a silent ecstasy , and I almost forgot the presence of Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 10]: When he spoke at last , I started . '
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 24]: I thought from your letter you had something to tell me , Mr Cumbermede , ' he said , coming alongside of me .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 7]: ` Yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 15]: I have been reading my grannie 's papers , as I told you . '
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 12]: I recounted the substance of what I had found in them .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 22]: ` Does it not strike you as rather strange that all this should have been kept a secret from you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 29]: ` Very few know anything about their grandfathers , ' I said ; ` so I suppose very few fathers care to tell their children about them . '
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 17]: ` That is because there are so few concerning whom there is anything worth telling . '
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 35]: ` For my part , ' I returned , ' I should think any fact concerning one of those who link me with the infinite past out of which I have come , invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 33]: Even a fact which is not to the credit of an ancestor may be a precious discovery to the man who has in himself to fight the evil derived from it . '
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 13]: ` That , however , is a point of view rarely taken .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 37]: What the ordinary man values is also rare ; hence few regard their ancestry , or transmit any knowledge they may have of those who have gone before them to those that come after them . '
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 36]: ` My uncle , however , I suppose , told _ me _ nothing because , unlike the many , he prized neither wealth nor rank , nor what are commonly considered great deeds . '
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 19]: ` You are not far from the truth there , ' said Mr Coningham in a significant tone .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 14]: ` Then _ you _ know why he never told me anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 4]: I exclaimed . '
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 9]: I do -- from the best authority . '
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 12]: ` His own , you mean , I suppose . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 4]: I do . '
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 25]: ` But -- but -- I did n't know you were ever -- at all -- intimate with my uncle , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 4]: He laughed knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 26]: ` You would say , if you did n't mind speaking the truth , that you thought your uncle disliked me -- disapproved of me .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 14]: Come , now -- did he not try to make you avoid me ?
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 34]: You need n't mind acknowledging the fact , for , when I have explained the reason of it , you will see that it involves no discredit to either of us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 9]: I have no fear for my uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 14]: ` You are honest , if not over-polite , ' he rejoined . '
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 11]: -- You do not feel so sure about my share .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 14]: Well , I do n't mind who knows it , for my part .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 32]: I roused the repugnance , to the knowledge of which your silence confesses , merely by acting as any professional man ought to have acted -- and with the best intentions .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 43]: At the same time , all the blame I should ever think of casting upon him is that he allowed his high-strung , saintly , I had almost said superhuman ideas to stand in the way of his nephew 's prosperity . '
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 17]: ` Perhaps he was afraid of that prosperity standing in the way of a better . '
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 4]: ` Precisely so .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 5]: You understand him perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 15]: He was one of the best and simplest-minded men in the world . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 10]: I am glad you do him that justice . '
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 26]: ` At the same time I do not think he intended you to remain in absolute ignorance of what I am going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 10]: But , you see , he died very suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 17]: Besides , he could hardly expect I should hold my tongue after he was gone . '
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 29]: ` Perhaps , however , he might expect me not to cultivate your acquaintance , ' I said , laughing to take the sting out of the words .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 23]: ` You can not accuse yourself of having taken any trouble in that direction , ' he returned , laughing also . '
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 64]: I believe , however , ' I resumed , ` from what I can recall of things he said , especially on one occasion , on which he acknowledged the existence of a secret in which I was interested , he did not intend that I should always remain in ignorance of everything he thought proper to conceal from me then . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 6]: I presume you are right .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 47]: I think his conduct in this respect arose chiefly from anxiety that the formation of your character should not be influenced by the knowledge of certain facts which might unsettle you , and prevent you from reaping the due advantages of study and self-dependence in youth .
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 43]: I can not , however , believe that by being open with you I shall now be in any danger of thwarting his plans , for you have already proved yourself a wise , moderate , conscientious man , diligent and painstaking .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 8]: Forgive me for appearing to praise you .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 6]: I had no such intention .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 24]: I was only uttering as a fact to be considered in the question , what upon my honour I thoroughly believe . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 21]: I should be happy in your good opinion , if I were able to appropriate it , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 17]: ` But a man knows his own faults better than his neighbour knows his virtues . '
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 18]: ` Spoken like the man I took you for , Mr Cumbermede , ' he rejoined gravely .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 46]: ` But to return to the matter in hand , ' I resumed ; ` what can there be so dangerous in the few facts I have just come to the knowledge of , that my uncle should have cared to conceal them from me ?
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 38]: That a man born in humble circumstances should come to know that he had distinguished ancestors , could hardly so fill him with false notions as to endanger his relation to the laws of his existence . '
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 10]: ` Of course -- but you are too hasty .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 15]: Those facts are of more importance than you are aware -- involve other facts .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 16]: Moldwarp Hall is _ your _ property , and not Sir Giles Brotherton 's . '
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 12]: ` Then the apple was my own , after all ! '
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 6]: I said to myself exultingly .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 40]: It was a strange fantastic birth of conscience and memory -- forgotten the same moment , and followed by an electric flash -- not of hope , not of delight , not of pride , but of pure revenge .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 22]: My whole frame quivered with the shock ; yet for a moment I seemed to have the strength of a Hercules .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 41]: In front of me was a stile through a high hedge : I turned Lilith 's head to the hedge , struck my spurs into her , and over or through it , I know not which , she bounded .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 63]: Already , with all the strength of will I could summon , I struggled to rid myself of the wicked feeling ; and although I can not pretend to have succeeded for long after , yet by the time Mr Coningham had popped over the stile , I was waiting for him , to all appearance , I believe , perfectly calm .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 15]: He , on the other hand , from whatever cause , was actually trembling .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 10]: His face was pale , and his eye flashing .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 14]: Was it that he had roused me more effectually than he had hoped ?
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 25]: ` Take care , take care , my boy , ' he said , ` or you wo n't live to enjoy your own .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 14]: Permit me the honour of shaking hands with Sir Wilfrid Cumbermede Daryll . '
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 46]: After this ceremonial of prophetic investiture , we jogged away quietly , and he told me a long story about the death of the last proprietor , the degree in which Sir Giles was related to him , and his undisputed accession to the property .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 25]: At that time , he said , my father was in very bad health , and indeed died within six months of it . '
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 33]: I knew your father well , Mr Cumbermede , ' he went on , ' -- one of the best of men , with more spirit , more ambition than your uncle .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 40]: It was _ his _ wish that his child , if a boy , should be called Wilfrid , -- for though they had been married five or six years , their only child was born after his death .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 20]: Your uncle did not like the name , your mother told me , but made no objection to it .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 23]: So you were named after your grandfather , and great-grandfather , and I do n't know how many of the race besides .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 25]: -- When the last of the Darylls died -- ' ` Then , ' I interrupted , ` my father was the heir . '
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 39]: ` No ; you mistake : your uncle was the elder -- Sir David Cumbermede Daryll , of Moldwarp Hall and The Moat , ' said Mr Coningham , evidently bent on making the most of my rights .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 16]: ` He never even told me he was the eldest , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 29]: I always thought , from his coming home to manage the farm when my father was ill , that he was the second of the two sons . '
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 56]: ` On the contrary , he was several years older than your father , but taking more kindly to reading than farming , was sent by his father to Oxford to study for the Church , leaving the farm , as was tacitly understood , to descend to your father at your grandfather 's death .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 27]: After the idea of the Church was abandoned he took a situation , refusing altogether to subvert the order of things already established at the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 19]: So you see you are not to suppose that he kept you back from any of your rights .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 13]: They were his , not yours , while he lived . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 17]: I will not ask , ' I said , ` why he did not enforce them .
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 12]: That is plain enough from what I know of his character .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 16]: The more I think of that , the loftier and simpler it seems to grow .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 27]: He could not bring himself to spend the energies of a soul meant for higher things on the assertion and recovery of earthly rights . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 56]: I rather differ from you there ; and I do not know , ' returned my companion , whose tone was far more serious than I had ever heard it before , ` whether the explanation I am going to offer will raise your uncle as much in your estimation as it does in mine .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 19]: I confess I do not rank such self-denial as you attribute to him so highly as you do .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 9]: On the contrary I count it a fault .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 14]: How could the world go on if everybody was like your uncle ? '
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 37]: ` If everybody was like my uncle , he would have been forced to accept the position , ' I said ; ` for there would have been no one to take it from him . '
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 3]: ` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 15]: But you must not think Sir Giles knew anything of your uncle 's claim .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 8]: He knows nothing of it now . '
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 49]: I had not thought of Sir Giles in connection with the matter -- only of Geoffrey ; and my heart recoiled from the notion of dispossessing the old man who , however misled with regard to me at last , had up till then shown me uniform kindness .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 16]: In that moment I had almost resolved on taking no steps till after his death .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 17]: But Mr Coningham soon made me forget Sir Giles in a fresh revelation of my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 64]: ` Although , ' he resumed , ` all you say of your uncle 's indifference to this world and its affairs is indubitably correct , I do not believe , had there not been a prospect of your making your appearance , that he would have shirked the duty of occupying the property which was his both by law and by nature .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 83]: But he knew it might be an expensive suit -- for no one can tell by what tricks of the law such may be prolonged -- in which case all the money he could command would soon be spent , and nothing left either to provide for your so-called aunt , for whom he had a great regard , or to give you that education , which , whether you were to succeed to the property or not , he counted indispensable .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 36]: He cared far more , he said , about your having such a property in yourself as was at once personal and real , than for your having any amount of property out of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 6]: Expostulation was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 69]: I had previously learned -- from the old lady herself -- the true state of the case , and , upon the death of Sir Geoffrey Daryll , had at once communicated with him -- which placed me in a position for urging him , as I did again and again , considerably to his irritation , to assert and prosecute his claim to the title and estates .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 37]: I offered to take the whole risk upon myself ; but he said that would be tantamount to giving up his personal liberty until the matter was settled , which might not be in his lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 61]: I may just mention , however , that , besides his religious absorption , I strongly suspect there was another cause of his indifference to worldly affairs : I have grounds for thinking that he was disappointed in a more than ordinary attachment to a lady he met at Oxford -- in station considerably above any prospects he had then .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 30]: To return : he was resolved that , whatever might be your fate , you should not have to meet it without such preparation as he could afford you .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 79]: As you have divined , he was most anxious that your character should have acquired some degree of firmness before you knew anything of the possibility of your inheriting a large property and historical name ; and I may appropriate the credit of a negative share in the carrying out of his plans , for you will bear me witness how often I might have upset them by informing you of the facts of the case . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 40]: I am heartily obliged to you , ' I said , ` for not interfering with my uncle 's wishes , for I am very glad indeed that I have been kept in ignorance of my rights until now .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 23]: The knowledge would at one time have gone far to render me useless for personal effort in any direction worthy of it .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 28]: It would have made me conceited , ambitious , boastful : I do n't know how many bad adjectives would have been necessary to describe me . '
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 19]: ` It is all very well to be modest , but I venture to think differently . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 16]: I should like to ask you one question , Mr Coningham , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 8]: ` As many as you please . '
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 31]: ` How is it that you have so long delayed giving me the information which on my uncle 's death you no doubt felt at liberty to communicate ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 56]: I did not know how far you might partake of your uncle 's disposition , and judged that the wider your knowledge of the world , and the juster your estimate of the value of money and position , the more willing you would be to listen to the proposals I had to make . '
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 46]: ` Do you remember , ' I asked , after a canter , led off by my companion , ` one very stormy night on which you suddenly appeared at the Moat , and had a long talk with my uncle on the subject ? '
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 7]: ` Perfectly , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 9]: ` But how did you come to know ?
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 12]: _ He _ did not tell you of my visit ! '
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 4]: ` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 44]: But , listening in my night-gown on the stair , which is open to the kitchen , I heard enough of your talk to learn the object of your visit -- namely , to carry off my skin to make bagpipes with . '
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 15]: He laughed so heartily that I told him the whole story of the pendulum .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 61]: ` On that occasion , ' he said , ' I made the offer to your uncle , on condition of his sanctioning the commencement of legal proceedings , to pledge myself to meet every expense of those , and of your education as well , and to claim nothing whatever in return , except in case of success . '
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 14]: This quite corresponded with my own childish recollections of the interview between them .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 77]: Indeed there was such an air of simple straightforwardness about his whole communication , while at the same time it accounted so thoroughly for the warning my uncle had given me against him , that I felt I might trust him entirely , and so would have told him all that had taken place at the Hall , but for the share his daughter had borne in it , and the danger of discovery to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 3]: CHAPTER L .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 3]: THE DATES .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 34]: I have given , of course , only an epitome of our conversation , and by the time we had arrived at this point we had also reached the gate of the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 36]: Again we fastened up our horses ; again he took the key from under the tombstone ; and once more we entered the dreary little church , and drew aside the curtain of the vestry .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 9]: I took down the volume of the register .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 24]: The place was easy to find , seeing , as I have said , it was at the very end of the volume .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 37]: The copy I had taken was correct : the date of the marriage in the register was January 15 , and it was the first under the 1748 , written at the top of the page .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 26]: I stood for a moment gazing at it ; then my eye turned to the entry before it , the last on the preceding page .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 20]: It bore the date December 13 -- under the general date at the top of the page , 1747 .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 10]: The next entry after it was dated March 29 .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 40]: At the bottom of the page , or cover rather , was the attestation of the clergyman to the number of marriages in that year ; but there was no such attestation at the bottom of the preceding page .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 28]: I turned to Mr Coningham , who had stood regarding me , and , pointing to the book , said : ` Look here , Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 6]: I can not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 26]: Here the date of the marriage is 1748 ; and that of all their letters , evidently written after the marriage , is 1747 . '
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 13]: He looked , and stood looking , but made me no reply .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 8]: In my turn I looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 46]: His face expressed something not far from consternation ; but the moment he became aware that I was observing him , he pulled out his handkerchief , and wiping his forehead with an attempt at a laugh , said : ` How hot it is !
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 8]: Yes ; there 's something awkward there .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 7]: I had n't observed it before .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 6]: I must inquire into that .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 11]: I confess I can not explain it all at once .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 6]: It does certainly seem queer .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 12]: I must look into those dates when I go home . '
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 14]: He was evidently much more discomposed than he was willing I should perceive .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 15]: He always spoke rather hurriedly , but I had never heard him stammer before .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 20]: I was certain that he saw or at least dreaded something fatal in the discrepancy I had pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 16]: As to looking into it when he got home , that sounded very like nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 40]: He pulled out a note-book , however , and said : ' I may just as well make a note of the blunder -- for blunder it must be -- a very awkward one indeed , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 28]: I should think so -- I can not -- but then -- ' He went on uttering disjointed and unfinished expressions , while he made several notes .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 26]: His manner was of one who regards the action he is about as useless , yet would have it supposed the right thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 38]: he said , shutting up his note-book with a slam ; and turning away he strode out of the place -- much , it seemed to me , as if his business there was over for ever .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 16]: I gave one more glance at the volume , and replaced it on the shelf .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 15]: When I rejoined him , he was already mounted and turning to move off .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 13]: ` Wait a moment , Mr Coningham , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 12]: I do n't exactly know where to put the key . '
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 33]: ` Fling it under the gravestone , and come along , ' he said , muttering something more , in which , perhaps , I only fancied I heard certain well-known maledictions .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 25]: By this time my spirits had sunk as much below their natural level as , a little before , they had risen above it .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 30]: But I felt that I must be myself , and that no evil any more than good fortune ought for a moment to perturb the tenor of my being .
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 30]: Therefore , having locked the door deliberately and carefully , I felt about along the underside of the gravestone until I found the ledge where the key had lain .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 23]: I then made what haste I could to mount and follow Mr Coningham , but Lilith delayed the operation by her eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 65]: I gave her the rein , and it was well no one happened to be coming in the opposite direction through that narrow and tortuous passage , for she flew round the corners -- ` turning close to the ground , like a cat when scratchingly she wheels about after a mouse , ' as my old favourite , Sir Philip Sidney , says .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 33]: Notwithstanding her speed , however , when I reached the mouth of the lane , there was Mr Coningham half across the first field , with his coat-tails flying out behind him .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 18]: I would not allow myself to be left in such a discourteous fashion , and gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 17]: Before he had measured the other half of the field , I was up with him .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 22]: ` That mare of yours is a clever one , ' he said , as I ranged alongside of him . '
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 9]: I thought I would give her a breather .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 8]: She has n't enough to do . '
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 15]: ` She 's not breathing so _ very _ fast , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 11]: ` Her wind is as good as her legs . '
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 19]: ` Let 's get along then , for I 've lost a great deal of time this morning .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 13]: I ought to have been at Squire Strode 's an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 18]: How hot the sun is , to be sure , for this time of the year ! '
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 42]: As he spoke , he urged his horse , but I took and kept the lead , feeling , I confess , a little angry , for I could not help suspecting he had really wanted to run away from me .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 16]: I did what I could , however , to behave as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 15]: But he was very silent , and his manner towards me was quite altered .
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 28]: Neither could I help thinking it scarcely worthy of a man of the world , not to say a lawyer , to show himself so much chagrined .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 52]: For my part , having simply concluded that the new-blown bubble hope had burst , I found myself just where I was before-with a bend sinister on my scutcheon , it might be , but with a good conscience , a tolerably clear brain , and the dream of my Athanasia .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 36]: The moment we reached the road , Mr Coningham announced that his way was in the opposite direction to mine , said his good morning , shook hands with me , and jogged slowly away .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 13]: I knew that was not the nearest way to Squire Strode 's .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 37]: I could not help laughing -- he had so much the look of a dog with his tail between his legs , or a beast of prey that had made his spring and missed his game .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 36]: I watched him for some time , for Lilith being pulled both ways -- towards home , and after her late companion -- was tolerably quiescent , but he never cast a glance behind him .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 32]: When at length a curve in the road hid him from my sight , I turned and went quietly home , thinking what the significance of the unwelcome discovery might be .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 56]: If the entry of the marriage under that date could not be proved a mere blunder , of which I could see no hope , then certainly my grandfather must be regarded as born out of wedlock , a supposition which , if correct , would account for the dropping of the _ Daryll _ .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 9]: On the way home I jumped no hedges .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 45]: Having taken my farewell of Lilith , I packed my ` bag of needments , ' locked the door of my uncle 's room , which I would have no one enter in my absence , and set out to meet the night mail .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 3]: CHAPTER LI .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 4]: CHARLEY AND CLARA .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 45]: On my arrival in London , I found Charley waiting for me , as I had expected , and with his help soon succeeded in finding , in one of the streets leading from the Strand to the river , the accommodation I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 13]: There I settled and resumed the labour so long and thanklessly interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 51]: When I recounted the circumstances of my last interview with Mr Coningham , Charley did not seem so much surprised at the prospect which had opened before me as disappointed at its sudden close , and would not admit that the matter could be allowed to rest where it was .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 18]: ` Do you think the change of style could possibly have anything to do with it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 9]: he asked , after a meditative silence . '
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 11]: ` Which change of style do you mean ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 19]: I mean the change of the beginning of the year from March to January , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 8]: ` When did that take place ? '
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 24]: ` Some time about the middle of the last century , ' he replied ; ` but I will find out exactly . '
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 37]: The next night he brought me the information that the January which , according to the old style , would have been that of 1752 was promoted to be the first month of the year 1753 .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 44]: My dates then were , by several years , antecedent to the change , and it was an indisputable anachronism that the January between the December of 1747 and the March of 1748 , should be entered as belonging to the latter year .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 37]: This seemed to throw a little dubious light upon the perplexity ; the January thus entered belonging clearly to 1747 , and , therefore , was the same January with that of my ancestor 's letters .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 50]: Plainly , however , the entry could not stand in evidence , its interpolation at least appeared indubitable , for how otherwise could it stand at the beginning of the new year instead of towards the end of the old , five , years before the change of style ?
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 24]: Also , now I clearly remember that it did look a little crushed between the heading of the year and the next entry .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 47]: It must be a forgery -- and a stupid one as well , seeing the bottom of the preceding page , where there was a small blank , would have been the proper place to choose for it -- that is , under the heading 1747 .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 8]: Could the 1748 have been inserted afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 43]: That did not appear likely , seeing it belonged to all the rest of the entries on the page , there being none between the date in question and March 29 , on the 25th of which month the new year began .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 34]: The conclusion lying at the door was that some one had inserted the marriage so long after the change of style that he knew nothing of the trap there lying for his forgery .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 50]: It seemed probable that , blindly following the letters , he had sought to place it in the beginning of the previous year , but , getting bewildered in the apparent eccentricities of the arrangement of month and year , had at last drawn his bow at a venture .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 20]: Neither this nor any other theory I could fashion did I , however , find in the least satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 26]: All I could be sure of was that here was no evidence of the marriage -- on the contrary , a strong presumption against it .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 28]: For my part , the dream in which I had indulged had been so short that I very soon recovered from the disappointment of the waking therefrom .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 17]: Neither did the blot with which the birth of my grandfather was menaced affect me much .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 22]: My chief annoyance in regard of that aspect of the affair was in being _ so _ related to Geoffrey Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 52]: I can not say how it came about , but I could not help observing that , by degrees , a manifest softening appeared in Charley 's mode of speaking of his father , although I knew that there was not the least approach to a more cordial intercourse between them .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 19]: I attributed the change to the letters of his sister , which he always gave me to read .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 82]: From them I have since classed her with a few others I have since known , chiefly women , the best of their kind , so good and so large-minded that they seem ever on the point of casting aside the unworthy opinions they have been taught , and showing themselves the true followers of Him who cared only for the truth , and yet holding by the doctrines of men , and believing them to be the mind of God .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 64]: In one or two of Charley 's letters to her I ventured to insert a question or two , and her reference to these in her replies to Charley gave me an opportunity of venturing to write to her more immediately , in part defending what I thought the truth , in part expressing all the sympathy I honestly could with her opinions .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 32]: She replied very kindly , very earnestly , and with a dignity of expression as well as of thought which harmonized entirely with my vision of her deeper and grander nature .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 51]: The chief bent of my energies was now to vindicate for myself a worthy position in the world of letters ; but my cherished hope lay in the growth of such an intimacy with Mary Osborne as might afford ground for the cultivation of far higher and more precious ambitions .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 29]: It was not , however , with the design of furthering these that I was now guilty of what will seem to most men a Quixotic action enough .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 13]: ` Your sister is fond of riding -- is she not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 19]: I asked Charley one day , as we sauntered with our cigars on the terrace of the Adelphi .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 20]: ` As fond as one can possibly be who has had so little opportunity , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 20]: I was hoping to have a ride with her and Clara the very evening when that miserable affair occurred .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 22]: The loss of that ride was at least as great a disappointment to me as the loss of the sword . '
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 14]: ` You seem to like my sister , Wilfrid , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 27]: ` At least I care more for her good opinion than I do for any woman 's -- or man 's either , Charley . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 6]: I am so glad ! '
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 3]: he responded .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 11]: ` You like her better than Clara , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 9]: ` Ever so much , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 19]: He looked more pleased than annoyed , I thought -- certainly neither the one nor the other entirely .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 16]: His eyes sparkled , but there was a flicker of darkness about his forehead . '
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 17]: I am very glad , ' he said again , after a moment 's pause . '
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 23]: I thought -- I was afraid -- I had fancied sometimes -- you were still a little in love with Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 9]: ` Not one atom , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 8]: ` She cured me of that quite .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 21]: There is no danger of that any more , ' I added -- foolishly , seeing I intended no explanation .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 7]: ` How do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 7]: he asked , a little uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 12]: I had no answer ready , and a brief silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 6]: The subject was not resumed .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 28]: It may well seem strange to my reader that I had never yet informed him of the part Clara had had in the matter of the sword .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 23]: But , as I have already said , when anything moved me very deeply I was never ready to talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 25]: Somehow , perhaps from something of the cat-nature in me , I never liked to let go my hold of it without good reason .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 85]: Especially I shrank from imparting what I only half comprehended ; and besides , in the present case , the thought of Clara 's behaviour was so painful to me still that I recoiled from any talk about it -- the more that Charley had a kind and good opinion of her , and would , I knew , only start objections and explanations defensive , as he had done before on a similar occasion , and this I should have no patience with .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 10]: I had , therefore , hitherto held my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 87]: There was , of course , likewise the fear of betraying his sister , only the danger of that was small , now that the communication between the two girls seemed at an end for the time ; and if it had not been that a certain amount of mutual reticence had arisen between us , first on Charley 's part and afterwards on mine , I doubt much whether , after all , I should not by this time have told him the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 48]: But the moment I had spoken as above , the strangeness of his look , which seemed to indicate that he would gladly request me to explain myself but for some hidden reason , flashed upon me the suspicion that he was himself in love with Clara .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 14]: The moment the suspicion entered , a host of circumstances crystallized around it .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 55]: Fact after fact flashed out of my memory , from the first meeting of the two in Switzerland down to this last time I had seen them together , and in the same moment I was convinced that the lady I saw him with in the Regent 's Park was no other than Clara .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 17]: But , if it were so , why had he shut me out from his confidence ?
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 59]: Of the possible reasons which suggested themselves , the only one which approached the satisfactory was that he had dreaded hurting me by the confession of his love for her , and preferred leaving it to Clara to cure me of a passion to which my doubtful opinion of her gave a probability of weakness and ultimate evanescence .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 7]: A great conflict awoke in me .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 6]: What ought I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 16]: How could I leave him in ignorance of the falsehood of the woman he loved ?
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 9]: But I could not make the disclosure now .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 14]: I must think about the how and the how much to tell him .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 13]: I returned to the subject which had led up to the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 10]: ` Does your father keep horses , Charley ? '
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 22]: ` He has a horse for his parish work , and my mother has an old pony for her carriage . '
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 10]: ` Is the rectory a nice place ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 19]: I believe it is , but I have such painful associations with it that I hardly know . '
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 25]: The Arab loves the desert sand where he was born ; the thief loves the court where he used to play in the gutter .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 9]: How miserable Charley 's childhood must have been !
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 12]: How _ could _ I tell him of Clara 's falsehood ?
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 13]: ` Why does n't he give Mary a pony to ride ? '
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 12]: ` But I suppose he has n't room for another ? '
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 8]: yes , there 's plenty of room .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 8]: His predecessor was rather a big fellow .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 16]: In fact , the stables are on much too large a scale for a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 9]: I dare say he never thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 29]: I must do my father the justice to say there 's nothing stingy about him , and I believe he loves my sister even more than my mother .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 18]: It certainly would be the best thing he could do for her to give her a pony .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 25]: But she will die of religion -- young , and be sainted in a twopenny tract , and that is better than a pony .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 12]: Her hair does n't curl -- that 's the only objection .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 16]: Some one has remarked that all the good children who die have curly hair . '
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 3]: Poor Charley !
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 8]: Was his mind more healthy , then ?
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 11]: Was he less likely to come to an early death ?
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 16]: Was his want of faith more life-giving than what he considered her false faith ? '
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 25]: I see no reason to fear it , ' I said , with a tremor at my heart as I thought of my dream .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 14]: That night I was sleepless -- but about Charley -- not about Mary .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 5]: What could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 7]: -- what ought I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 11]: Might there be some mistake in my judgment of Clara ?
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 37]: I searched , and I believe searched honestly , for any possible mode of accounting for her conduct that might save her uprightness , or mitigate the severity of the condemnation I had passed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 5]: I could find none .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 19]: At the same time , what I was really seeking was an excuse for saying nothing to Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 78]: I suspect now that , had I searched after justification or excuse for her from love to herself , I might have succeeded in constructing a theory capable of sheltering her ; but , as it was , I failed utterly , and , turning at last from the effort , I brooded instead upon the Quixotic idea already adverted to , grown the more attractive as offering a good excuse for leaving Charley for a little .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 3]: CHAPTER LII .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 6]: LILITH MEETS WITH A MISFORTUNE .
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 38]: The next day , leaving a note to inform Charley that I had run home for a week , I set out for the Moat , carrying with me the best side-saddle I could find in London .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 20]: As I left the inn at Minstercombe in a gig , I saw Clara coming out of a shop .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 54]: I could not stop and speak to her , for , not to mention the opinion I had of her , and the treachery of which I accused her , was I not at that very moment meditating how best to let her lover know that she was not to be depended upon ?
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 13]: I touched the horse with the whip , and drove rapidly past .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 17]: Involuntarily , however , I glanced behind , and saw a white face staring after me .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 16]: Our looks encountering thus , I lifted my hat , but held on my course .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 10]: I could not help feeling very sorry for her .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 15]: The more falsely she had behaved , she was the more to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 9]: She looked very beautiful with that white face .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 12]: But how different was her beauty from that of my Athanasia !
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 44]: Having tried the side-saddle upon Lilith , and found all it wanted was a little change in the stuffing about the withers , I told Styles to take it and the mare to Minstercombe the next morning , and have it properly fitted .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 7]: What trifles I am lingering upon !
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 81]: Lilith is gone to the worms -- no , that I _ do not _ believe : amongst the things most people believe , and I can not , that is one ; but at all events she is dead , and the saddle gone to worms ; and yet , for reasons which will want no explanation to my one reader , I care to linger even on the fringes of this part of the web of my story .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 21]: I wandered about the field and house , building and demolishing many an airy abode , until Styles came back .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 19]: I had told him to get the job done at once , and not return without the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 9]: ` Can I trust you , Styles ? '
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 5]: I said abruptly . '
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 6]: I hope so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 26]: If I may make so bold , I do n't think I was altogether to blame about that book -- ' ` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 5]: I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 6]: Never think of it again .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 8]: Can you keep a secret ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 6]: I can try , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 16]: You 've been a good master to me , I 'm sure , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 12]: ` That I mean to be still , if I can .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 10]: Do you know the parish of Spurdene ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 8]: I was born there , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 6]: that 's not so convenient .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 7]: Do you know the rectory ? '
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 13]: ` Every stone of it , I may say , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 8]: ` And do they know you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 19]: ` Well , it 's some years since I left -- a mere boy , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 33]: I want you , then -- if it be possible -- you can tell best -- to set out with Lilith to-morrow night -- I hope it will be a warm night .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 107]: You must groom her thoroughly , put on the side-saddle and her new bridle , and lead her -- you 're not to ride her , mind -- I do n't want her to get hot -- lead her to the rectory of Spurdene -- and-now here is the point -- if it be possible , take her up to the stable , and fasten her by this silver chain to the ring at the door of it -- as near morning as you safely can to avoid discovery , for she must n't stand longer at this season of the year than can be helped .
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 6]: I will tell you all .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 25]: -- I mean her for a present to Miss Osborne ; but I do not want any one to know where she comes from .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 12]: None of them , I believe , have ever seen her .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 25]: I will write something on a card , which you will fasten to one of the pommels , throwing over all this horsecloth . '
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 13]: I gave him a fine bear-skin I had bought for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 21]: He smiled , and , with evident enjoyment of the spirit of the thing , promised to do his best .
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 14]: Lilith looked lovely as he set out with her late the following night .
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 15]: When he returned the next morning , he reported that everything had succeeded admirably .
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 36]: He had carried out my instructions to the letter ; and my white Lilith had by that time , I hoped , been caressed , possibly fed , by the hands of Mary Osborne herself .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 29]: I may just mention that on the card I had written , or rather printed , the words : ` To Mary Osborne , from a friend . '
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 35]: In a day or two I went back to London , but said nothing to Charley of what I had done -- waiting to hear from him first what they said about it . '
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 6]: I say , Wilfrid ! '
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 43]: he cried , as he came into my room with his usual hurried step , the next morning but one , carrying an open letter in his hand , ` what 's this you 've been doing -- you sly old fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 12]: You ought to have been a prince , by Jove ! '
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 8]: ` What do you accuse me of ?
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 15]: I must know that first , else I might confess to more than necessary .
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 13]: One must be on one 's guard with such as you . '
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 15]: ` Read that , ' he said , putting the letter into my hand .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 6]: It was from his sister .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 13]: One passage was as follows : ' A strange thing has happened .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 31]: A few mornings ago the loveliest white horse was found tied to the stable door , with a side-saddle , and a card on it directed to _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 8]: I went to look at the creature .
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 13]: It was like the witch-lady in Christabel , ` beautiful exceedingly . '
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 10]: I ran to my father , and told him .
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 17]: He asked me who had sent it , but I knew no more than he did .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 30]: He said I could n't keep it unless we found out who had sent it , and probably not then , for the proceeding was as suspicious as absurd .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 42]: To-day he has put an advertisement in the paper to the effect that , if the animal is not claimed before , it will be sold at the horse-fair next week , and the money given to the new school fund .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 28]: I feel as if I could n't bear parting with it , but of course I ca n't accept a present without knowing where it comes from .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 8]: Have you any idea who sent it ?
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 20]: I am sure papa is right about it , as indeed , dear Charley , he always is . '
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 18]: I laid down the letter , and , full of mortification , went walking about the room .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 12]: ` Why did n't you tell me , Wilfrid ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 16]: I thought it better , if you were questioned , that you should not know .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 11]: But it was a foolish thing to do -- very .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 5]: I see it now .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 7]: Of course your father is right .
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 6]: It does n't matter though .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 9]: I will go down and buy her . '
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 9]: ` You had better not appear in it .
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 10]: Go to the Moat , and send Styles . '
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 8]: ` Yes -- that will be best .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 5]: Of course it will .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 11]: When is the fair , do you know ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 7]: I will find out for you .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 23]: I hope some rascal may n't in the mean time take my father in , and persuade him to give her up .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 24]: Why should n't I run down and tell him , and get back poor Lilith without making you pay for your own ? '
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 6]: ` Indeed you sha n't .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 16]: The mare is your sister 's , and I shall lay no claim to her .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 9]: I have money enough to redeem her . '
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 21]: Charley got me information about the fair , and the day before it , I set out for the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 27]: When I reached Minstercombe , having more time on my hands than I knew what to do with , I resolved to walk round by Spurdene .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 22]: It would not be more than ten or twelve miles , and so I should get a peep of the rectory .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 43]: On the way I met a few farmer-looking men on horseback , and just before entering the village saw at a little distance a white creature -- very like my Lilith -- with a man on its back , coming towards me .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 32]: As they drew nearer , I was certain of the mare , and , thinking it possible the rider might be Mr Osborne , withdrew into a thicket on the road-side .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 20]: But what was my dismay to discover that it was indeed my Lilith , but ridden by Geoffrey Brotherton !
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 27]: As soon as he was past , I rushed into the village , and found that the people I had met were going from the fair .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 5]: Charley had been misinformed .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 11]: I was too late : Brotherton had bought my Lilith .
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 21]: Half distracted with rage and vexation , I walked on and on , never halting till I reached the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 12]: Was this man destined to swallow up everything I cared for ?
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 17]: Had he suspected me as the foolish donor , and bought the mare to spite me ?
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 11]: A thousand times rather would I have had her dead .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 26]: Nothing on earth would have tempted me to sell my Lilith but inability to feed her , and then I would rather have shot her .
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 28]: I felt poorer than even when my precious folio was taken from me , for the lowest animal life is a greater thing than a rare edition .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 43]: I did not go to bed at all that night , but sat by my fire or paced about the room till dawn , when I set out for Minstercombe , and reached it in time for the morning coach to London .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 17]: The whole affair was a folly , and I said to-myself that I deserved to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 44]: Before I left , I told Styles , and begged him to keep an eye on the mare , and , if ever he learned that her owner wanted to part with her , to come off at once and let me know .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 20]: He was greatly concerned at my ill-luck , as he called it , and promised to watch her carefully .
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 19]: He knew one of the grooms , he said , a little , and would cultivate his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 31]: I could not help wishing now that Charley would let his sister know what I had tried to do for her , but of course I would not say so .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 21]: I think he did tell her , but I never could be quite certain whether or not she knew it .
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 8]: I wonder if she ever suspected me .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 44]: I have too good reason to fear that she attributed to another the would-be gift ; I believe that , from Brotherton 's buying her , they thought he had sent her -- a present certainly far more befitting his means than mine .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 21]: But I came to care very little about it , for my correspondence with her through Charley , went on .
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 34]: I wondered sometimes how she could keep from letting her father know : that he did not know I was certain , for he would have put a stop to it at once .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 56]: I conjectured that she had told her mother , and that she , fearing to widen the breach between her husband and Charley , had advised her not to mention it to him ; while believing it would do both Charley and me good , she did not counsel her to give up the correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 21]: It must be considered , also , that it was long before I said a word implying any personal interest .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 57]: Before I ventured that , I had some ground for thinking that my ideas had begun to tell upon hers , for , even in her letters to Charley , she had begun to drop the common religious phrases , while all she said seemed to indicate a widening and deepening and simplifying of her faith .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 58]: I do not for a moment imply that she had consciously given up one of the dogmas of the party to which she belonged , but there was the perceptible softening of growth in her utterances , and after that was plain to me , I began to let out my heart to her a little more .
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 52]: About this time also I began to read once more the history of Jesus , asking myself as if on a first acquaintance with it , ` Could it be -- might it not be that , if there were a God , he would visit his children after some fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 9]: If so , is this a likely fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 11]: May it not even be the only right fashion ? '
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 31]: In the story I found at least a perfection surpassing everything to be found elsewhere ; and I was at least sure that whatever this man said must be true .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 11]: If one could only be as sure of the record !
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 36]: But if ever a dawn was to rise upon me , here certainly the sky would break ; here I thought I already saw the first tinge of the returning life-blood of the swooning world .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 56]: The gathering of the waters of conviction at length one morning broke out in the following verses , which seemed more than half given to me , the only effort required being to fit them rightly together : -- Come to me , come to me , O my God ; Come to me everywhere !
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 18]: Let the trees mean thee , and the grassy sod , And the water and the air .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 29]: For thou art so far that I often doubt , As on every side I stare , Searching within , and looking without , If thou art anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 10]: How did men find thee in days of old ?
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 7]: How did they grow so sure ?
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 20]: They fought in thy name , they were glad and bold , They suffered , and kept themselves pure .
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 34]: But now they say -- neither above the sphere , Nor down in the heart of man , But only in fancy , ambition , or fear , The thought of thee began .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 27]: If only that perfect tale were true Which , with touch of sunny gold , Of the ancient many makes one anew , And simplicity manifold .
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 65]: But _ he _ said that they who did his word The truth of it should know : I will try to do it -- if he be Lord , Perhaps the old spring will flow ; Perhaps the old spirit-wind will blow That he promised to their prayer ; And doing thy will , I yet shall know Thee , Father , everywhere !
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 48]: These lines found their way without my concurrence into a certain religious magazine , and I was considerably astonished , and yet more pleased , one evening when Charley handed me , with the kind regards of his sister , my own lines , copied by herself .
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 22]: I speedily let her know they were mine , explaining that they had found their way into print without my cognizance .
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 43]: She testified so much pleasure at the fact , and the little scraps I could claim as my peculiar share of the contents of Charley 's envelopes grew so much more confiding that I soon ventured to write more warmly than hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 25]: A period longer than usual passed before she wrote again , and when she did she took no express notice of my last letter .
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 32]: Foolishly or not , I regarded this as a favourable sign , and wrote several letters , in which I allowed the true state of my feelings towards her to appear .
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 31]: At length I wrote a long letter in which , without a word of direct love-making , I thought yet to reveal that I loved her with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 27]: It was chiefly occupied with my dream on that memorable night -- of course without the slightest allusion to the waking , or anything that followed .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 38]: I ended abruptly , telling her that the dream often recurred , but as often as it drew to its lovely close , the lifted veil of Athanasia revealed ever and only the countenance of Mary Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 12]: The answer to this came soon and in few words . '
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 10]: I dare not take to myself what you write .
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 12]: That would be presumption indeed , not to say wilful self-deception .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 23]: It will be honour enough for me if in any way I serve to remind you of the lady in your dream .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 13]: Wilfrid , if you love me , take care of my Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 6]: I must not write more .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 15]: -- M.O. ' It was not much , but enough to make me happy .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 31]: I write it from memory -- every word as it lies where any moment I could read it -- shut in a golden coffin whose lid I dare not open .
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIII .
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 3]: TOO LATE .
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 8]: I must now go back a little .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 43]: After my suspicions had been aroused as to the state of Charley 's feelings , I hesitated for a long time before I finally made up my mind to tell him the part Clara had had in the loss of my sword .
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 80]: But while I was thus restrained by dread of the effect the disclosure would have upon him if my suspicions were correct , those very suspicions formed the strongest reason for acquainting him with her duplicity ; and , although I was always too ready to put off the evil day so long as doubt supplied excuse for procrastination , I could not have let so much time slip by and nothing said but for my absorption in Mary .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 65]: At length , however , I had now resolved , and one evening , as we sat together , I took my pipe from my mouth , and , shivering bodily , thus began : ` Charley , ' I said , ' I have had for a good while something on my mind , which I can not keep from you longer . '
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 5]: He looked alarmed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 5]: I went on . '
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 16]: I have not been quite open with you about that affair of the sword . '
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 19]: He looked yet more dismayed ; but I must go on , though it tore my very heart .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 83]: When I came to the point of my overhearing Clara talking to Brotherton , he started up , and , without waiting to know the subject of their conversation , came close up to me , and , his face distorted with the effort to keep himself quiet , said , in a voice hollow and still and far-off , like what one fancies of the voice of the dead : ` Wilfrid , you said Brotherton , I think ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 6]: I did , Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 8]: ` She never told me that ! '
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 12]: ` How could she when she was betraying your friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 5]: ` No no ! '
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 18]: he cried , with a strange mixture of command and entreaty ; ` do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 5]: There is some explanation .
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 7]: There _ must _ be . '
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 15]: ` She told _ me _ she hated him , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 8]: _ I know _ she hates him .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 9]: What was she saying to him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 38]: I tell you she was betraying me , your friend , who had never done her any wrong , to the man she had told me she hated , and whom I had heard her ridicule . '
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 10]: ` What do you mean by betraying you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 7]: I recounted what I had overheard .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 17]: He listened with clenched teeth and trembling white lips ; then burst into a forced laugh .
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 7]: ` What a fool I am !
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 4]: Distrust _ her !
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 7]: _ I will _ not _ .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 5]: There is some explanation !
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 7]: There _ must _ be ! '
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 10]: The dew of agony lay thick on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 17]: I was greatly alarmed at what I had done , but I could not blame myself .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 12]: ` Do be calm , Charley , ' I entreated . '
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 21]: I am as calm as death , ' he replied , striding up and down the room with long strides .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 9]: He stopped and came up to me again .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 14]: ` Wilfrid , ' he said , ' I am a damned fool .
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 5]: I am going now .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 10]: Do n't be frightened -- I am perfectly calm .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 23]: I will come and explain it all to you to-morrow -- no -- the next day -- or the next at latest .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 22]: She had some reason for hiding it from me , but I shall have it all the moment I ask her .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 8]: She is not what you think her .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 25]: I do n't for a moment blame you -- but -- are you sure it was -- Clara 's -- voice you heard ? '
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 10]: he added with forced calmness and slow utterance . '
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 21]: A man is not likely to mistake the voice of a woman he ever fancied himself in love with . '
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 9]: ` Do n't talk like that , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 6]: You 'll drive me mad .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 11]: How should she know you had taken the sword ? '
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 10]: ` She was always urging me to take it .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 9]: There lies the main sting of the treachery .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 12]: But I never told you where I found the sword . '
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 12]: ` What can that have to do with it ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 13]: I found it on my bed that same morning when I woke .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 12]: It could not have been there when I lay down . '
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 13]: ` Charley , I believe _ she _ laid it there . '
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 8]: He leaped at me like a tiger .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 8]: Startled , I jumped to my feet .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 17]: He laid hold of me by the throat , and griped me with a quivering grasp .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 26]: Recovering my self-possession , I stood perfectly still , making no effort even to remove his hand , although it was all but choking me .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 25]: In a moment or two he relaxed his hold , burst into tears , took up his hat , and walked to the door .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 3]: ` Charley !
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 2]: Charley !
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 16]: you must _ not _ leave me so , ' I cried , starting forwards .
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 15]: ` To-morrow , Wilfrid ; to-morrow , ' he said , and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 12]: He was back before I could think what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 36]: Opening the door half way , he said -- as if a griping hand had been on _ his _ throat -- ` I -- I -- I -- do n't believe it , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 7]: You only said you believed it .
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 6]: _ I _ do n't .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 3]: Good night .
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 6]: I 'm all right now .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 9]: _ Mind , I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 8]: _ ' He , shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 7]: Why did I not follow him ?
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 15]: But if I had followed him , what could I have said or done ?
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 21]: In every man 's life come awful moments when he must meet his fate -- dree his weird -- alone .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 31]: Alone , I say , if he have no God -- for man or woman can not aid him , can not touch him , can not come near him .
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 16]: Charley was now in one of those crises , and I could not help him .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 20]: Death is counted an awful thing : it seems to me that life is an infinitely more awful thing .
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 33]: In the morning I received the following letter : -- ` Dear Mr Cumbermede , ` You will be surprised at receiving a note from me -- still more at its contents .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 29]: I am most anxious to see you -- so much so that I venture to ask you to meet me where we can have a little quiet talk .
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 39]: I am in London , and for a day or two sufficiently my own mistress to leave the choice of time and place with you -- only let it be when and where we shall not be interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 27]: I presume on old friendship in making this extraordinary request , but I do not presume in my confidence that you will not misunderstand my motives .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 20]: One thing only I _ beg _ -- that you will not inform C.O. of the petition I make .
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 14]: ` Your old friend , ` C.C. ' What was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 6]: To go , of course .
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 17]: She _ might _ have something to reveal which would cast light on her mysterious conduct .
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 28]: I can not say I expected a disclosure capable of removing Charley 's misery , but I did vaguely hope to learn something that might alleviate it .
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 16]: Anyhow , I would meet her , for I dared not refuse to hear her .
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 26]: To her request of concealing it from Charley , I would grant nothing beyond giving it quarter until I should see whither the affair tended .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 13]: I wrote at once -- making an appointment for the same evening .
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 57]: But was it from a suggestion of Satan , from an evil impulse of human spite , or by the decree of fate , that I fixed on that part of the Regent 's Park in which I had seen him and the lady I now believed to have been Clara walking together in the dusk ?
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 6]: I can not now tell .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 40]: The events which followed have destroyed all certainty , but I fear it was a flutter of the wings of revenge , a shove at the spokes of the wheel of time to hasten the coming of its circle .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 50]: Anxious to keep out of Charley 's way -- for the secret would make me wretched in his presence -- I went into the City , and , after an early dinner , sauntered out to the Zoological Gardens , to spend the time till the hour of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 42]: But there , strange to say , whether from insight or fancy , in every animal face I saw such gleams of a troubled humanity that at last I could bear it no longer , and betook myself to Primrose Hill .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 18]: It was a bright afternoon , wonderfully clear , with a crisp frosty feel in the air .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 49]: But the sun went down , and one by one , here and there , above and below , the lights came out and the stars appeared , until at length sky and earth were full of flaming spots , and it was time to seek our rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 15]: I had hardly reached it when the graceful form of Clara glided towards me .
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 16]: She perceived in a moment that I did not mean to shake hands with her .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 19]: It was not so dark but that I saw her bosom heave and a flush overspread her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 15]: ` You wished to see me , Miss Coningham , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 7]: I am at your service . '
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 8]: ` What is wrong , Mr Cumbermede ?
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 13]: You never used to speak to me in such a tone . '
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 20]: ` There is nothing wrong if you are not more able than I to tell what it is . '
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 15]: ` Why did you come if you were going to treat me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 7]: ` Because you requested it . '
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 15]: ` Have I offended you , then , by asking you to meet me ?
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 4]: I trusted you .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 12]: I thought _ you _ would never misjudge me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 18]: I should be but too happy to find I had been unjust to you , Miss Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 24]: I would gladly go on my knees to you to confess that fault , if I could only be satisfied of its existence .
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 12]: Assure me of it , and I will bless you . '
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 6]: ` How strangely you talk !
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 8]: Some one has been maligning me . '
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 4]: ` No one .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 19]: But I have come to the knowledge of what only one besides yourself could have told me . '
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 11]: ` You mean -- ' ` Geoffrey Brotherton . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 3]: _ He !
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 14]: _ He has been telling you -- ' ` No -- thank heaven !
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 15]: I have not yet sunk to the slightest communication with _ him _ . '
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 6]: She turned her face aside .
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 18]: Veiled as it was by the gathering gloom , she yet could not keep it towards me .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 28]: But after a brief pause she looked at me and said , ` You know more than -- I do not know what you mean . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 10]: I do know more than you think I know .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 14]: I will tell you under what circumstances I came to such knowledge . '
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 4]: She stood motionless .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 28]: ` One evening , ' I went on , ` after leaving Moldwarp Hall with Charles Osborne , I returned to the library to fetch a book .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 16]: As I entered the room where it lay , I heard voices in the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 16]: One was the voice of Geoffrey Brotherton -- a man you told me you hated .
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 6]: The other was yours . '
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 11]: She drew herself up , and stood stately before me .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 7]: ` Is that your accusation ? '
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 16]: ` Is a woman never to speak to a man because she detests him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 7]: She laughed -- I thought drearily .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 19]: ` Apparently not -- for then I presume you would not have asked me to meet you . '
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 12]: ` Why should you think I hate _ you _ ? '
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 10]: ` Because you have been treacherous to me . '
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 7]: ` In talking to Geoffrey Brotherton ?
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 5]: I do hate him .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 7]: I hate him more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 11]: I spoke the truth when I told you that . '
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 9]: ` Then you do not hate me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 20]: ` And yet you delivered me over to my enemy bound hand and foot , as Delilah did Samson .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 10]: -- I heard what you said to Brotherton . '
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 17]: She seemed to waver , but stood -- speechless , as if waiting for more . '
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 59]: I heard you tell him that I had taken that sword -- the sword you had always been urging me to take -- the sword you unsheathed and laid on my bed that I might be tempted to take it -- why I can not understand , for I never did you a wrong to my poor knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 44]: I fell into your snare , and you made use of the fact you had achieved to ruin my character , and drive me from the house in which I was foolish enough to regard myself as conferring favours rather than receiving them .
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 27]: You have caused me to be branded as a thief for taking -- at your suggestion -- that which was and still is my own ! '
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 7]: ` Does Charley know this ? '
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 9]: she asked , in a strangely altered voice .
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 4]: ` He does .
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 7]: He learned it yesterday . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 5]: O my God ! '
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 13]: she cried , and fell kneeling on the grass at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 3]: ` Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 2]: Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 6]: I will tell you all .
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 17]: It was to tell you all about this very thing that I asked you to come .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 7]: I could not bear it longer .
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 7]: Only your tone made me angry .
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 10]: I did not know you knew so much . '
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 38]: The very fancy of such submission from such a creature would have thrilled me with a wild compassion once ; but now I thought of Charley and felt cold to her sorrow as well as her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 32]: When she lifted her eyes to mine , however -- it was not so dark but I could see their sadness -- I began to hope a little for my friend .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 8]: I took her hand and raised her .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 8]: She was now weeping with down-bent head .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 9]: ` Clara , you shall tell me all .
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 9]: God forbid I should be hard upon you !
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 9]: But you know I can not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 7]: I have no clue to it .
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 8]: How could you serve me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 26]: ` It is very hard for me -- but there is no help now : I must confess disgrace , in order to escape infamy .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 14]: Listen to me , then -- as kindly as you can , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 17]: I beg your pardon ; I have no right to use any old familiarity with you .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 25]: Had my father 's plans succeeded , I should still have had to make an apology to you , but under what different circumstances !
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 9]: I will be as brief as I can .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 11]: My father believed you the rightful heir to Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 26]: Your own father believed it , and made my father believe it -- that was in case your uncle should leave no heir behind him .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 28]: But your uncle was a strange man , and would neither lay claim to the property himself , nor allow you to be told of your prospects .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 39]: He did all he could to make you , like himself , indifferent to worldly things ; and my father feared you would pride yourself on refusing to claim your rights , unless some counter-influence were used . '
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 15]: ` But why should your father have taken any trouble in the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 37]: ` Well , you know -- one in his profession likes to see justice done ; and , besides , to conduct such a case must , of course , be of professional advantage to him .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 27]: You must not think him under obligation to the present family : my grandfather held the position he still occupies before they came into the property .
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 12]: -- I am too unhappy to mind what I say now .
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 21]: My father was pleased when you and I -- indeed I fancy he had a hand in our first meeting .
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 11]: But while your uncle lived he had to be cautious .
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 10]: Chance , however , seemed to favour his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 37]: We met more than once , and you liked me , and my father thought I might wake you up to care about your rights , and -- and -- but -- ' ' I see .
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 47]: And it might have been , Clara , but for -- ' ` Only , you see , Mr Cumbermede , ' she interrupted with a half-smile , and a little return of her playful manner -- ' _ I _ did n't wish it . '
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 12]: You preferred the man who _ had _ the property . '
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 9]: It was a speech both cruel and rude .
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 14]: She stepped a pace back , and looked me proudly in the face .
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 10]: Prefer that man to _ you _ , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 10]: I could never have fallen so low as that .
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 58]: But I confess I did n't mind letting papa understand that Mr Brotherton was polite to me -- just to keep him from urging me to -- to -- You _ will _ do me the justice that I did not try to make you -- to make you -- care for me , Wilfrid ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 5]: I admit it heartily .
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 23]: I will be as honest as you , and confess that you might have done so -- easily enough at one time .
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 20]: Indeed I am only half honest after all : I loved you once -- after a boyish fashion . '
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 6]: She half smiled again . '
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 13]: I am glad you are believing me now , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 7]: ` Thoroughly , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 14]: ` When you speak the truth , I must believe you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 13]: I was afraid to let papa know the real state of things .
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 21]: I was always afraid of him , though I love him dearly , and he is very good to me .
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 14]: I dared not disappoint him by telling him that I loved Charley Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 20]: That time -- you remember -- when we met in Switzerland , his strange ways interested me so much !
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 15]: I was only a girl -- but -- ' ' I understand well enough .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 15]: I do n't wonder at any woman falling in love with my Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 22]: ` Thank you , ' she said , with a sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 6]: ` You were always generous .
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 16]: You will do what you can to right me with Charley -- wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 8]: He is very strange sometimes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 4]: I will indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 22]: But , Clara , why did n't Charley let _ me _ know that you and he loved each other ? '
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 7]: there my shame comes in again !
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 45]: I wanted -- for my father 's sake , not for my own -- I need not tell you that -- I wanted to keep my influence over you a little while -- that is , until I could gain my father 's end .
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 40]: If I should succeed in rousing you to enter an action for the recovery of your rights , I thought my father might then be reconciled to my marrying Charley instead -- ' ` Instead of me , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 5]: Yes -- I see .
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 8]: I begin to understand the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 15]: It 's not so bad as I thought -- not by any means . '
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 5]: ` Oh , Wilfrid !
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 5]: how good of you !
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 12]: I shall love you next to Charley all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 22]: She caught hold of my hand , and for a moment seemed on the point of raising it to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 17]: ` But I ca n't easily get over the disgrace you have done me , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 37]: Neither , I confess , can I get over your degrading yourself to a private interview with such a beast as I know -- and ca n't help suspecting you knew -- Brotherton to be . '
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 15]: She dropped my hand , and hid her face in both her own . '
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 22]: I did know what he was ; but the thought of Charley made me able to go through with it . '
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 12]: ` With the sacrifice of his friend to his enemy ? '
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 5]: ` It was bad .
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 5]: It was horridly wicked .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 6]: I hate myself for it .
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 16]: But you know I thought it would do you no harm in the end . '
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 11]: ` How much did Charley know of it all ? '
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 4]: ` Nothing whatever .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 7]: How could I trust his innocence ?
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 13]: He 's the simplest creature in the world , Wilfrid . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 8]: I know that well enough . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 11]: I could not confess one atom of it to him .
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 11]: He would have blown up the whole scheme at once .
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 23]: It was all I could do to keep him from telling you of our engagement ; and that made him miserable . '
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 12]: ` Did you tell him I was in love with you ?
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 10]: You knew I was , well enough . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 15]: I dared not do that , ' she said , with a sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 18]: ` He would have vanished -- would have killed himself to make way for you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 9]: I see you understand him , Clara . '
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 19]: ` That will give me some feeble merit in your eyes -- wo n't it , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 14]: ` Still I do n't see quite why you betrayed me to Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 16]: I dare say I should if I had time to think it over . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 41]: I wanted to put you in such a position with regard to the Brothertons that you could have no scruples in respect of them such as my father feared from what he called the over-refinement of your ideas of honour .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 16]: The treatment you must receive would , I thought , rouse every feeling against them .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 15]: But it was not _ all _ for my father 's sake , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 23]: It was , however mistaken , yet a good deal for the sake of Charley 's friend that I thus disgraced myself .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 7]: Can you believe me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 11]: But nothing can wipe out the disgrace to me . '
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 7]: ` The sword was your own .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 11]: Of course I never for a moment doubted that . '
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 10]: ` But they believed I was lying . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 15]: I ca n't persuade myself it signifies greatly what such people think about you .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 5]: I except Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 15]: The rest are -- ' ` Yet you consented to visit them . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 9]: I was in reality Sir Giles 's guest .
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 11]: Not one of the others would have asked me . '
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 6]: ` Not Geoffrey ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 13]: I owe _ him _ nothing but undying revenge for Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 18]: Her eyes flashed through the darkness ; and she looked as if she could have killed him .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 17]: ` But you were plotting against Sir Giles all the time you were his guest ? '
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 6]: ` Not unjustly , though .
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 17]: The property was not his , but yours -- that is , as we then believed .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 32]: As far as I knew , the result would have been a real service to him , in delivering him from unjust possession -- a thing he would himself have scorned .
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 29]: It was all very wrong -- very low , if you like -- but somehow it then seemed simple enough -- a lawful stratagem for the right . '
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 10]: ` Your heart was so full of Charley ! '
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 10]: ` Then you do forgive me , Wilfrid ? '
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 6]: ` With all my soul .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 13]: I hardly feel now as if I had anything to forgive . '
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 12]: I drew her towards me and kissed her on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 17]: She threw her arms round me , and clung to me , sobbing like a child .
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 14]: ` You will explain it all to Charley -- wo n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 28]: she said , as soon as she could speak , withdrawing herself from the arm which had involuntarily crept around her , seeking to comfort her . '
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 7]: I will , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 14]: We were startled by a sound in the clump of trees behind us .
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 23]: Then over their tops passed a wailful gust of wind , through which we thought came the fall of receding footsteps . '
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 13]: I hope we have n't been overheard , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 12]: I shall go at once and tell Charley all about it .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 9]: I will just see you home first . '
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 21]: ` There 's no occasion for that , Wilfrid ; and I 'm sure I do n't deserve it . '
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 7]: ` You deserve a thousand thanks .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 8]: You have lifted a mountain off me .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 6]: I see it all now .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 32]: When your father found it was no use -- ' ` Then I saw I had wronged you , and I could n't bear myself till I had confessed all . '
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 18]: ` Your father is satisfied , then , that the register would not stand in evidence ? '
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 8]: He told me all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 28]: ` He has never said a word to me on the matter ; but just dropped me in the dirt , and let me lie there . '
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 9]: ` You must forgive him too , Wilfrid .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 17]: It was a dreadful blow to him , and it was weeks before he told me .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 11]: We could n't think what was the matter with him .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 52]: You see he had been cherishing the scheme ever since your father 's death , and it was a great humiliation to find he had been sitting so many years on an addled egg , ' she said , with a laugh in which her natural merriment once more peeped out .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 13]: I walked home with her , and we parted like old friends .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 24]: On my way to the Temple I was anxiously occupied as to how Charley would receive the explanation I had to give him .
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 22]: That Clara 's confession would be a relief I could not doubt ; but it must cause him great pain notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 28]: His sense of honour was so keen , and his ideal of womankind so lofty , that I could not but dread the consequences of the revelation .
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 12]: At the same time I saw how it might benefit him .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 38]: I had begun to see that it is more divine to love the erring than to love the good , and to understand how there is more joy over the one than over the ninety and nine .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 85]: If Charley , understanding that he is no divine lover , who loves only so long as he is able to flatter himself that the object of his love is immaculate , should find that he must love Clara in spite of her faults and wrong-doings , he might thus grow to be less despairful over his own failures ; he might , through his love for Clara , learn to hope for himself , notwithstanding the awful distance at which perfection lay removed .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 12]: But as I went I was conscious of a strange oppression .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 16]: It was not properly mental , for my interview with Clara had raised my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 31]: It was a kind of physical oppression I felt , as if the air , which was in reality clear and cold , had been damp and close and heavy .
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 8]: I went straight to Charley 's chambers .
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 15]: The moment I opened the door , I knew that something was awfully wrong .
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 14]: The room was dark -- but he would often sit in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 9]: I called him , but received no answer .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 19]: Trembling , I struck a light , for I feared to move lest I should touch something dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 20]: But when I had succeeded in lighting the lamp , I found the room just as it always was .
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 7]: His hat was on the table .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 7]: He must be in his bed-room .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 14]: And yet I did not feel as if anything alive was near me .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 7]: Why was everything so frightfully still ?
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 23]: I opened the door as slowly and fearfully as if I had dreaded arousing a sufferer whose life depended on his repose .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 40]: There he lay on his bed , in his clothes -- fast asleep , as I thought , for he often slept so , and at any hour of the day -- the natural relief of his much-perturbed mind .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 12]: His eyes were closed , and his face was very white .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 14]: As I looked , I heard a sound -- a drop -- another !
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 7]: There was a slow drip somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 4]: God in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 4]: Could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 9]: I rushed to him , calling him aloud .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 5]: There was no response .
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 5]: It was too true !
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 4]: He was dead .
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 20]: The long snake-like Indian dagger was in his heart , and the blood was oozing slowly from around it .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 16]: I dare not linger over that horrible night , or the horrible days that followed .
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 3]: Such days !
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 3]: such nights !
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 5]: The letters to write !
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 6]: -- The friends to tell !
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 3]: -- Clara !
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 4]: -- His father !
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 4]: -- The police !
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 4]: -- The inquest !
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 20]: * * * * * Mr Osborne took no notice of my letter , but came up at once .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 35]: Entering where I sat with my head on my arms on the table , the first announcement I had of his presence was a hoarse deep broken voice ordering me out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 20]: I obeyed mechanically , took up Charley 's hat instead of my own , and walked away with it .
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 57]: But the neighbours were kind , and although I did not attempt to approach again all that was left of my friend , I watched from a neighbouring window , and following at a little distance , was present when they laid his form , late at night , in the unconsecrated ground of a cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 73]: I may just mention here what I had not the heart to dwell upon in the course of my narrative -- that since the talk about suicide occasioned by the remarks of Sir Thomas Browne , he had often brought up the subject -- chiefly , however , in a half-humorous tone , and from what may be called an aesthetic point of view as to the best mode of accomplishing it .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 79]: For some of the usual modes he expressed abhorrence , as being so ugly ; and on the whole considered -- I well remember the phrase , for he used it more than once -- that a dagger -- and on one of those occasions he took up the Indian weapon already described and said -- ` such as this now , ' -- was ` the most gentleman-like usher into the presence of the Great Nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 61]: As I had , however , often heard that those who contemplated suicide never spoke of it , and as his manner on the occasions to which I refer was always merry , such talk awoke little uneasiness ; and I believe that he never had at the moment any conscious attraction to the subject stronger than a speculative one .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 32]: At the same time , however , I believe that the speculative attraction itself had its roots in the misery with which in other and prevailing moods he was so familiar .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIV .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 2]: ISOLATION .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 24]: After writing to Mr Osborne to acquaint him with the terrible event , the first thing I did was to go to Clara .
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 9]: I will not attempt to describe what followed .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 38]: The moment she saw me , her face revealed , as in a mirror , the fact legible on my own , and I had scarcely opened my mouth when she cried ` He is dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 7]: and fell fainting on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 13]: Her aunt came , and we succeeded in recovering her a little .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 46]: But she lay still as death on the couch where we had laid her , and the motion of her eyes hither and thither , as if following the movements of some one about the room , was the only sign of life in her .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 38]: We spoke to her , but evidently she heard nothing ; and at last , leaving her when the doctor arrived , I waited for her aunt in another room , and told her what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 19]: Some days after , Clara sent for me , and I had to tell her the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 50]: Then , with agony in every word she uttered , she managed to inform me that , when she went in after I had left her at the door that night , she found waiting her a note from Charley ; and this she now gave me to read .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 18]: It contained a request to meet him that evening at the very place which I had appointed .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 11]: It was their customary rendezvous when she was in town .
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 35]: In all probability he was there when we were , and heard and saw -- heard too little and saw too much , and concluded that both Clara and I were false to him .
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 23]: The frightful perturbation which a conviction such as that must cause in a mind like his could be nothing short of madness .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 65]: For , ever tortured by a sense of his own impotence , of the gulf to all appearance eternally fixed between his actions and his aspirations , and unable to lay hold of the Essential , the Causing Goodness , he had clung , with the despair of a perishing man , to the dim reflex of good he saw in her and me .
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 34]: If his faith in that was indeed destroyed , the last barrier must have given way , and the sea of madness ever breaking against it must have broken in and overwhelmed him .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 6]: But oh , my friend !
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 51]: surely long ere now thou knowest that we were not false ; surely the hour will yet dawn when I shall again hold thee to my heart ; yea , surely , even if still thou countest me guilty , thou hast already found for me endless excuse and forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 37]: I can hardly doubt , however , that he inherited a strain of madness from his father , a madness which that father had developed by forcing upon him the false forms of a true religion .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 16]: It is not then strange that I should have thought and speculated much about madness .
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 10]: -- What does its frequent impulse to suicide indicate ?
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 15]: May it not be its main instinct to destroy itself as an evil thing ?
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 47]: May not the impulse arise from some unconscious conviction that there is for it no remedy but the shuffling off of this mortal coil -- nature herself dimly urging through the fumes of the madness to the one blow which lets in the light and air ?
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 138]: Doubtless , if in the mind so sadly unhinged , the sense of a holy presence could be developed -- the sense of a love that loves through all vagaries -- of a hiding-place from forms of evil the most fantastic -- of a fatherly care that not merely holds its insane child in its arms , but enters into the chaos of his imagination , and sees every wildest horror with which it swarms ; if , I say , the conviction of such a love dawned on the disordered mind , the man would live in spite of his imaginary foes , for he would pray against them as sure of being heard as St Paul when he prayed concerning the thorn from which he was not delivered , but against which he was sustained .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 21]: And who can tell how often this may be the fact -- how often the lunatic also lives by faith ?
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 14]: Are not the forms of madness most frequently those of love and religion ?
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 47]: Certainly , if there be a God , he does not forget his frenzied offspring ; certainly he is more tender over them than any mother over her idiot darling ; certainly he sees in them what the eye of brother or sister can not see .
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 47]: But some of them , at least , have not enough of such support to be able to go on living ; and , for my part , I confess I rejoice as often as I hear that one has succeeded in breaking his prison bars .
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 104]: When the crystal shrine has grown dim , and the fair forms of nature are in their entrance contorted hideously ; when the sunlight itself is as blue lightning , and the wind in the summer trees is as ' a terrible sound of stones cast down , or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains ; ' when the body is no longer a mediator between the soul and the world , but the prison-house of a lying gaoler and torturer -- how can I but rejoice to hear that the tormented captive has at length forced his way out into freedom ?
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 21]: When I look behind me , I can see but little through the surging lurid smoke of that awful time .
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 19]: The first sense of relief came when I saw the body of Charley laid in the holy earth .
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 29]: For the earth _ is _ the Lord 's -- and none the less holy that the voice of the priest may have left it without his consecration .
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 36]: Surely if ever the Lord laughs in derision , as the Psalmist says , it must be when the voice of a man would in _ his _ name exclude his fellows from their birthright .
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 26]: O Lord , gather thou the outcasts of thy Israel , whom the priests and the rulers of thy people have cast out to perish .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 15]: I remember for the most part only a dull agony , interchanging with apathy .
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 18]: For days and days I could not rest , but walked hither and thither , careless whither .
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 46]: When at length I would lie down weary and fall asleep , suddenly I would start up , hearing the voice of Charley crying for help , and rush in the middle of the Winter night into the wretched streets there to wander till daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 7]: But I was not utterly miserable .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 22]: In my most wretched dreams I never dreamed of Mary , and through all my waking distress I never forgot her .
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 14]: I was sure in my very soul that she did me no injustice .
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 26]: I had laid open the deepest in me to her honest gaze , and she had read it , and could not but know me .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 10]: Neither did what had occurred quench my growing faith .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 43]: I had never been able to hope much for Charley in this world ; for something was out of joint with him , and only in the region of the unknown was I able to look for the setting right of it .
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 20]: Nor had many weeks passed before I was fully aware of relief when I remembered that he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 59]: And whenever the thought arose that God might have given him a fairer chance in this world , I was able to reflect that apparently God does not care for this world save as a part of the whole ; and on that whole I had yet to discover that he could have given him a fairer chance .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 3]: CHAPTER LV .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 4]: ATTEMPTS AND COINCIDENCES .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 10]: It was months before I could resume my work .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 74]: Not until Charley 's absence was , as it were , so far established and accepted that hope had begun to assert itself against memory ; that is , not until the form of Charley ceased to wander with despairful visage behind me and began to rise amongst the silvery mists before me , was I able to invent once more , or even to guide the pen with certainty over the paper .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 18]: The moment , however , that I took the pen in my hand another necessity seized me .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 23]: Although Mary had hardly been out of my thoughts , I had heard no word of her since her brother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 46]: I dared not write to her father or mother after the way the former had behaved to me , and I shrunk from approaching Mary with a word that might suggest a desire to intrude the thoughts of myself upon the sacredness of her grief .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 7]: Why should she think of me ?
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 40]: Sorrow has ever something of a divine majesty , before which one must draw nigh with bowed head and bated breath : Here I and sorrows sit ; Here is my throne : bid kings come bow to it .
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 26]: But the moment I took the pen in my hand to write , an almost agonizing desire to speak to her laid hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 42]: I dared not yet write to her , but , after reflection , resolved to send her some verses which should make her think of both Charley and myself , through the pages of a magazine which I knew she read .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 31]: Oh , look not on the heart I bring -- It is too low and poor ; I would not have thee love a thing Which I can ill endure .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 30]: Nor love me for the sake of what I would be if I could ; O'er peaks as o'er the marshy flat , Still soars the sky of good .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 34]: See , love , afar , the heavenly man The will of God would make ; The thing I must be when I can , Love now , for faith 's dear sake .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 38]: But when I had finished the lines , I found the expression had fallen so far short of what I had in my feeling , that I could not rest satisfied with such an attempt at communication .
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 27]: I walked up and down the room , thinking of the awful theories regarding the state of mind at death in which Mary had been trained .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 78]: As to the mere suicide , love ever finds refuge in presumed madness ; but all of her school believed that at the moment of dissolution the fate is eternally fixed either for bliss or woe , determined by the one or the other of two vaguely defined attitudes of the mental being towards certain propositions ; concerning which attitudes they were at least right in asserting that no man could of himself assume the safe one .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 20]: The thought became unendurable that Mary should believe that Charley was damned -- and that for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 14]: I must and would write to her , come of it what might .
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 64]: That my Charley , whose suicide came of misery that the painful flutterings of his half-born wings would not bear him aloft into the empyrean , should appear to my Athanasia lost in an abyss of irrecoverable woe ; that she should think of God as sending forth his spirit to sustain endless wickedness for endless torture ; -- it was too frightful .
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 19]: As I wrote , the fire burned and burned , and I ended only from despair of utterance .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 27]: Not a word can I now recall of what I wrote : -- the strength of my feelings must have paralyzed the grasp of my memory .
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 54]: All I can recollect is that I closed with the expression of a passionate hope that the God who had made me and my Charley to love each other , would somewhere , some day , somehow , when each was grown stronger and purer , give us once more to each other .
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 16]: In that hope alone , I said , was it possible for me to live .
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 60]: By return of post I received the following : -- SIR , After having everlastingly ruined one of my children , body and soul , for _ your _ sophisms will hardly alter the decrees of divine justice , once more you lay your snares -- now to drag my sole remaining child into the same abyss of perdition .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 30]: Such wickedness -- wickedness even to the pitch of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost -- I have never in the course of a large experience of impenitence found paralleled .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 35]: It almost drives me to the belief that the enemy of souls is still occasionally permitted to take up his personal abode in the heart of him who wilfully turns aside from revealed truth .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 41]: I forgive you for the ruin you have brought upon our fondest hopes , and the agony with which you have torn the hearts of those who more than life loved him of whom you falsely called yourself the friend .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 23]: But I fear you have already gone too far ever to feel your need of that forgiveness which alone can avail you .
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 15]: Yet I say -- Repent , for the mercy of the Lord is infinite .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 29]: Though my boy is lost to me for ever , I should yet rejoice to see the instrument of his ruin plucked as a brand from the burning .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 7]: Your obedient well-wisher , CHARLES OSBORNE .
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 43]: ` P.S. -- I retain your letter for the sake of my less experienced brethren , that I may be able to afford an instance of how far the unregenerate mind can go in its antagonism to the God of Revelation . '
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 26]: I breathed a deep breath , and laid the letter down , mainly concerned as to whether Mary had had the chance of reading mine .
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 48]: I could believe any amount of tyranny in her father -- even to perusing and withholding her letters ; but in this I may do him injustice , for there is no common ground known to me from which to start in speculating upon his probable actions .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 30]: I wrote in answer something nearly as follows : -- SIR , That you should do me injustice can by this time be no matter of surprise to me .
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 22]: Had I the slightest hope of convincing you of the fact , I should strain every mental nerve to that end .
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 26]: But no one can labour without hope , and as in respect of _ your _ justice I have none , I will be silent .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 43]: May the God in whom I trust convince you of the cruelty of which you have been guilty : the God in whom you profess to believe , must be too like yourself to give any ground of such hope from him .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 9]: Your obedient servant , ` WILFRID CUMBERMEDE . '
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 21]: If Mary had read my letter , I felt assured her reading had been very different from her father 's .
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 16]: Anyhow she could not judge me as he did , for she knew me better .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 16]: She knew that for Charley 's sake I had tried the harder to believe myself .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 35]: But the reproaches of one who had been so unjust to his own son could not weigh very heavily on me , and I now resumed my work with a tolerable degree of calmness .
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 5]: But I wrote badly .
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 16]: I should have done better to go down to the Moat , and be silent .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 42]: If my reader has ever seen what I wrote at that time , I should like her to know that I now wish it all unwritten -- not for any utterance contained in it , but simply for its general inferiority .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 10]: Certainly work is not always required of a man .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 19]: There is such a thing as a sacred idleness , the cultivation of which is now fearfully neglected .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 32]: Abraham , seated in his tent door in the heat of the day , would be to the philosophers of the nineteenth century an object for uplifted hands and pointed fingers .
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 30]: They would see in him only the indolent Arab , whom nothing but the foolish fancy that he saw his Maker in the distance , could rouse to run .
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 38]: It was clearly better to attempt no further communication with Mary at present ; and I could think but of one person from whom , without giving pain , I might hope for some information concerning her .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 37]: * * * * * Here I had written a detailed account of how I contrived to meet Miss Pease , but it is not of consequence enough to my story to be allowed to remain .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 35]: Suffice it to mention that one morning at length I caught sight of her in a street in Mayfair , where the family was then staying for the season , and overtaking addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 17]: She started , stared at me for a moment , and held out her hand . '
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 9]: I did n't know you , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 6]: How much older you look !
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 6]: Have you been ill ? '
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 25]: She spoke hurriedly , and kept looking over her shoulder now and then , as if afraid of being seen talking to me . '
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 23]: I have had a good deal to make me older since we met last , Miss Pease , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 26]: I have hardly a friend left in the world but you -- that is , if you will allow me to call you one . '
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 20]: ` Certainly , certainly , ' she answered , but hurriedly , and with one of those uneasy glances .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 45]: ` Only you must allow , Mr Cumbermede , that -- that -- that -- ' The poor lady was evidently unprepared to meet me on the old footing , and , at the same time , equally unwilling to hurt my feelings . '
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 18]: I should be sorry to make you run a risk for my sake , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 8]: ` Please just answer me one question .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 18]: Do you know what it is to be misunderstood -- to be despised without deserving it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 14]: She smiled sadly , and nodded her head gently two or three times .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 18]: ` Then have pity on me , and let me have a little talk with you . '
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 8]: Again she glanced apprehensively over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 20]: ` You are afraid of being seen with me , and I do n't wonder , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 13]: ` Mr Geoffrey came up with us , ' she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 6]: I left him at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 13]: He will be going across the park to his club directly . '
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 17]: ` Then come with me the other way -- into Hyde Park , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 10]: With evident reluctance , she yielded and accompanied me .
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 13]: As soon as we got within Stanhope Gate , I spoke . '
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 32]: A certain sad event , of which you have no doubt heard , Miss Pease , has shut me out from all communication with the family of my friend Charley Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 11]: I am very anxious for some news of his sister .
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 12]: She is all that is left of him to me now .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 9]: Can you tell me anything about her ? '
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 12]: ` She has been very ill , ' she replied . '
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 13]: I hope that means that she is better , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 23]: ` She is better , and , I hear , going on the Continent , as soon as the season will permit .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 20]: But , Mr Cumbermede , you must be aware that I am under considerable restraint in talking to you .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 46]: The position I hold in Sir Giles 's family , although neither a comfortable nor a dignified one -- ' ' I understand you perfectly , Miss Pease , ' I returned , ` and fully appreciate the sense of propriety which causes your embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 19]: But the request I am about to make has nothing to do with them or their affairs whatever .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 19]: I only want your promise to let me know if you hear anything of Miss Osborne . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 24]: I can not tell -- what -- ' ` What use I may be going to make of the information you give me .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 12]: In a word , you do not trust me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 10]: I neither trust nor distrust you , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 14]: But I am afraid of being drawn into a correspondence with you . '
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 8]: ` Then I will ask no promise .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 7]: I will hope in your generosity .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 5]: Here is my address .
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 27]: I pray you , as you would have helped him who fell among thieves , to let me know anything you hear about Mary Osborne . '
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 22]: She took my card , and turned at once , saying , ` Mind , I make no promise . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 9]: I imagine none , ' I answered . '
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 8]: I will trust in your kindness . '
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 5]: And so we parted .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 14]: Unsatisfactory as the interview was , it yet gave me a little hope .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 18]: I was glad to hear that Mary was going abroad , for it must do her good .
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 11]: For me , I would endure and labour and hope .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 18]: I gave her to God , as Shakspere says somewhere , and set myself to my work .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 18]: When her mind was quieter about Charley , somehow or other I might come near her again .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 7]: -- I could not see how .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 9]: I took my way across the Green Park .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 21]: I do not believe we notice the half of the coincidences that float past us on the stream of events .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 30]: Things which would fill us with astonishment , and probably with foreboding , look us in the face and pass us by , and we know nothing of them .
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 41]: As I walked along in the direction of the Mall , I became aware of a tall man coming towards me , stooping , as if with age , while the length of his stride indicated a more vigorous period .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 30]: He passed without lifting his head , but , in the partial view of the wan and furrowed countenance , I could not fail to recognize Charley 's father .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 21]: Such a worn unhappiness was there depicted that the indignation which still lingered in my bosom went out in compassion .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 28]: If his sufferings might but teach him that to brand the truth of the kingdom with the private mark of opinion must result in persecution and cruelty !
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 71]: He mounted the slope with strides at once eager and aimless , and I wondered whether any of the sure-coming compunctions had yet begun to overshadow the complacency of his faith ; whether he had yet begun to doubt if it pleased the Son of Man that a youth should be driven from the gates of truth because he failed to recognize her image in the faces of the janitors .
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 21]: Aimless also , I turned into the Mall , and again I started at the sight of a known figure .
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 4]: Was it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 14]: -- could it be my Lilith betwixt the shafts of a public cabriolet ?
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 5]: Fortunately it was empty .
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 18]: I hailed it , and jumped up , telling the driver to take me to my chambers .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 4]: My poor Lilith !
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 11]: She was working like one who had never been loved !
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 13]: So far as I knew she had never been in harness before .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 15]: She was badly groomed and thin , but much of her old spirit remained .
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 40]: I soon entered into negotiations with the driver , whose property she was , and made her my own once more , with a delight I could ill express in plain prose -- for my friends were indeed few .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 32]: I wish I could draw a picture of the lovely creature , when at length , having concluded my bargain , I approached her , and called her by her name !
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 27]: She turned her head sideways towards me with a low whinny of pleasure , and when I walked a little away , walked wearily after me .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 15]: I took her myself to livery stables near me , and wrote for Styles .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 9]: His astonishment when he saw her was amusing .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 4]: ` Good Lord !
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 4]: Miss Lilith ! '
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 10]: was all he could say -- for some moments .
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 20]: In a few days she had begun to look like herself , and I sent her home with Styles .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 29]: I should hardly like to say how much the recovery of her did to restore my spirits ; I could not help regarding it as a good omen .
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 35]: And now , the first bitterness of my misery having died a natural death , I sought again some of the friends I had made through Charley , and experienced from them great kindness .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 39]: I began also to go into society a little , for I had found that invention is ever ready to lose the forms of life , if it be not kept under the ordinary pressure of its atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 43]: As it is , I doubt much if any of my books are more than partially true to those forms , for I have ever heeded them too little ; but I believe I have been true to the heart of man .
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 23]: At the same time , I have ever regarded that heart more as the fountain of aspiration than the grave of fruition .
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 69]: The discomfiture of enemies and a happy marriage never seemed to me ends of sufficient value to close a history withal -- I mean a fictitious history , wherein one may set forth joys and sorrows which in a real history must walk shadowed under the veil of modesty ; for the soul , still less than the body , will consent to be revealed to all eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 21]: Hence , although most of my books have seemed true to some , they have all seemed visionary to most .
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 12]: A year passed away , during which I never left London .
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 24]: I heard from Miss Pease -- that Miss Osborne , although much better , was not going to return until after another Winter .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 11]: I wrote and thanked her , and heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 40]: It may seem I accepted such ignorance with strange indifference ; but , even to the reader for whom alone I am writing , I can not , as things are , attempt to lay open all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 60]: I have not written and can not write how I thought , projected , brooded , and dreamed -- all about _ her _ ; how I hoped when I wrote that she might read ; how I questioned what I had written , to find whether it would look to her what I had intended it to appear .
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVI .
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 4]: THE LAST VISION .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 37]: I had engaged to accompany one of Charley 's barrister-friends , in whose society I had found considerable satisfaction , to his father 's house -- to spend the evening with some friends of the family .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 23]: The gathering was chiefly for talk , and was a kind of thing I disliked , finding its aimlessness and flicker depressing .
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 27]: Indeed , partly from the peculiar circumstances of my childhood , partly from what I had suffered , I always found my spirits highest when alone .
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 51]: Still , the study of humanity apart , I felt that I ought not to shut myself out from my kind , but endure some little irksomeness , if only for the sake of keeping alive that surface friendliness which has its value in the nourishment of the deeper affections .
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 49]: On this particular occasion , however , I yielded the more willingly that , in the revival of various memories of Charley , it had occurred to me that I once heard him say that his sister had a regard for one of the ladies of the family .
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 24]: There were not many people in the drawing-room when we arrived , and my friend 's mother alone was there to entertain them .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 19]: With her I was chatting when one of her daughters entered , accompanied by a lady in mourning .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 13]: For one moment I felt as if on the borders of insanity .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 30]: My brain seemed to surge like the waves of a wind-tormented tide , so that I dared not make a single step forward lest my limbs should disobey me .
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 12]: It was indeed Mary Osborne ; but oh , how changed !
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 28]: The rather full face had grown delicate and thin , and the fine pure complexion if possible finer and purer , but certainly more ethereal and evanescent .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 25]: It was as if suffering had removed some substance unapt , -LSB- Footnote : Spenser 's ` Hymne in Honour of Beautie . ' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 11]: and rendered her body a better-fitting garment for her soul .
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 56]: Her face , which had before required the softening influences of sleep and dreams to give it the plasticity necessary for complete expression , was now full of a repressed expression , if I may be allowed the phrase -- a latent something ever on the tremble , ever on the point of breaking forth .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 20]: It was as if the nerves had grown finer , more tremulous , or , rather , more vibrative .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 20]: Touched to finer issues they could never have been , but suffering had given them a more responsive thrill .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 21]: In a word , she was the Athanasia of my dream , not the Mary Osborne of the Moldwarp library .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 15]: Conquering myself at last , and seeing a favourable opportunity , I approached her .
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 31]: I think the fear lest her father should enter gave me the final impulse ; otherwise I could have been contented to gaze on her for hours in motionless silence .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 10]: ` May I speak to you , Mary ? '
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 19]: She lifted her eyes and her whole face towards mine , without a smile , without a word .
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 27]: Her features remained perfectly still , but , like the outbreak of a fountain , the tears rushed into her eyes and overflowed in silent weeping .
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 13]: Not a sob , not a convulsive movement , accompanied their flow .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 7]: ` Is your father here ? '
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 6]: She shook her head . '
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 14]: I thought you were abroad somewhere -- I did not know where . '
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 6]: Again she shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 18]: She dared not speak , knowing that if she made the attempt she must break down . '
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 17]: I will go away till you can bear the sight of me , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 30]: She half-stretched out a thin white hand , but whether to detain me or bid me farewell I do not know , for it dropped again on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 19]: -LSB- Illustration : `` I will come to you by and by , '' I said . -RSB- '
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 15]: I will come to you by-and-by , ' I said , and moved away .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 22]: The rooms rapidly filled , and in a few minutes I could not see the corner where I had left her .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 27]: I endured everything for awhile , and then made my way back to it ; but she was gone , and I could find her nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 6]: A lady began to sing .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 36]: When the applause which followed her performance was over , my friend , who happened to be near me , turned abruptly and said , ` Now , Cumbermede , _ you _ sing . '
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 29]: The truth was that , since I had loved Mary Osborne , I had attempted to cultivate a certain small gift of song which I thought I possessed .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 73]: I dared not touch any existent music , for I was certain I should break down ; but having a faculty -- somewhat thin , I fear -- for writing songs , and finding that a shadowy air always accompanied the birth of the words , I had presumed to study music a little , in the hope of becoming able to fix the melody -- the twin sister of the song .
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 17]: I had made some progress , and had grown able to write down a simple thought .
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 25]: There was little presumption , then , in venturing my voice , limited as was its scope , upon a trifle of my own .
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 61]: Tempted by the opportunity of realizing hopes consciously wild , I obeyed my friend , and , sitting down to the instrument in some trepidation , sang the following verses -- I dreamed that I woke from a dream , And the house was full of light ; At the window two angel Sorrows Held back the curtains of night .
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 28]: The door was wide , and the house Was full of the morning wind ; At the door two armed warders Stood silent , with faces blind .
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 27]: I ran to the open door , For the wind of the world was sweet ; The warders with crossing weapons Turned back my issuing feet .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 28]: I ran to the shining windows -- There the winged Sorrows stood ; Silent they held the curtains , And the light fell through in a flood .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 9]: I clomb to the highest window -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 21]: there , with shadowed brow , Stood one lonely radiant Sorrow , And that , my love , was thou .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 44]: I could not have sung this in public , but that no one would suspect it was my own , or was in the least likely to understand a word of it -- except her for whose ears and heart it was intended .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 18]: As soon as I had finished , I rose , and once more went searching for Mary .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 19]: But as I looked , sadly fearing she was gone , I heard her voice close behind me .
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 11]: ` Are those verses your own , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 8]: she asked , almost in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 4]: I turned trembling .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 9]: Her lovely face was looking up at me .
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 24]: ` Yes , ' I answered -- ` as much my own as that I believe they are not to be found anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 13]: But they were given to me rather than made by me . '
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 8]: ` Would you let me have them ?
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 11]: I am not sure that I understand them . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 10]: I am not sure that I understand them myself .
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 10]: They are for the heart rather than the mind .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 7]: Of course you shall have them .
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 6]: They were written for you .
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 12]: All I have , all I am , is yours . '
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 10]: Her face flushed , and grew pale again instantly .
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 11]: ` You must not talk so , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 5]: ` Remember . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 5]: I can never forget .
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 12]: I do not know why you say _ remember _ . '
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 12]: ` On second thoughts , I must not have the verses .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 6]: I beg your pardon . '
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 7]: ` Mary , you bewilder me .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 20]: I have no right to ask you to explain , except that you speak as if I must understand .
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 10]: What have they been telling you about me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 13]: ` Nothing -- at least nothing that -- ' She paused . '
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 29]: I try to live innocently , and were it only for your sake , shall never stop searching for the thread of life in its ravelled skein . '
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 13]: ` Do not say for _ my _ sake , Mr Cumbermede .
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 4]: That means nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 13]: Say for your own sake , if not for God 's . '
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 24]: ` If _ you _ are going to turn away from me , I do n't mind how soon I follow Charley . '
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 28]: All this was said in a half-whisper , I bending towards her where she sat , a little sheltered by one of a pair of folding doors .
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 26]: My heart was like to break -- or rather it seemed to have vanished out of me altogether , lost in a gulf of emptiness .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 4]: Was this all ?
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 8]: Was this the end of my dreaming ?
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 12]: To be thus pushed aside by the angel of my resurrection ?
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 3]: hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 4]: she said kindly .
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 7]: ` You must have many friends .
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 13]: But -- ' ` But you will be my friend no more ?
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 6]: Is that it , Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 7]: Oh , if you knew all !
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 11]: And you are never , never to know it ! '
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 10]: Her still face was once more streaming with tears .
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 33]: I choked mine back , terrified at the thought of being observed ; and without even offering my hand , left her and made my way through the crowd to the stair .
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 8]: On the landing I met Geoffrey Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 10]: We stared each other in the face and passed .
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 30]: I did not sleep much that night , and when I did sleep , woke from one wretched dream after another , now crying aloud , and now weeping .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 6]: What could I have done ?
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 21]: or rather , what could any one have told her I had done to make her behave thus to me ?
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 30]: She did not look angry -- or even displeased -- only sorrowful , very sorrowful ; and she seemed to take it for granted I knew what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 44]: When at length I finally woke after an hour of less troubled sleep , I found some difficulty in convincing myself that the real occurrences of the night before had not been one of the many troubled dreams that had scared my repose .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 44]: Even after the dreams had all vanished , and the facts remained , they still appeared more like a dim dream of the dead -- the vision of Mary was so wan and hopeless , memory alone looking out from her worn countenance .
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 46]: There had been no warmth in her greeting , no resentment in her aspect ; we met as if we had parted but an hour before , only that an open grave was between us , across which we talked in the voice of dreamers .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 31]: She had sought to raise no barrier between us , just because we _ could _ not meet , save as one of the dead and one of the living .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 5]: What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 10]: But with the growing day awoke a little courage .
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 12]: I would at least try to find out what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 17]: Surely _ all _ my dreams were not to vanish like the mist of the morning !
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 17]: To lose my dreams would be far worse than to lose the so-called realities of life .
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 6]: What were these to me ?
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 7]: What value lay in such reality ?
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 41]: Even God was as yet so dim and far off as to seem rather in the region of dreams -- of those true dreams , I hoped , that shadowed forth the real -- than in the actual visible present .
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 39]: ` Still , ' I said to myself , ` she had not cast me off ; she did not refuse to know me ; she did ask for my song , and I will send it . '
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 41]: I wrote it out , adding a stanza to the verses : -- I bowed my head before her , And stood trembling in the light ; She dropped the heavy curtain , And the house was full of night .
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 9]: I then sought my friend 's chambers . '
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 14]: I was not aware you knew the Osbornes , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 17]: I wonder you never told me , seeing Charley and you were such friends . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 10]: I never saw one of them till last night .
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 18]: My sister and she knew each other some time ago , and have met again of late .
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 7]: What a lovely creature she is !
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 8]: But what became of you last night ?
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 11]: You must have left before any one else . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 7]: I did n't feel well . '
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 10]: ` You do n't look the thing . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 10]: I confess meeting Miss Osborne rather upset me . '
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 9]: ` It had the same effect on her .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 12]: She was quite ill , my sister said , this morning .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 3]: No wonder !
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 3]: Poor Charley !
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 15]: I always had a painful feeling that he would come to grief somehow . '
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 20]: ` Let 's hope he 's come to something else by this time , Marston , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 7]: ` Amen , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 10]: ` Is her father or mother with her ? '
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 16]: They are to fetch her away -- next week , I think it is . '
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 43]: I had now no fear of my communication falling into other hands , and therefore sent the song by post , with a note , in which I begged her to let me know if I had done anything to offend her .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 34]: Next morning I received the following reply : ` No , Wilfrid -- for Charley 's sake , I must call you by your name -- you have done nothing to offend me .
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 6]: Thank you for the song .
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 15]: I did not want you to send it , but I will keep it .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 8]: You must not write to me again .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 10]: Do not forget what we used to write about .
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 7]: God 's ways are not ours .
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 7]: Your friend , Mary Osborne . '
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 10]: I rose and went out , not knowing whither .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 7]: Half-stunned , I roamed the streets .
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 33]: I ate nothing that day , and when towards night I found myself near my chambers , I walked in as I had come out , having no intent , no future .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 12]: I felt very sick , and threw myself on my bed .
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 15]: There I passed the night , half in sleep , half in helpless prostration .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 31]: When I look back , it seems as if some spiritual narcotic must have been given me , else how should the terrible time have passed and left me alive ?
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 26]: When I came to myself , I found I was ill , and I longed to hide my head in the nest of my childhood .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 58]: I had always looked on the Moat as my refuge at the last ; now it seemed the only desirable thing -- a lonely nook , in which to lie down and end the dream there begun -- either , as it now seemed , in an eternal sleep , or the inburst of a dreary light .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 24]: After the last refuge it could afford me it must pass from my hold ; but I was yet able to determine whither .
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 7]: I rose and went to Marston .
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 16]: ` Marston , ' I said , ' I want to make my will . '
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 5]: ` All right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 17]: he returned ; ` but you look as if you meant to register it as well .
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 14]: You 've got a feverish cold ; I see it in your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 26]: I 'll go home with you , and fetch a friend of mine , who will give you something to do you good . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 15]: I ca n't rest till I have made my will , ' I persisted .
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 14]: ` Well , there 's no harm in that , ' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 12]: ` It wo n't take long , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 6]: ` It need n't anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 24]: I only want to leave the small real property I have to Miss Osborne , and the still smaller-personal property to yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 7]: ` All right , old boy !
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 27]: I have n't the slightest objection to your willing your traps to me , but every objection in the world to your _ leaving _ them .
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 26]: To be sure , every , man , with anything to leave , ought to make his will betimes ; -- so fire away . '
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 10]: In a little while the draught was finished . '
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 15]: I shall have it ready for your signature by to-morrow , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 9]: I insisted it should be done at once .
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 8]: I was going home , I said .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 3]: He yielded .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 34]: The will was engrossed , signed , and witnessed that same morning ; and in the afternoon I set out , the first part of the journey by rail , for the Moat .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVII .
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 3]: ANOTHER DREAM .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 41]: The excitement of having something to do had helped me over the morning , and the pleasure of thinking of what I had done helped me through half the journey ; but before I reached home I was utterly exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 18]: Then I had to drive round by the farm , and knock up Mrs Herbert and Styles .
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 28]: I could not bear the thought of my own room , and ordered a fire in my grandmother 's , where they soon got me into bed .
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 11]: All I remember of that night is the following dream .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 10]: I found myself at the entrance of the ice-cave .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 26]: A burning sun beat on my head , and at my feet flowed the brook which gathered its life from the decay of the ice .
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 24]: I stooped to drink ; but , cool to the eye and hand and lips , it yet burned me within like fire .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 11]: I would seek shelter from the sun inside the cave .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 27]: I entered , and knew that the cold was all around me ; I even felt it ; but somehow it did not enter into me .
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 11]: My brain , my very bones , burned with fire .
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 6]: I went in and in .
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 23]: The blue atmosphere closed around me , and the colour entered into my soul till it seemed dyed with the potent blue .
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 14]: My very being swam and floated in a blue atmosphere of its own .
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 54]: My intention -- I can recall it perfectly -- was but to walk to the end , a few yards , then turn and again brave the sun ; for I had a dim feeling of forsaking my work , of playing truant , or of being cowardly in thus avoiding the heat .
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 14]: Something else too was wrong , but I could not clearly tell what .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 18]: As I went on , I began to wonder that I had not come to the end .
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 39]: The gray walls yet rose about me , and ever the film of dissolution flowed along their glassy faces to the runnel below ; still before me opened the depth of blue atmosphere , deepening as I went .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 35]: After many windings , the path began to branch , and soon I was lost in a labyrinth of passages , of which I knew not why I should choose one rather than another .
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 9]: It was useless now to think of returning .
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 12]: Arbitrarily I chose the narrowest way , and still went on .
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 22]: A discoloration of the ice attracted my attention , and as I looked it seemed to retreat into the solid mass .
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 41]: There was something not ice within it , which grew more and more distinct as I gazed , until at last I plainly distinguished the form of my grandmother lying as then when my aunt made me touch her face .
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 20]: A few yards further on lay the body of my uncle , as I saw him in his coffin .
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 26]: His face was dead white in the midst of the cold clear ice , his eyes closed , and his arms straight by his side .
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 10]: He lay like an alabaster king upon his tomb .
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 27]: It _ was _ he , I thought , but he would never speak to me more -- never look at me -- never more awake .
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 25]: There lay all that was left of him -- the cold frozen memory of what he had been , and would never be again .
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 5]: I did not weep .
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 49]: I only knew somehow in my dream that life was all a wandering in a frozen cave , where the faces of the living were dark with the coming corruption , and the memories of the dead , cold and clear and hopeless evermore , alone were lovely .
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 23]: I walked further ; for the ice might possess yet more of the past -- all that was left me of life .
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 36]: And again I stood and gazed , for , deep within , I saw the form of Charley -- at rest now , his face bloodless , but not so death-like as my uncle 's .
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 42]: His hands were laid palm to palm over his bosom , and pointed upwards , as if praying for comfort where comfort was none : here at least were no flickerings of the rainbow fancies of faith and hope and charity !
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 36]: I gazed in comfortless content for a time on the repose of my weary friend , and then went on , inly moved to see what further the ice of the godless region might hold .
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 28]: Nor had I wandered far when I saw the form of Mary , lying like the rest , only that her hands were crossed on her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 11]: I stood , wondering to find myself so little moved .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 51]: But when the ice drew nigh me , and would have closed around me , my heart leaped for joy ; and when the heat of my lingering life repelled it , my heart sunk within me , and I said to myself : ` Death will not have me .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 25]: I may not join her even in the land of cold forgetfulness : I may not even be nothing _ with _ her . '
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 51]: The tears began to flow down my face , like the thin veil of water that kept ever flowing down the face of the ice ; and as I wept , the water before me flowed faster and faster , till it rippled in a sheet down the icy wall .
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 36]: Faster and yet faster it flowed , falling , with the sound as of many showers , into the runnel below , which rushed splashing and gurgling away from the foot of the vanishing wall .
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 25]: Faster and faster it flowed , until the solid mass fell in a foaming cataract , and swept in a torrent across the cave .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 13]: I followed the retreating wall through the seething water at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 19]: Thinner and thinner grew the dividing mass ; nearer and nearer came the form of my Mary . '
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 29]: I shall yet clasp her , ' I cried ; ` her dead form will kill me , and I too shall be inclosed in the friendly ice .
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 9]: I shall not be with her , alas !
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 18]: but neither shall I be without her , for I shall depart into the lovely nothingness . '
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 8]: Thinner and thinner grew the dividing wall .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 15]: The skirt of her shroud hung like a wet weed in the falling torrent .
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 48]: I kneeled in the river , and crept nearer with outstretched arms : when the vanishing ice set the dead form free , it should rest in those arms -- the last gift of the life-dream -- for then , surely , I _ must _ die .
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 13]: ` Let me pass in the agony of a lonely embrace ! '
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 6]: As I spoke she moved .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 17]: I started to my feet , stung into life by the agony of a new hope .
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 14]: Slowly the ice released her , and gently she rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 15]: The torrents of water ceased -- they had flowed but to set her free .
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 31]: Her eyes were still closed , but she made one blind step towards me , and laid her left hand on my head , her right hand on my heart .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 17]: Instantly , body and soul , I was cool as a Summer eve after a thunder-shower .
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 22]: For a moment , precious as an aeon , she held her hands upon me -- then slowly opened her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 11]: Out of them flashed the living soul of my Athanasia .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 37]: She closed the lids again slowly over the lovely splendour ; the water in which we stood rose around us ; and on its last billow she floated away through the winding passage of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 10]: I sought to follow her , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 6]: I cried aloud and awoke .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 45]: But the burning heat had left me ; I felt that I had passed a crisis , and had begun to recover -- a conviction which would have been altogether unwelcome , but for the poor shadow of a reviving hope which accompanied it .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 17]: Such a dream , come whence it might , could not but bring comfort with it .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 10]: The hope grew , and was my sole medicine .
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 38]: Before the evening I felt better , and , though still very feeble , managed to write to Marston , letting him know I was safe , and requesting him to forward any letters that might arrive .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 13]: The next day , I rose , but was unable to work .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 8]: The very thought of writing sickened me .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 11]: Neither could I bear the thought of returning to London .
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 24]: I tried to read , but threw aside book after book , without being able to tell what one of them was about .
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 39]: If for a moment I seemed to enter into the subject , before I reached the bottom of the page , I found I had not an idea as to what the words meant or whither they tended .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 26]: After many failures , unwilling to give myself up to idle brooding , I fortunately tried some of the mystical poetry of the seventeenth century .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 37]: The difficulties of that I found rather stimulate than repel me ; while , much as there was in the form to displease the taste , there was more in the matter to rouse the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 20]: I found also some relief in resuming my mathematical studies : the abstraction of them acted as an anodyne .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 6]: But the days dragged wearily .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 21]: As soon as I was able to get on horseback , the tone of mind and body began to return .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 33]: I felt as if into me some sort of animal healing passed from Lilith ; and who can tell in how many ways the lower animals may not minister to the higher ?
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 8]: One night I had a strange experience .
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 29]: I give it without argument , perfectly aware that the fact may be set down to the disordered state of my physical nature , and that without injustice .
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 26]: I had not for a long time thought about one of the questions which had so much occupied Charley and myself -- that of immortality .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 41]: As to any communication between the parted , I had never , during his life , pondered the possibility of it , although I had always had an inclination to believe that such intercourse had in rare instances taken place .
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 36]: Former periods of the world 's history , when that blinding self-consciousness which is the bane of ours was yet undeveloped , must , I thought , have been far more favourable to its occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 14]: Anyhow I was convinced that it was not to be gained by effort .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 89]: I confess that , in the unthinking agony of grief after Charley 's death , many a time when I woke in the middle of the night and could sleep no more , I sat up in bed and prayed him , if he heard me , to come to me , and let me tell him the truth -- for my sake to let me know , at least , that he lived , for then I should be sure that one day all would be well .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 12]: But if there was any hearing , there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 29]: Charley did not come ; the prayer seemed to vanish in the darkness ; and my more self-possessed meditations never justified the hope of any such being heard .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 29]: One night I was sitting in my grannie 's room , which , except my uncle 's , was now the only one I could bear to enter .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 44]: I had been reading for some time very quietly , but had leaned back in my chair , and let my thoughts go wandering whither they would , when all at once I was possessed by the conviction that Charley was near me .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 48]: I saw nothing , heard nothing ; of the recognized senses of humanity not one gave me a hint of a presence ; and yet my whole body was aware -- so , at least , it seemed -- of the proximity of another _ I _ .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 29]: It was as if some nervous region commensurate with my frame , were now for the first time revealed by contact with an object suitable for its apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 31]: Like Eliphaz , I felt the hair of my head stand up -- not from terror , but simply , as it seemed , from the presence and its strangeness .
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 24]: Like others also of whom I have read , who believed themselves in the presence of the disembodied , I could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 39]: I tried , but as if the medium for sound had been withdrawn , and an empty gulf lay around me , no word followed , although my very soul was full of the cry -- _ Charley !
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 2]: Charley !
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 4]: _ And alas !
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 35]: in a few moments , like the faint vanishing of an unrealized thought , leaving only the assurance that something half-born from out the unknown had been there , the influence faded and died .
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 35]: It passed from me like the shadow of a cloud , and once more I knew but my poor lonely self , returning to its candles , its open book , its burning fire .
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVIII .
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 4]: THE DARKEST HOUR .
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 19]: Suffering is perhaps the only preparation for suffering : still I was but poorly prepared for what followed .
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 27]: Having gathered strength , and a certain quietness which I could not mistake for peace , I returned to London towards the close of the Spring .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 10]: I had in the interval heard nothing of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 15]: The few letters Marston had sent on had been almost exclusively from my publishers .
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 28]: But the very hour I reached my lodging , came a note , which I opened trembling , for it was in the handwriting of Miss Pease .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 29]: DEAR SIR , -- I can not , I think , be wrong in giving you a piece of information which will be in the newspapers to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 36]: Your old acquaintance , and my young relative , Mr Brotherton , was married this morning , at St George 's , Hanover Square , to your late friend 's sister , Miss Mary Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 12]: They have just left for Dover on their way to Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 9]: Your sincere well-wisher , ` JANE PEASE . '
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 54]: Even at this distance of time , I should have to exhort myself to write with calmness , were it not that the utter despair of conveying my feelings , if indeed my soul had not for the time passed beyond feeling into some abyss unknown to human consciousness , renders it unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 53]: This despair of communication has two sources -- the one simply the conviction of the impossibility of expressing _ any _ feeling , much more such feeling as mine then was -- and is ; the other the conviction that only to the heart of love can the sufferings of love speak .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 33]: The attempt of a lover to move , by the presentation of his own suffering , the heart of her who loves him not , is as unavailing as it is unmanly .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 62]: The poet who sings most wailfully of the torments of the lover 's hell , is but a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal in the ears of her who has at best only a general compassion to meet the song withal -- possibly only an individual vanity which crowns her with his woes as with the trophies of a conquest .
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 99]: True , he is understood and worshipped by all the other wailful souls in the first infernal circle , as one of the great men of their order -- able to put into words full of sweet torment the dire hopelessness of their misery ; but for such the singer , singing only for ears eternally deaf to his song , cares nothing ; or if for a moment he receives consolation from their sympathy , it is but a passing weakness which the breath of an indignant self-condemnation -- even contempt , the next moment sweeps away .
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 26]: In God alone there must be sympathy and cure ; but I had not then -- have I indeed yet found what that cure is ?
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 12]: I am at all events now able to write with calmness .
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 27]: If suffering destroyed itself , as some say , mine ought to have disappeared long ago ; but to that I can neither pretend nor confess .
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 18]: For the first time , after all I had encountered , I knew what suffering could be .
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 42]: It is still at moments an agony as of hell to recall this and the other thought that then stung me like a white-hot arrow : the shafts have long been drawn out , but the barbed heads are still there .
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 6]: I neither stormed nor maddened .
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 66]: I only felt a freezing hand lay hold of my heart , and gripe it closer and closer till I should have sickened , but that the pain ever stung me into fresh life ; and ever since I have gone about the world with that hard lump somewhere in my bosom into which the griping hand and the griped heart have grown and stiffened .
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 29]: I fled at once back to my solitary house , looking for no relief in its solitude , only the negative comfort of escaping the eyes of men .
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 10]: I could not bear the sight of my fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 46]: To say that the world had grown black to me , is as nothing : I ceased -- I will not say _ to believe _ in God , for I never dared say that mighty thing -- but I ceased to hope in God .
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 19]: The universe had grown a negation which yet forced its presence upon me -- death that bred worms .
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 19]: If there were a God anywhere , this universe could be nothing more than his forsaken moth-eaten garment .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 9]: He was a God who did not care .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 23]: Order was all an invention of phosphorescent human brains ; light itself the mocking smile of a Jupiter over his writhing sacrifices .
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 31]: At times I laughed at the tortures of my own heart , saying to it , ` Writhe on , worm ; thou deservest thy writhing in that thou writhest .
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 11]: Godless creature , why dost thou not laugh with me ?
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 21]: Am I not merry over thee and the world -- in that ye are both rottenness to the core ? '
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 24]: The next moment my heart and I would come together with a shock , and I knew it was myself that scorned myself .
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 32]: Such being my mood , it will cause no surprise if I say that I too was tempted to suicide ; the wonder would have been if it had been otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 38]: The soft keen curves of that fatal dagger , which had not only slain Charley but all my hopes -- for had he lived this horror could not have been -- grew almost lovely in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 23]: Until now it had looked cruel , fiendish , hateful ; but now I would lay it before me and contemplate it .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 62]: In some griefs there is a wonderful power of self-contemplation , which indeed forms their only solace ; the moment it can set the sorrow away from itself sufficiently to regard it , the tortured heart begins to repose ; but suddenly , like a waking tiger , the sorrow leaps again into its lair , and the agony commences anew .
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 32]: The dagger was the type of my grief and its torture : might it not , like the brazen serpent , be the cure for the sting of its living counterpart ?
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 5]: where was the certainty ?
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 6]: Could I slay _ myself ?
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 18]: _ This outer breathing form I could dismiss -- but the pain was not _ there _ .
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 20]: I was not mad , and I knew that a deeper death than that could give , at least .
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 14]: than I had any assurance that could give , alone could bring repose .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 26]: For , impossible as I had always found it actually to believe in immortality , I now found it equally impossible to believe in annihilation .
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 36]: And even if annihilation should be the final result , who could tell but it might require ages of a horrible slow-decaying dream-consciousness to kill the living thing which felt itself other than its body ?
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 42]: Until now , I had always accepted what seemed the natural and universal repugnance to absolute dissolution as the strongest argument on the side of immortality ; -- for why should a man shrink from that which belonged to his nature ?
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 24]: But now annihilation seemed the one lovely thing , the one sole only lonely thought in which lay no blackness of burning darkness .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 8]: Oh , for one eternal unconscious sleep !
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 38]: -- the nearest likeness we can cherish of that inconceivable nothingness -- ever denied by the very thinking of it -- by the vain attempt to realize that whose very existence is the knowing nothing of itself !
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 72]: Could that dagger have insured me such repose , or had there been any draught of Lethe , utter Lethe , whose blessed poison would have assuredly dissipated like a fume this conscious self-tormenting _ me _ , I should not now be writhing anew , as in the clutches of an old grief , clasping me like a corpse , stung to simulated life by the galvanic battery of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 22]: Vivid as it seems -- all I suffer as I write is but a faint phantasm of what I then endured .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 34]: I learned , therefore , that to some minds the argument for immortality drawn from the apparently universal shrinking from annihilation must be ineffectual , seeing they themselves do not shrink from it .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 47]: Convince a man that there is no God -- or , for I doubt if that be altogether possible -- make it , I will say , impossible for him to hope in God -- and it can not be that annihilation should seem an evil .
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 30]: If there is no God , annihilation is the one thing to be longed for , with all that might of longing which is the mainspring of human action .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 50]: In a word , it is not immortality the human heart cries out after , but that immortal eternal thought whose life is its life , whose wisdom is its wisdom , whose ways and whose thoughts shall -- must one day -- become its ways and its thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 38]: Dissociate immortality from the living Immortality , and it is not a thing to be desired -- not a thing that can on those terms , or even on the fancy of those terms , be desired .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 11]: But such thoughts as these were far from me then .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 8]: I lived because I despaired of death .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 14]: I ate by a sort of blind animal instinct , and so lived .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 44]: The time had been when I would despise myself for being able to eat in the midst of emotion ; but now I cared so little for the emotion even , that eating or not eating had nothing to do with the matter .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 17]: I ate because meat was set before me ; I slept because sleep came upon me .
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 6]: It was a horrible time .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 21]: My life seemed only a vermiculate one , a crawling about of half-thoughts-half-feelings through the corpse of a decaying existence .
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 35]: The heart of being was withdrawn from me , and my life was but the vacant pericardium in which it had once throbbed out and sucked in the red fountains of life and gladness .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 21]: I would not be thought to have fallen to this all but bottomless depth only because I had lost Mary .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 35]: Still less was it because of the fact that in her , around whom had gathered all the devotion with which the man in me could regard woman , I had lost all womankind .
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 30]: It was _ the loss _ of Mary , as I then judged it , not , I repeat , the fact that _ I _ had lost her .
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 8]: It was that she had lost herself .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 15]: Thence it was , I say , that I lost my hope in God .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 21]: For , if there were a God , how could he let purity be clasped in the arms of defilement ?
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 17]: how could he marry my Athanasia -- not to a corpse , but to a Plague ?
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 27]: Here was the man who had done more to ruin her brother than any but her father , and God had given her to _ him !
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 29]: _ I had had -- with the commonest of men -- some notion of womanly purity -- how was it that hers had not instinctively shuddered and shrunk ?
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 32]: how was it that the life of it had not taken refuge with death to shun bare contact with the coarse impurity of such a nature as that of Geoffrey Brotherton ?
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 7]: My dreams had been dreams indeed !
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 11]: Was my Athanasia dead , or had she never been ?
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 29]: In my thought , she had ` said to Corruption , Thou art my father ; to the worm , Thou art my mother and my sister . '
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 12]: Who should henceforth say of any woman that she was impure ?
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 23]: She _ might _ love him -- true ; but what was she then who was able to love such a man ?
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 21]: It was this that stormed the citadel of my hope , and drove me from even thinking of a God .
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 21]: Gladly would I now have welcomed any bodily suffering that could hide me from myself ; but no illness came .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 10]: I was a living pain , a conscious ill-being .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 16]: In a thousand forms those questions would ever recur , but without hope of answer .
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 30]: When I fell asleep from exhaustion , hideous visions of her with Geoffrey would start me up with a great cry , sometimes with a curse on my lips .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 19]: Nor were they the most horrible of those dreams in which she would help him to mock me .
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 28]: Once , and only once , I found myself dreaming the dream of _ that _ night , and I knew that I had dreamed it before .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 66]: Through palace and chapel and charnel-house , I followed her , ever with a dim sense of awful result ; and when at the last she lifted the shining veil , instead of the face of Athanasia , the bare teeth of a skull grinned at me from under a spotted shroud , through which the sunlight shone from behind , revealing all its horrors .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 19]: I was not mad -- my reason had not given way : _ how _ remains a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIX .
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 3]: THE DAWN .
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 22]: All places were alike to me now -- for the universe was but one dreary chasm whence I could not escape .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 23]: One evening I sat by the open window of my chamber , which looked towards those trees and that fatal Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 29]: My suffering had now grown dull by its own excess , and I had moments of restless vacuity , the nearest approach to peace I had yet experienced .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 22]: It was a fair evening of early summer -- but I was utterly careless of nature as of all beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 14]: The sky was nothing to me -- and the earth was all unlovely .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 20]: There I sat , heavy , but free from torture ; a kind of quiet had stolen over me .
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 64]: I was roused by the tiniest breath of wind on my cheek , as if the passing wing of some butterfly had fanned me ; and on that faintest motion came a scent as from long-forgotten fields , a scent like as of sweet-peas or wild roses , but of neither : flowers were none nearer me than the gardens of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 6]: I started with a cry .
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 20]: It was the scent of the garments of my Athanasia , as I had dreamed it in my dream !
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 11]: Whence that wind had borne it , who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 27]: but in the husk that had overgrown my being it had found a cranny , and through that cranny , with the scent , Nature entered .
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 21]: I looked up to the blue sky , wept , and for the first time fell on my knees . '
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 4]: O God ! '
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 8]: I cried , and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 17]: But what are the prayers of the whole universe more than expansions of that one cry ?
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 15]: It is not what God can give us , but God that we want .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 55]: Call the whole thing fancy if you will ; it was at least no fancy that the next feeling of which I was conscious was compassion : from that moment I began to search heaven and earth and the soul of man and woman for excuses wherewith to clothe the idea of Mary Osborne .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 178]: For weeks and weeks I pondered , and by degrees the following conclusions wrought themselves out in my brain : -- That she had never seen life as a whole ; that her religious theories had ever been eating away and absorbing her life , so preventing her religion from interpenetrating and glorifying it ; that in regard to certain facts and consequences she had been left to an ignorance which her innocence rendered profound ; that , attracted by the worldly splendour of the offer , her father and mother had urged her compliance , and broken in spirit by the fate of Charley , and having always been taught that self-denial was in itself a virtue , she had taken the worldly desires of her parents for the will of God , and blindly yielded ; that Brotherton was capable , for his ends , of representing himself as possessed of religion enough to satisfy the scruples of her parents , and , such being satisfied , she had resisted her own as evil things .
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 22]: Whether his hatred of me had had any share in his desire to possess her , I hardly thought of inquiring .
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 34]: Of course I did not for a single moment believe that Mary had had the slightest notion of the bitterness , the torture , the temptation of Satan it would be to me .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 21]: Doubtless the feeling of her father concerning the death of Charley had seemed to hollow an impassable gulf between us .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 25]: Worn and weak , and not knowing what she did , my dearest friend had yielded herself to the embrace of my deadliest foe .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 42]: If he was such as I had too good reason for believing him , she was far more to be pitied than I. Lonely she must be -- lonely as I -- for who was there to understand and love her ?
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 46]: Bitterly too by this time she must have suffered , for the dove can never be at peace in the bosom of the vulture , or cease to hate the carrion of which he must ever carry about with him at least the disgusting memorials .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 26]: I too had been her enemy , and had cried out against her ; but now I would love her more and better than ever !
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 26]: if I knew but something I could do for her , some service which on the bended knees of my spirit I might offer her !
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 15]: I clomb the heights of my grief , and looked around , but alas !
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 7]: I was such a poor creature !
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 42]: A dabbler in the ways of the world , a writer of tales which even those who cared to read them counted fantastic and Utopian , who was I to weave a single silken thread into the web of her life ?
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 9]: How could I bear her one poorest service ?
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 21]: Never in this world could I approach her near enough to touch yet once again the hem of her garment .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 9]: All I could do was to love her .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 10]: No -- I could and did suffer for her .
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 15]: that suffering was only for myself , and could do nothing , for her !
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 29]: It was indeed some consolation to me that my misery came from her hand ; but if she knew it , it would but add to her pain .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 30]: In my heart I could only pray her pardon for my wicked and selfish thoughts concerning her , and vow again and ever to regard her as my Athanasia .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 4]: -- But yes !
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 41]: there was one thing I _ could _ do for her : I would be a true man for her sake ; she should have some satisfaction in me ; I would once more arise and go to my Father .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 22]: The instant the thought arose in my mind , I fell down before the possible God in an agony of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 21]: All complaint of my own doom had vanished , now that I began to do her the justice of love .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 21]: Why should _ I _ be blessed -- here and now at least -- according to my notions of blessedness ?
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 14]: Let the great heart of the universe do with me as it pleased !
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 19]: Let the Supreme take his own time to justify himself to the heart that sought to love him !
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 60]: I gave up myself , was willing to suffer , to be a living pain , so long as he pleased ; and the moment I yielded half the pain was gone ; I gave my Athanasia yet again to God , and all _ might _ yet , in some nigh , far-off , better-world-way , be well .
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 6]: I could wait and endure .
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 25]: If only God was , and was God , then it was , or would be , well with Mary -- well with me !
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 73]: But , as I still sat , a flow of sweet sad repentant thought passing gently through my bosom , all at once the self to which , unable to confide it to the care of its own very life , the God conscious of himself and in himself conscious of it , I had been for months offering the sacrifices of despair and indignation , arose in spectral hideousness before me .
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 30]: I saw that I , a child of the infinite , had been worshipping the finite -- and therein dragging down the infinite towards the fate of the finite .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 15]: I do not mean that in Mary Osborne I had been worshipping the finite .
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 39]: It was the eternal , the lovely , the true that in her I had been worshipping : in myself I had been worshipping the mean , the selfish , the finite , the god of spiritual greed .
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 31]: Only in himself _ can _ a man find the finite to worship ; only in turning back upon himself does he create the finite for and by his worship .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 19]: All the works of God are everlasting ; the only perishable are some of the works of man .
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 45]: All love is a worship of the infinite : what is called a man 's love for himself , is not love ; it is but a phantastic resemblance of love ; it is a creating of the finite , a creation of death .
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 9]: A man _ can not _ love himself .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 35]: If all love be not creation -- as I think it is -- it is at least the only thing in harmony with creation , and the love of oneself is its absolute opposite .
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 18]: I sickened at the sight of myself : how should I ever get rid of the demon ?
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 27]: The same instant I saw the one escape : I must offer it back to its source -- commit it to him who had made it .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 33]: I must live no more from it , but from the source of it ; seek to know nothing more of it than he gave me to know by his presence therein .
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 29]: Thus might I become one with the Eternal in such an absorption as Buddha had never dreamed ; thus might I draw life ever fresh from its fountain .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 11]: And in that fountain alone would I contemplate its reflex .
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 29]: What flashes of self-consciousness might cross me , should be God 's gift , not of my seeking , and offered again to him in ever new self-sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 24]: this I saw then , and this I yet see ; but oh , how far am I still from that divine annihilation !
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 21]: The only comfort is , God is , and I am his , else I should not be at all .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 14]: I saw too that thus God also lives -- in his higher way .
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 33]: I saw , shadowed out in the absolute devotion of Jesus to men , that the very life of God by which we live is an everlasting eternal giving of himself away .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 17]: He asserts himself , only , solely , altogether , in an infinite sacrifice of devotion .
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 27]: So must we live ; the child must be as the father ; live he can not on any other plan , struggle as he may .
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 25]: The father requires of him nothing that he is not or does not himself , who is the one prime unconditioned sacrificer and sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 29]: I threw myself on the ground , and offered back my poor wretched self to its owner , to be taken and kept , purified and made divine .
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 13]: The same moment a sense of reviving health began to possess me .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 27]: With many fluctuations , it has possessed me , has grown , and is now , if not a persistent cheerfulness , yet an unyielding hope .
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 7]: The world bloomed again around me .
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 27]: The sunrise again grew gloriously dear ; and the sadness of the moon was lighted from a higher sun than that which returns with the morning .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 59]: My relation to Mary resolved and re-formed itself in my mind into something I can explain only by the following -- call it dream : it was not a dream ; call it vision : it was not a vision ; and yet I will tell it as if it were either , being far truer than either .
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 12]: I lay like a child on one of God 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 19]: I could not see his face , and the arm that held me was a great cloudy arm .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 10]: I knew that on his other arm lay Mary .
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 64]: But between us were forests and plains , mountains and great seas ; and , unspeakably worse than all , a gulf with which words had nothing to do , a gulf of pure separation , of impassable nothingness , across which no device , I say not of human skill , but of human imagination , could cast a single connecting cord .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 18]: There lay Mary , and here lay I -- both in God 's arms -- utterly parted .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 26]: As in a swoon I lay , through which suddenly came the words : ` What God hath joined , man can not sunder . '
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 8]: I lay thinking what they could mean .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 8]: All at once I thought I knew .
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 41]: Straightway I rose on the cloudy arm , looked down on a measureless darkness beneath me , and up on a great , dreary , world-filled eternity above me , and crept along the arm towards the bosom of God .
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 36]: In telling my -- neither vision nor dream nor ecstasy , I can not help it that the forms grow so much plainer and more definite in the words than they were in the revelation .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 58]: Words always give either too much or too little shape : when you want to be definite , you find your words clumsy and blunt ; when you want them for a vague shadowy image , you straightway find them give a sharp and impertinent outline , refusing to lend themselves to your undefined though vivid thought .
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 13]: Forms themselves are hard enough to manage , but words are unmanageable .
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 11]: I must therefore trust to the heart of my reader .
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 30]: I crept into the bosom of God , and along a great cloudy peace , which I could not understand , for it did not yet enter into me .
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 17]: At length I came to the heart of God , and through that my journey lay .
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 21]: The moment I entered it , the great peace appeared to enter mine , and I began to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 25]: Something melted in my heart , and for a moment I thought I was dying , but I found I was being born again .
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 31]: My heart was empty of its old selfishness , and I loved Mary tenfold -- no longer in the least for my own sake , but all for her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 29]: The same moment I knew that the heart of God was a bridge , along which I was crossing the unspeakable eternal gulf that divided Mary and me .
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 23]: At length , somehow , I know not how , somewhere , I know not where , I was where she was .
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 44]: She knew nothing of my presence , turned neither face nor eye to meet me , stretched out no hand to give me the welcome of even a friend , and yet I not only knew , but felt that she was mine .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 41]: I wanted nothing from her ; desired the presence of her loveliness only that I might know it ; hung about her life as a butterfly over the flower he loves ; was satisfied that she could _ be _ .
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 27]: I had left my self behind in the heart of God , and now I was a pure essence , fit to rejoice in the essential .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 11]: my whole being was not yet subject to its best .
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 23]: I began to long to be able to do something for her besides -- I foolishly said _ beyond _ loving her .
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 23]: Back rushed my old self in the selfish thought : Some day -- will she not know -- and at least -- ?
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 6]: That moment the vision vanished .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 6]: I was tossed -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 20]: let me hope , only to the other arm of God -- but I lay in torture yet again .
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 83]: For a man may see visions manifold , and believe them all ; and yet his faith shall not save him ; something more is needed -- he must have that presence of God in his soul , of which the Son of Man spoke , saying : ` If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him . '
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 29]: God in him , he will be able to love for very love 's sake ; God not in him , his best love will die into selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 3]: CHAPTER LX .
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 3]: MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER .
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 15]: The morning then which had thus dawned upon me , was often over-clouded heavily .
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 33]: Yet it was the morning and not the night ; and one of the strongest proofs that it was the morning lay in this , that again I could think in verse .
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 16]: One day , after an hour or two of bitterness , I wrote the following .
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 35]: A man 's trouble must have receded from him a little for the moment , if he descries any shape in it , so as to be able to give it form in words .
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 14]: I set it down with no hope of better than the vaguest sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 8]: There came no music with this one .
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 59]: If it be that a man and a woman Are made for no mutual grief ; That each gives the pain to some other , And neither can give the relief ; If thus the chain of the world Is tied round the holy feet , I scorn to shrink from facing What my brothers and sisters meet .
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 34]: But I cry when the wolf is tearing At the core of my heart as now : When I was the man to be tortured , Why should the woman be _ thou ?
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 17]: _ I am not so ready to sink from the lofty in to the abject now .
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 54]: If at times I yet feel that the whole creation is groaning and travailing , I know what it is for -- its redemption from the dominion of its own death into that sole liberty which comes only of being filled and eternally possessed by God himself , its source and its life .
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 26]: And now I found also that my heart began to be moved with a compassion towards my fellows such as I had never before experienced .
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 19]: I shall best convey what I mean by transcribing another little poem I wrote about the same time .
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 66]: Once I sat on a crimson throne , And I held the world in fee ; Below me I heard my brothers moan , And I bent me down to see ; -- Lovingly bent and looked on them , But _ I _ had no inward pain ; I sat in the heart of my ruby gem , Like a rainbow without the rain .
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 29]: My throne is vanished ; helpless I lie At the foot of its broken stair ; And the sorrows of all humanity Through my heart make a thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 31]: Let such things rest for a while : I have now to relate another incident -- strange enough , but by no means solitary in the records of human experience .
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 36]: My reader will probably think that of dreams and visions there has already been more than enough : but perhaps she will kindly remember that at this time I had no outer life at all .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 12]: Whatever bore to me the look of existence was within me .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 49]: All my days the tendency had been to an undue predominance of thought over action , and now that the springs of action were for a time dried up , what wonder was it if thought , lording it alone , should assume a reality beyond its right ?
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 69]: Hence the life of the day was prolonged into the night ; nor was there other than a small difference in their conditions , beyond the fact that the contrast of outer things was removed in sleep ; whence the shapes which the waking thought had assumed had space and opportunity , as it were , to thicken before the mental eye until they became dreams and visions .
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 14]: But concerning what I am about to relate I shall offer no theory .
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 36]: Such mere operation of my own thoughts may be sufficient to account for it : I would only ask -- does any one know what the _ mere _ operation of his own thoughts signifies ?
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 45]: I can not isolate myself , especially in those moments when the individual will is less awake , from the ocean of life and thought which not only surrounds me , but on which I am in a sense one of the floating bubbles .
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 29]: I was asleep , but I thought I lay awake in bed -- in the room where I still slept -- that which had been my grannie 's .
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 19]: -- It was dark midnight , and the wind was howling about the gable and in the chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 9]: The door opened , and some one entered .
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 28]: By the lamp she carried I knew my great-grandmother , -- just as she looked in life , only that now she walked upright and with ease .
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 18]: That I was dreaming is plain from the fact that I felt no surprise at seeing her .
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 15]: ` Wilfrid , come with me , ' she said , approaching the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 4]: ` Rise . '
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 6]: I obeyed like a child .
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 10]: ` Put your cloak on , ' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 22]: ` It is a stormy midnight , but we have not so far to go as you may think . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 11]: I think nothing , grannie , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 12]: I do not know where you want to take me . '
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 9]: ` Come and see then , my son .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 16]: You must at last learn what has been kept from you far too long . '
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 22]: As she spoke she led the way down the stair , through the kitchen , and out into the dark night .
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 29]: I remember the wind blowing my cloak about , but I remember nothing more until I found myself in the winding hazel-walled lane , leading to Umberden Church .
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 29]: My grannie was leading me by one withered hand ; in the other she held the lamp , over the flame of which the wind had no power .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 41]: She led me into the churchyard , took the key from under the tombstone , unlocked the door of the church , put the lamp into my hand , pushed me gently in , and shut the door behind me .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 37]: I walked to the vestry , and set the lamp on the desk , with a vague feeling that I had been there before , and that I had now to do something at this desk .
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 25]: Above it I caught sight of the row of vellum-bound books , and remembered that one of them contained something of importance to me .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 5]: I took it down .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 21]: The moment I opened it I remembered with distinctness the fatal discrepancy in the entry of my grannie 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 26]: I found the place : to my astonishment the date of the year was now the same as that on the preceding page -- 1747 .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 12]: That instant I awoke in the first gush of the sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 30]: I could not help feeling even a little excited by my dream , and the impression of it grew upon me : I wanted to see the book again .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 5]: I could not rest .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 12]: Something seemed constantly urging me to go and look at it .
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 33]: Half to get the thing out of my head , I sent Styles to fetch Lilith , and for the first time since the final assurance of my loss , mounted her .
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 6]: I rode for Umberden Church .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 42]: It was long after noon before I had made up my mind , and when , having tied Lilith to the gate , I entered the church , one red ray from the setting sun was nestling in the very roof .
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 35]: Knowing what I should find , yet wishing to see it again , I walked across to the vestry , feeling rather uncomfortable at the thought of prying thus alone into the parish register .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 31]: I could almost have persuaded myself that I was dreaming still ; and in looking back , I can hardly in my mind separate the dreaming from the waking visit .
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 56]: Of course I found just what I had expected -- 1748 , not 1747 -- at the top of the page , and was about to replace the register , when the thought occurred to me that , if the dream had been potent enough to bring me hither , it might yet mean something .
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 6]: I lifted the cover again .
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 7]: There the entry stood undeniably plain .
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 14]: This time , however , I noted two other little facts concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 41]: I will just remind my reader that the entry was crushed in between the date of the year and the next entry -- plainly enough to the eye ; and that there was no attestation to the entries of 1747 .
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 40]: The first additional fact -- and clearly an important one -- was that , in the summing up of 1748 , before the signature , which stood near the bottom of the cover , a figure had been altered .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 27]: Originally it stood : ` In all six couple , ' but the six had been altered to a seven -- corresponding with the actual number .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 16]: This appeared proof positive that the first entry on the cover was a forged insertion .
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 8]: And how clumsily it had been managed !
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 9]: ` What could my grannie be about ? '
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 5]: I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 20]: It never occurred to me then that it might have been intended to _ look like _ a forgery .
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 20]: Still I kept staring at it , as if by very force of staring I could find out something .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 17]: There was not the slightest sign of erasure or alteration beyond the instance I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 53]: Yet -- and here was my second note -- when I compared the whole of the writing on the cover with the writing on the preceding page , though it seemed the same hand , it seemed to have got stiffer and shakier , as if the writer had grown old between .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 47]: Finding nothing very suggestive in this , however , I fell into a dreamy mood , watching the red light , as it faded , up in the old , dark , distorted roof of the desolate church -- with my hand lying on the book .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 54]: I have always had a bad habit of pulling and scratching at any knot or roughness in the paper of the book I happen to be reading ; and now , almost unconsciously , with my forefinger I was pulling at an edge of parchment which projected from the joint of the cover .
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 29]: When I came to myself and proceeded to close the book , I found it would not shut properly because of a piece which I had curled up .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 82]: Seeking to restore it to its former position , I fancied I saw a line or edge running all down the joint , and looking closer , saw that these last entries , in place of being upon a leaf of the book pasted to the cover in order to strengthen the binding , as I had supposed , were indeed upon a leaf which was pasted to the cover , but one which was not otherwise connected with the volume .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 16]: I now began to feel a more lively interest in the behaviour of my dream-grannie .
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 10]: Here might lie something to explain the hitherto inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 9]: I proceeded to pull the leaf gently away .
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 16]: It was of parchment , much thinner than the others , which were of vellum .
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 16]: I had withdrawn only a small portion when I saw there was writing under it .
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 7]: My heart began to beat faster .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 7]: But I would not be rash .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 18]: My old experience with parchment in the mending of my uncle 's books came to my aid .
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 27]: If I pulled at the dry skin as I had been doing , I might not only damage it , but destroy the writing under it .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 17]: I could do nothing without water , and I did not know where to find any .
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 28]: It would be better to ride to the village of Gastford , somewhere about two miles off , put up there , and arrange for future proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 19]: I did not know the way , and for a long time could see no one to ask .
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 21]: The consequence was that I made a wide round , and it was nearly dark before I reached the village .
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 21]: I thought it better for the present to feed Lilith , and then make the best of my way home .
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 40]: The next evening -- I felt so like a thief that I sought the thievish security of the night -- having provided myself with what was necessary , and borrowed a horse for Styles , I set out again .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXI .
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 4]: THE PARISH REGISTER .
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 19]: The sky clouded as we went ; it grew very dark , and the wind began to blow .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 5]: It threatened a storm .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 22]: I told Styles a little of what I was about -- just enough to impress on him the necessity for prudence .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 28]: The wind increased , and by the time we gained the copse , it was roaring , and the slender hazels bending like a field of corn .
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 16]: ` You will have enough to do with two horses , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 13]: I do n't mind it , sir , ' Styles answered . '
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 26]: A word from me will quiet Miss Lilith ; and for the other , I 've known him pretty well for two years past . '
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 18]: I left them tolerably sheltered in the winding lane , and betook myself alone to the church .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 21]: Cautiously I opened the door , and felt my way from pew to pew , for it was quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 14]: I could just distinguish the windows from the walls , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 29]: As soon as I reached the vestry , I struck a light , got down the volume , and proceeded to moisten the parchment with a wet sponge .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 44]: For some time the water made little impression on the old parchment , of which but one side could be exposed to its influence , and I began to fear I should be much longer in gaining my end than I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 75]: The wind roared and howled about the trembling church , which seemed too weak with age to resist such an onslaught ; but when at length the skin began to grow soft and yield to my gentle efforts at removal , I became far too much absorbed in the simple operation , which had to be performed with all the gentleness and nicety of a surgical one , to heed the uproar about me .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 14]: Slowly the glutinous adhesion gave way , and slowly the writing revealed itself .
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 58]: In mingled hope and doubt I restrained my curiosity ; and as one teases oneself sometimes by dallying with a letter of the greatest interest , not until I had folded down the parchment clear of what was manifestly an entry , did I bring my candle close to it , and set myself to read it .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 21]: Then , indeed , I found I had reason to regard with respect the dream which had brought me thither .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 15]: Right under the 1748 of the parchment , stood on the vellum cover 1747 .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 27]: Then followed the usual blank , and then came an entry corresponding word for word with the other entry of my great-grandfather and mother 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 8]: In all probability Moldwarp Hall was mine !
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 21]: Little as it could do for me now , I confess to a keen pang of pleasure at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 29]: Meantime , I followed out my investigation , and gradually stripped the parchment off the vellum to within a couple of inches of the bottom of the cover .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 40]: The result of knowledge was as follows : -- Next to the entry of the now hardly hypothetical marriage of my ancestors , stood the summing up of the marriages of 1747 , with the signature of the rector .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 11]: I paused , and , turning back , counted them .
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 16]: Including that in which alone I was interested , I found the number given correct .
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 27]: Next came by itself the figures 1748 , and then a few more entries , followed by the usual summing up and signature of the rector .
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 34]: From this I turned to the leaf of parchment ; there was a difference : upon the latter the sum was six , altered to seven ; on the former it was five .
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 16]: This of course suggested further search : I soon found where the difference indicated lay .
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 84]: As the entry of _ the _ marriage was , on the forged leaf , shifted up close to the forged 1748 , and as the summing and signature had to be omitted , because they belonged to the end of 1747 , a blank would have been left , and the writing below would have shone through and attracted attention , revealing the forgery of the whole , instead of that of the part only which was intended to look a forgery .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 18]: To prevent this , an altogether fictitious entry had been made -- over the summing and signature .
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 54]: This , with the genuine entries faithfully copied , made of the five , six , which the forger had written and then blotted into a seven , intending to expose the entry of my ancestors ' marriage as a forgery , while the rest of the year 's register should look genuine .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 35]: It took me some little trouble to clear it all up to my own mind , but by degrees everything settled into its place , assuming an intelligible shape in virtue of its position .
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 24]: With my many speculations as to why the mechanism of the forgery had assumed this shape , I need not trouble my reader .
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 20]: Suffice it to say that on more than one supposition , I can account for it satisfactorily to myself .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 20]: One other remark only will I make concerning it : I have no doubt it was an old forgery .
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 30]: One after another those immediately concerned in it had died , and there the falsehood lurked -- in latent power -- inoperative until my second visit to Umberden Church .
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 24]: But what differences might there not have been had it not started into activity for the brief space betwixt then and my sorrow ?
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 38]: I left the parchment still attached to the cover at the bottom , and , laying a sheet of paper between the formerly adhering surfaces , lest they should again adhere , closed and replaced the volume .
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 29]: Then , looking at my watch , I found that , instead of an hour as I had supposed , I had been in the church three hours .
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 14]: It was nearly eleven o'clock , too late for anything further that night .
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 15]: When I came out , the sky was clear and the stars were shining .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 6]: The storm had blown over .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 5]: Much rain had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 24]: But when the wind ceased or the rain began , I had no recollection ; the storm had vanished altogether from my consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 38]: I found Styles where I had left him , smoking his pipe and leaning against Lilith , who -- I can not call her _ which _ -- was feeding on the fine grass of the lane .
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 7]: The horse he had picketed near .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 6]: We mounted and rode home .
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 11]: The next thing was to see the rector of Umberden .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 19]: He lived in his other parish , and thither I rode the following day to call upon him .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 13]: I found him an old gentleman , of the squire-type of rector .
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 23]: As soon as he heard my name , he seemed to know who I was , and at once showed himself hospitable .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 21]: I told him that I came to him as I might , were I a Catholic , to a father-confessor .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 6]: This Startled him a little .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 28]: ` Do n't tell me anything I ought not to keep secret , ' he said ; and it gave me confidence in him at once . '
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 8]: I will not , ' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 8]: ` The secret is purely my own .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 27]: Whatever crime there is in it , was past punishment long before I was born ; and it was committed against , not by my family .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 18]: But it is rather a long story , and I hope I shall not be tedious . '
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 8]: He assured me of his perfect leisure .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 21]: I told him everything , from my earliest memory , which bore on the discovery I had at length made .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 31]: He soon showed signs of interest ; and when I had ended the tale with the facts of the preceding night , he silently rose and walked about the room .
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 21]: After a few moments , he said : ` And what do you mean to do , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 16]: ` Nothing , ' I answered , ` so long as Sir Giles is alive .
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 12]: He was kind to me when I was a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 29]: He came up behind me where I was seated , and laid his hand gently on my head ; then , without a word , resumed his walk .
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 11]: ` And if you survive him , what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 14]: ` Then I must be guided partly by circumstances , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 11]: ` And what do you want of me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 38]: I want you to go with me to the church , and see the book , that , in case of anything happening to it , you may be a witness concerning its previous contents . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 14]: I am too old to be the only witness , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 13]: ` You ought to have several of your own age . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 16]: I want as few to know the secret as may be , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 11]: ` You should have your lawyer one of them . '
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 25]: ` He would never leave me alone about it , ' I replied ; ` and positively I shall take no measures at present .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 15]: Some day I hope to punish him for deserting me as he did . '
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 11]: For I had told him how Mr Coningham had behaved .
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 7]: ` Revenge , Mr Cumbermede ? '
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 6]: ` Not a serious one .
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 31]: All the punishment I hope to give him is but to show him the fact of the case , and leave him to feel as he may about it . '
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 11]: ` There ca n't be much harm in that . '
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 20]: He reflected a few moments , and then said : ' I will tell you what will be best .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 9]: We shall go and see the book together .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 40]: I will make an extract of both entries , and give a description of the state of the volume , with an account of how the second entry -- or more properly the first -- came to be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 22]: This I shall sign in the presence of two witnesses , who need know nothing of the contents of the paper .
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 9]: Of that you shall yourself take charge . '
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 7]: We went together to the church .
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 23]: The old man , after making a good many objections , was at length satisfied , and made notes for his paper .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 21]: He started the question whether it would not be better to secure that volume at least under lock and key .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 28]: For this I thought there was no occasion -- that in fact it was safer where it was , and more certain of being forthcoming when wanted .
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 72]: I did suggest that the key of the church might be deposited in a place of safety ; but he answered that it had been kept there ever since he came to the living forty years ago , and for how long before that he could not tell ; and so a change would attract attention , and possibly make some talk in the parish , which had better be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 13]: Before the end of the week , he had his document ready .
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 25]: He signed it in my presence , and in that of two of his parishioners , who as witnesses appended their names and abodes .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 8]: I have it now in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 24]: I shall enclose it , with my great-grandfather and mother 's letters -- and something besides -- in the packet containing this history .
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 8]: That same week Sir Giles Brotherton died .
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXII .
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 4]: A FOOLISH TRIUMPH .
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 14]: I should have now laid claim to my property , but for Mary .
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 38]: To turn Sir Geoffrey with his mother and sister out of it , would have caused me little compunction , for they would still be rich enough ; I confess indeed it would have given me satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 49]: Nor could I say what real hurt of any kind it would occasion to Mary ; and if I were writing for the public , instead of my one reader , I know how foolishly incredible it must appear that for her sake I should forego such claims .
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 24]: She would , however , I trust , have been able to believe it without the proofs which I intend to give her .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 37]: The fact was simply this : I could not , even for my own sake , bear the thought of taking , in any manner or degree , a position if but apparently antagonistic to her .
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 29]: My enemy was her husband : he should reap the advantage of being her husband ; for her sake he should for the present retain what was mine .
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 59]: So long as there should be no reason to fear his adopting a different policy from his father 's in respect of his tenants , I felt myself at liberty to leave things as they were ; for Sir Giles had been a good landlord , and I knew the son was regarded with favour in the county .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 20]: Were he to turn out unjust or oppressive , however , then duty on my part would come in .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 78]: But I must also remind my reader that I had no love for affairs ; that I had an income perfectly sufficient for my wants ; that , both from my habits of thought and from my sufferings , my regard was upon life itself -- was indeed so far from being confined to this chrysalid beginning thereof , that I had lost all interest in this world save as the porch to the house of life .
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 63]: And , should I ever meet her again , in any possible future of being , how much rather would I not stand before her as one who had been even Quixotic for her sake -- as one who for a hair 's - breadth of her interest had felt the sacrifice of a fortune a merely natural movement of his life !
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 31]: She would then know not merely that I was true to her , but that I had been true in what I professed to believe when I sought her favour .
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 88]: And if it had been a pleasure to me -- call it a weakness , and I will not oppose the impeachment ; -- call it self-pity , and I will confess to that as having a share in it ; -- but , if it had been a shadowy pleasure to me to fancy I suffered for her sake , my present resolution , while it did not add the weight of a feather to my suffering , did yet give me a similar vague satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 72]: I must also confess to a certain satisfaction in feeling that I had power over my enemy -- power of making him feel my power -- power of vindicating my character against him as well , seeing one who could thus abstain from asserting his own rights could hardly have been one to invade the rights of another ; but the enjoyment of this consciousness appeared to depend on my silence .
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 28]: If I broke that , the strength would depart from me ; but while I held my peace , I held my foe in an invisible mesh .
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 95]: I half deluded myself into fancying that , while I kept my power over him unexercised , I retained a sort of pledge for his conduct to Mary , of which I was more than doubtful ; for a man with such antecedents as his , a man who had been capable of behaving as he had behaved to Charley , was less than likely to be true to his wife : he was less than likely to treat the sister as a lady , who to the brother had been a traitorous seducer .
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 22]: I have now to confess a fault as well as an imprudence -- punished , I believe , in the results .
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 13]: The behaviour of Mr. Coningham still rankled a little in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 75]: From Geoffrey I had never looked for anything but evil ; of Mr Coningham I had expected differently , and I began to meditate the revenge of holding him up to himself : I would punish him in a manner which , with his confidence in his business faculty , he must feel : I would simply show him how the precipitation of selfish disappointment had led him astray , and frustrated his designs .
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 31]: For if he had given even a decent attention to the matter , he would have found in the forgery itself hints sufficient to suggest the desirableness of further investigation .
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 39]: I had not , however , concluded upon anything , when one day I accidentally met him , and we had a little talk about business , for he continued to look after the rent of my field .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 72]: He informed me that Sir Geoffrey Brotherton had been doing all he could to get even temporary possession of the park , as we called it ; and , although I said nothing of it to Mr Coningham , my suspicion is that , had he succeeded , he would , at the risk of a law-suit , in which he would certainly have been cast , have ploughed it up .
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 30]: He told me , also , that Clara was in poor health ; she who had looked as if no blight could ever touch her had broken down utterly .
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 32]: The shadow of her sorrow was plain enough on the face of her father , and his confident manner had a little yielded , although he was the old man still .
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 10]: His father had died a little before Sir Giles .
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 10]: The new baronet had not offered him the succession .
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 46]: I asked him to go with me yet once more to Umberden Church -- for I wanted to show him something he had over-looked in the register -- not , I said , that it would be of the slightest furtherance to his former hopes .
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 22]: He agreed at once , already a little ashamed , perhaps , of the way in which he had abandoned me .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 13]: Before we parted we made an appointment to meet at the church .
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 8]: We went at once to the vestry .
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 12]: I took down the volume , and laid it before him .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 12]: He opened it , with a curious look at me first .
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 20]: But the moment he lifted the cover , its condition at once attracted and as instantly riveted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 45]: He gave me one glance more , in which questions and remarks and exclamations numberless lay in embryo ; then turning to the book , was presently absorbed , first in reading the genuine entry , next in comparing it with the forged one .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 7]: ` Right , after all ! '
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 5]: he exclaimed at length .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 5]: ` In what ? '
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 4]: I asked . '
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 15]: In dropping me without a word , as if I had been an impostor ?
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 21]: In forgetting that you yourself had raised in me the hopes whose discomfiture you took as a personal injury ? '
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 6]: ` My dear sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 13]: he stammered in an expostulatory tone , ` you must make allowance .
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 10]: It was a tremendous disappointment to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 27]: I can not say I felt it quite so much myself , but at least you owed me an apology for having misled me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 18]: I had _ not _ misled you , ' he retorted angrily , pointing to the register .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 5]: -- ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 13]: ` You left _ me _ to find that out , though .
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 12]: _ You _ took no further pains in the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 11]: ` How _ did _ you find it out ? '
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 14]: he asked , clutching at a change in the tone of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 17]: I said nothing of my dream , but I told him everything else concerning the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 17]: When I had finished -- ` It 's all plain sailing now , ' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 10]: ` There is not an obstacle in the way .
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 13]: I will set the thing in motion the instant I get home .
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 17]: -- It will be a victory worth achieving , ' he added , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 20]: ` Mr Coningham , I have not the slightest intention of moving in the matter , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 4]: His face fell .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 34]: ` You do not mean -- when you hold them in your very hands -- to throw away every advantage of birth and fortune , and be a nobody in the world ? '
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 32]: ` Infinite advantages of the kind you mean , Mr Coningham , could make me not one whit more than I am ; they _ might _ make me less . '
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 23]: ` Come , come , ' he expostulated ; ` you must not allow disappointment to upset your judgment of things . '
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 19]: ` My judgment of things lies deeper than any disappointment I have yet had , ' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 16]: ` My uncle 's teaching has at last begun to bear fruit in me . '
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 8]: ` Your uncle was a fool ! '
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 26]: ` But for my uncle 's sake , I would knock you down for daring to couple such a word with _ him _ . '
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 8]: He turned on me with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 15]: His eyes had receded in his head , and in his rage he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 35]: The old ape-face , which had lurked in my memory ever since the time I first saw him , came out so plainly that I started : the child had read his face aright !
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 10]: the following judgment of the man had been wrong !
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 15]: the child 's fear had not imprinted a false eidolon upon the growing brain .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 24]: ` What right had , you , ' he said , ` to bring me all this way for such tomfoolery ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 10]: I told you it would not further your wishes .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 11]: -- But who brought me here for nothing first ? '
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 7]: I added , most foolishly . '
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 5]: I was myself deceived .
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 10]: I did not intend to deceive you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 4]: I know that .
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 9]: God forbid I should be unjust to you !
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 23]: But you have proved to me that your friendship was all a pretence ; that your private ends were all your object .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 25]: When you discovered that I could not serve those , you dropped me like a bit of glass you had taken for a diamond .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 18]: Have you any right to grumble if I give you the discipline of a passing shame ? '
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 19]: ` Mr Cumbermede , ' he said , through his teeth , ` you will repent this . '
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 14]: I gave him no answer , and he left the church in haste .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 24]: Having replaced the register , I was following at my leisure , when I heard sounds that made me hurry to the door .
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 24]: Lilith was plunging and rearing and pulling at the bridle which I had thrown over one of the spiked bars of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 47]: Another moment and she must have broken loose , or dragged the gate upon her -- more likely the latter , for the bridle was a new one with broad reins -- when some frightful injury would in all probability have been the consequence to herself .
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 16]: But a word from me quieted her , and she stood till I came up .
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 7]: Every inch of her was trembling .
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 39]: I suspected at once , and in a moment discovered plainly that Mr Coningham had struck her with his whip : there was a big weal on the fine skin of her hip and across , her croup .
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 21]: She shrunk like a hurt child when my hand approached the injured part , but moved neither hoof nor head .
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 18]: Having patted and petted and consoled her a little , I mounted and rode after Mr Coningham .
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 15]: Nor was it difficult to overtake him , for he was going a foot-pace .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 22]: He was stooping in his saddle , and when I drew near , I saw that he was looking very pale .
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 13]: I did not , however , suspect that he was in pain .
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 17]: ` It was a cowardly thing to strike the poor dumb animal , ' I cried .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 24]: ` You would have struck her yourself , ' he answered with a curse , ' if she had broken your leg . '
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 4]: I rode nearer .
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 39]: I knew well enough that she would not have kicked him if he had not struck her first ; and I could see that his leg was not broken ; but evidently he was in great suffering . '
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 9]: I am very sorry , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 6]: Can I help you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 7]: ` Go to the devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 17]: I am ashamed to say the answer made me so angry that I spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 13]: ` Do n't suppose you deceive me , ' I said . '
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 15]: I know well enough my mare did not kick you before you struck her .
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 9]: Then she lashed out , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 29]: I waited for no reply , but turned and rode back to the church , the door of which , in my haste , I had left open .
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 14]: I locked it , replaced the key , and then rode quietly home .
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 15]: But as I went , I began to feel that I had done wrong .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 17]: No doubt , Mr Coningham deserved it , but the law was not in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 11]: No man has a right to _ punish _ another .
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 23]: Vengeance belongs to a higher region , and the vengeance of God is a very different thing from the vengeance of man .
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 32]: However it may be softened with the name of retribution , revenge runs into all our notions of justice ; and until we love purely , so it must ever be .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 11]: All I had gained was self-rebuke , and another enemy .
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 42]: Having reached home , I read the Manual of Epictetus right through before I laid it down , and , if it did not teach me to love my enemies , it taught me at least to be ashamed of myself .
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 56]: Then I wrote to Mr Coningham , saying I was sorry I had spoken to him as I did , and begging him to let by-gones be by-gones ; assuring him that , if ever I moved in the matter of our difference , he should be the first to whom I applied for assistance .
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 6]: He returned me no answer .
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIII .
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 3]: A COLLISION .
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 9]: And now came a dreary time of re-action .
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 16]: There seemed nothing left for me to do , and I felt listless and weary .
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 27]: Something kept urging me to get away and hide myself , and I soon made up my mind to yield to the impulse and go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 26]: My intention was to avoid cities , and , wandering from village to village , lay my soul bare to the healing influences of nature .
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 31]: As to any healing in the power of Time , I despised the old bald-pate as a quack who performed his seeming cures at the expense of the whole body .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 23]: The better cures attributed to him are not his at all , but produced by the operative causes whose servant he is .
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 24]: A thousand holy balms require his services for their full action , but they , and not he , are the saving powers .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 26]: Along with Time I ranked , and with absolute hatred shrunk from -- all those means which offered to cure me by making me forget .
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 38]: From a child I had a horror of forgetting ; it always seemed to me like a loss of being , like a hollow scooped out of my very existence -- almost like the loss of identity .
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 39]: At times I even shrunk from going to sleep , so much did it seem like yielding to an absolute death -- a death so deep that the visible death is but a picture or type of it .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 26]: If I could have been sure of dreaming , it would have been different , but in the uncertainty it seemed like consenting to nothingness .
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 70]: That one who thus felt should ever have been tempted to suicide , will reveal how painful if not valueless his thoughts and feelings -- his conscious life -- must have grown to him ; and that the only thing which withheld him from it should be the fear that no death , but a more intense life might be the result , will reveal it yet more clearly .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 15]: That in that sleep I might at least dream -- there was the rub .
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 33]: All such relief , in a word , as might come of a lowering of my life , either physically , morally , or spiritually , I hated , detested , despised .
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 43]: The man who finds solace for a wounded heart in self-indulgence may indeed be _ capable _ of angelic virtues , but in the mean time his conduct is that of the devils who went into the swine rather than be bodiless .
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 36]: The man who can thus be consoled for the loss of a woman could never have been worthy of her , possibly would not have remained true to her beyond the first delights of possession .
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 30]: The relief to which I could open my door must be such alone as would operate through the enlarging and elevating of what I recognized as _ myself _ .
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 40]: Whatever would make me greater , so that my torture , intensified , it might well be , should yet have room to dash itself hither and thither without injuring the walls of my being , would be welcome .
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 39]: If I might become so great that , my grief yet stinging me to agony , the infinite _ I _ of me should remain pure and calm , God-loving and man-cherishing , then I should be saved .
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 21]: God might be able to do more for me -- I could not tell : I looked for no more .
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 34]: I would myself be such as to inclose my pain in a mighty sphere of out-spacing life , in relation to which even such sorrow as mine should be but a little thing .
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 44]: Such deliverance alone , I say , could I consent with myself to accept , and such alone , I believed , would God offer me -- for such alone seemed worthy of him , and such alone seemed not unworthy of me .
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 17]: The help that Nature could give me , I judged to be of this ennobling kind .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 46]: For either nature was nature in virtue of having been born -LRB- _ nata _ -RRB- of God , or she was but a phantasm of my own brain -- against which supposition the nature in me protested with the agony of a tortured man .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 9]: To nature , then , I would go .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 27]: Like the hurt child who folds himself in the skirt of his mother 's velvet garment , I would fold myself in the robe of Deity .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 23]: But to give honour and gratitude where both are due , I must here confess obligation with a willing and thankful heart .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 44]: The _ Excursion _ of Wordsworth was published ere I was born , but only since I left college had I made acquaintance with it : so long does it take for the light of a new star to reach a distant world !
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 23]: To this book I owe so much that to me it would alone justify the conviction that Wordsworth will never be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 14]: That he is no longer the fashion , militates nothing against his reputation .
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 33]: We , the old ones , hold fast by him for no sentimental reminiscence of the fashion of our youth , but simply because his humanity has come into contact with ours .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 45]: The men of the new generation have their new loves and worships : it remains to be seen to whom the worthy amongst them will turn long ere the frosts of age begin to gather and the winds of the human autumn to blow .
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 36]: Wordsworth will recede through the gliding ages until , with the greater Chaucer , and the greater Shakspere , and the greater Milton , he is yet a star in the constellated crown of England .
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 15]: Before I was able to leave home , however , a new event occurred .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 14]: I received an anonymous letter , in a hand-writing I did not recognize .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 16]: Its contents were as follows : -- ` SIR , -- Treachery is intended you .
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 13]: If you have anything worth watching , _ watch _ it . '
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 34]: For one moment -- so few were the places in which through my possessions I was vulnerable -- I fancied the warning might point to Lilith , but I soon dismissed the idea .
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 24]: I could make no inquiries , for it had been left an hour before my return from a stroll by an unknown messenger .
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 42]: I could think of nothing besides but the register , and if this was what my correspondent aimed at , I had less reason to be anxious concerning it , because of the attested copy , than my informant probably knew .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 14]: Still its safety was far from being a matter of indifference to me .
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 20]: I resolved to ride over to Umberden Church , and see if it was as I had left it .
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 14]: The twilight was fast thickening into darkness when I entered the gloomy building .
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 39]: There was light enough , however , to guide my hand to the right volume , and by carrying it to the door , I was able to satisfy myself that it was as I had left it .
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 45]: Thinking over the matter once more as I stood , I could not help wishing that the book were out of danger just for the present ; but there was hardly a place in the bare church where it was possible to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 50]: At last I thought of one -- half groped my way to the pulpit , ascended its creaking stair , lifted the cushion of the seat , and laid the book , which was thin , open in the middle , and flat on its face , under it .
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 12]: I then locked the door , mounted , and rode off .
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 7]: It was now more than dusk .
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 26]: Lilith was frolicsome , and , rejoicing in the grass under her feet , broke into a quick canter along the noiseless , winding lane .
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 12]: Suddenly there was a great shock , and I lay senseless .
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 20]: I came to myself under the stinging blows of a whip , only afterwards recognized as such , however .
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 35]: I sprung staggering to my feet , and rushed at the dim form of an assailant , with such a sudden and , I suppose , unexpected assault , that he fell under me .
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 29]: Had he not fallen I should have had little chance with him , for , as I now learned by his voice , it was Sir Geoffrey Brotherton .
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 3]: ` Thief !
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 2]: Swindler !
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 3]: Sneak ! '
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 14]: he cried , making a last harmless blow at me as he fell .
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 10]: All the wild beast in my nature was roused .
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 16]: I had no weapon -- not even a whip , for Lilith never needed one .
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 26]: It was well , for what I might have done in the first rush of blood to my reviving brain , I dare hardly imagine .
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 24]: I seized him by the throat with such fury that , though far the stronger , he had no chance as he lay .
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 6]: I kneeled on his chest .
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 14]: He struggled furiously , but could not force my gripe from his throat .
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 14]: I soon perceived that I was strangling him , and tightened my grasp .
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 24]: His efforts were already growing feebler , when I became aware of a soft touch apparently trying to take hold of my hair .
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 18]: Glancing up without relaxing my hold , I saw the white head of Lilith close to mine .
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 53]: Was it the whiteness -- was it the calmness of the creature -- I can not pretend to account for the fact , but the same instant before my mind 's eye rose the vision of one standing speechless before his accusers , bearing on his form the marks of ruthless blows .
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 35]: I did not then remember that just before I came out I had been gazing , as I often gazed , upon an Ecce Homo of Albert Dürer 's that hung in my room .
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 7]: Immediately my heart awoke within me .
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 21]: My whole being still trembling with passionate struggle and gratified hate , a rush of human pity swept across it .
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 21]: I took my hand from my enemy 's throat , rose , withdrew some paces , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 21]: I could have embraced him , but I dared not even minister to him for the insult at would appear .
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 28]: He did not at once rise , and when he did , he stood for a few moments , half-unconscious , I think , staring at me .
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 41]: Coming to himself , he felt for and found his whip -- I thought with the intention of attacking me again , but he moved towards his horse , which was quietly eating the grass , now wet with dew .
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 20]: Gathering its bridle from around its leg , he mounted , and rode back the way he had come .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 8]: I lingered for a while utterly exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 7]: I was trembling in every limb .
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 24]: The moon rose and began to shed her low yellow light over the hazel copse , filling the lane with brightness and shadow .
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 43]: Lilith , seeming-in her whiteness to gather a tenfold share of the light upon herself , was now feeding as gently as if she had known nothing of the strife , and I congratulated myself that the fall had not injured her .
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 22]: But as she took a step forward in her feeding , I discovered to my dismay that she was quite lame .
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 16]: For my own part I was now feeling the ache of numerous and severe bruises .
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 27]: When I took Lilith by the bridle to lead her away , I found that neither of us could manage more than two miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 7]: I was very uneasy about her .
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 18]: There was nothing for it , however , but make the best of our way to Gastford .
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 43]: It was no little satisfaction to think , as we hobbled along , that the accident had happened through no carelessness of mine , beyond that of cantering in the dark , for I was on my own side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 19]: Had Geoffrey been on his , narrow as the lane was , we might have passed without injury .
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 24]: It was so late when we reached Gastford , that we had to rouse the ostler before I could get Lilith attended to .
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 31]: I bathed the injured leg , of which the shoulder seemed wrenched ; and having fed her , but less plentifully than usual , I left her to her repose .
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 50]: In the morning she was considerably better , but I resolved to leave her where she was , and , sending a messenger for Styles to come and attend to her , I hired a gig , and went to call on my new friend the rector of Umberden .
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 16]: I told him all that had happened , and where I had left the volume .
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 34]: He said he would have a chest made in which to secure the whole register , and , meanwhile , would himself go to the church and bring that volume home with him .
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 26]: It is safe enough now , as any one may find who wishes to see it -- though the old man has long passed away .
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 17]: Lilith remained at Gastford a week before I judged it safe for her to come home .
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 15]: The injury , however , turned out to be a not very serious one .
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 25]: Why should I write of my poor mare -- but that she was once hers all for whose hoped perusal I am writing this ?
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 46]: No , there is even a better reason : I shall never , to all my eternity , forget , even if I should never see her again , which I do not for a moment believe , what she did for me that evening .
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 13]: Surely she deserves to appear in her own place in my story !
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 17]: Of course I was exercised in my mind as to who had sent me the warning .
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 27]: There could be no more doubt that I had hit what it intended , and had possibly preserved the register from being once more tampered with .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 7]: I could think only of one .
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 30]: I have never had an opportunity of inquiring , and for her sake I should never have asked the question , but I have little doubt it was Clara .
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 26]: Who else could have had a chance of making the discovery , and at the same time would have cared to let me know it ?
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 17]: Also she would have cogent reason for keeping such a part in the affair a secret .
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 26]: Probably she had heard her father informing Geoffrey ; but he might have done so with no worse intention than had informed his previous policy .
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIV .
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 3]: YET ONCE .
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 9]: I am drawing my story to a close .
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 23]: Almost all that followed bears so exclusively upon my internal history , that I will write but one incident more of it .
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 11]: I have roamed the world , and reaped many harvests .
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 16]: In the deepest agony I have never refused the consolations of Nature or of Truth .
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 17]: I have never knowingly accepted any founded in falsehood , in forgetfulness , or in distraction .
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 28]: Let such as have no hope in God drink of what Lethe they can find ; to me it is a river of Hell and altogether abominable .
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 11]: I could not be content even to forget my sins .
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 22]: There can be but one deliverance from them , namely , that God and they should come together in my soul .
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 9]: In his presence I shall serenely face them .
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 9]: Without him I dare not think of them .
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 31]: With God a man can confront anything ; without God , he is but the withered straw which the sickle of the reaper has left standing on a wintry field .
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 23]: But to forget them would be to cease and begin anew , which to one aware of his immortality is a horror .
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 25]: If comfort profound as the ocean has not yet overtaken and infolded me , I see how such may come -- perhaps will come .
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 131]: It must be by the enlarging of my whole being in truth , in God , so as to give room for the storm to rage , yet not destroy ; for the sorrow to brood , yet not kill ; for the sunshine of love to return after the east wind and black frost of bitterest disappointment ; for the heart to feel the uttermost tenderness while the arms go not forth to embrace ; for a mighty heaven of the unknown , crowded with the stars of endless possibilities , to dawn when the sun of love has vanished , and the moon of its memory is too ghastly to give any light : it is comfort such and thence that I think will one day possess me .
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 13]: Already has not its aurora brightened the tops of my snow-covered mountains ?
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 25]: And if yet my valleys lie gloomy and forlorn , is not light on the loneliest peak a sure promise of the coming day ?
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 11]: Only once again have I looked in Mary 's face .
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 12]: I will record the occasion , and then drop my pen .
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 28]: About five years after I left home , I happened in my wanderings to be in one of my favourite Swiss valleys -- high and yet sheltered .
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 61]: I rejoiced to be far up in the mountains , yet behold the inaccessible peaks above me -- mine , though not to be trodden by foot of mine -- my heart 's own , though never to yield me a moment 's outlook from their lofty brows ; for I was never strong enough to reach one mighty summit .
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 44]: It was enough for me that they sent me down the glad streams from the cold bosoms of their glaciers -- the offspring of the sun and the snow ; that I too beheld the stars to which they were nearer than I .
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 51]: One lovely morning I had wandered a good way from the village -- a place little frequented by visitors , where I had a lodging in the house of the syndic -- when I was overtaken by one of the sudden fogs which so frequently render those upper regions dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 50]: There was no path to guide me back to my temporary home , but , a hundred yards or so beneath where I had been sitting , lay that which led down to one of the best known villages of the canton , where I could easily find shelter .
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 6]: I made haste to descend .
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 60]: After a couple of hours ' walking , during which the fog kept following me , as if hunting me from its lair , I at length arrived at the level of the valley , and was soon in one of those large hotels which in Summer are crowded as bee-hives , and in Winter forsaken as a ruin .
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 19]: The season for travellers was drawing to a close , and the house was full of homeward-bound guests .
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 11]: For the mountains will endure but a season of intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 45]: If travellers linger too long within their hospitable gates , their humour changes , and , with fierce winds and snow and bitter sleet , they will drive them forth , preserving their Winter privacy for the bosom friends of their mistress , Nature .
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 36]: Many is the Winter since those of my boyhood which I have spent amongst the Alps ; and in such solitude I have ever found the negation of all solitude , the one absolute Presence .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 54]: David communed with his own heart on his bed and was still -- there finding God : communing with my own heart in the Winter-valleys of Switzerland I found at least what made me cry out : ` Surely this is the house of God ; this is the gate of heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 63]: I would not be supposed to fancy that God is in mountains , and not in plains -- that God is in the solitude , and not in the city : in any region harmonious with its condition and necessities , it is easier , for the heart to be still , and in its stillness to hear the still small voice .
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 10]: Dinner was going on at the _ table-d'hôte _ .
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 15]: It was full , but a place was found for me in a bay-window .
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 62]: Turning to the one side , I belonged to the great world , represented by the Germans , Americans , and English , with a Frenchman and Italian here and there , filling the long table ; turning to the other , I knew myself in a temple of the Most High , so huge that it seemed empty of men .
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 48]: The great altar of a mighty mountain rose , massy as a world , and ethereal as a thought , into the upturned gulf of the twilight air -- its snowy peak , ever as I turned to look , mounting up and up to its repose .
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 73]: I had been playing with my own soul , spinning it between the sun and the moon , as it were , and watching now the golden and now the silvery side , as I glanced from the mountain to the table , and again from the table to the mountain , when all at once I discovered that I was searching the mountain for something -- I did not know what .
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 59]: Whether any tones had reached me , I can not tell ; -- a man 's mind may , even through his senses , be marvellously moved without knowing whence the influence comes ; -- but there I was searching the face of the mountain for something , with a want which had not begun to explain itself .
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 15]: From base to peak my eyes went flitting and resting and wandering again upwards .
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 18]: At last they reached the snowy crown , from which they fell into the infinite blue beyond .
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 12]: Then , suddenly , the unknown something I wanted was clear .
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 9]: The same moment I turned to the table .
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 19]: Almost opposite was a face -- pallid , with parted lips and fixed eyes -- gazing at me .
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 23]: Then I knew those eyes had been gazing at me all the time I had been searching the face of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 47]: For one moment they met mine and rested ; for one moment , I felt as if I must throw myself at her feet , and clasp them to my heart ; but she turned her eyes away , and I rose and left the house .
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 11]: The mist was gone , and the moon was rising .
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 10]: I walked up the mountain path towards my village .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 11]: But long ere I reached it the sun was rising .
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 49]: With his first arrow of slenderest light , the tossing waves of my spirit began to lose their white tops , and sink again towards a distant calm ; and ere I saw the village from the first point of vision , I had made the following verses .
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 9]: They are the last I will set down .
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 57]: I know that I can not move thee To an echo of my pain , Or a thrill of the storming trouble That racks my soul and brain ; That our hearts through all the ages Shall never sound in tune ; That they meet no more in their cycles Than the parted sun and moon .
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 53]: But if ever a spirit flashes Itself on another soul , One day , in thy stillness , a vapour Shall round about thee roll ; And the lifting of the vapour Shall reveal a world of pain , Of frosted suns , and moons that wander Through misty mountains of rain .
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 32]: Thou shalt know me for one live instant -- Thou halt know me -- and yet not love : I would not have thee troubled , My cold , white-feathered dove !
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 26]: I would only once come near thee -- Myself , and not my form ; Then away in the distance wander , A slow-dissolving storm .
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 25]: The vision should pass in vapour , That melts in aether again ; Only a something linger-Not pain , but the shadow of pain .
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 27]: And I should know that thy spirit On mine one look had sent ; And glide away from thy knowledge , And try to be half-content .
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXV .
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 2]: CONCLUSION .
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 16]: The ebbing tide that leaves bare the shore swells the heaps of the central sea .
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 54]: The tide of life ebbs from this body of mine , soon to lie on the shore of life like a stranded wreck ; but the murmur of the waters that break upon no strand is in my ears ; to join the waters of the infinite life , mine is ebbing away .
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 36]: Whatever has been his will is well -- grandly well -- well even for that in me which feared , and in those very respects in which it feared that it might not be well .
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 24]: The whole being of me past and present shall say : It is infinitely well , and I would not have it otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 38]: Rather than it should not be as it is , I would go back to the world and this body of which I grew weary , and encounter yet again all that met me on my journey .
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 22]: Yes -- final submission of my will to the All-will -- I would meet it _ knowing what was coming _ .
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 13]: Lord of me , Father of Jesus Christ , will this suffice ?
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 6]: Is my faith enough yet ?
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 41]: I say it , not having beheld what thou hast in store -- not knowing what I shall be -- not even absolutely certain that thou art -- confident only that , if thou be , such thou must be .
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 7]: The last struggle is before me .
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 41]: But I have passed already through so many valleys of death itself , where the darkness was not only palpable , but choking and stinging , that I can not greatly fear that which holds but the shadow of death .
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 11]: For what men call death , is but its shadow .
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 21]: Death never comes near us ; it lies behind the back of God ; he is between it and us .
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 36]: If he were to turn his back upon us , the death which no imagination can shadow forth , would lap itself around us , and we should be -- we should not know what .
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 35]: At night I lie wondering how it will feel ; and , but that God will be with me , I would rather be slain suddenly , than lie still and await the change .
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 80]: The growing weakness , ushered in , it may be , by long agony ; the alienation from things about me , while I am yet amidst them ; the slow rending of the bonds which make this body a home , so that it turns half alien , while yet some bonds unsevered hold the live thing fluttering in its worm-eaten cage -- but God knows me and my house , and I need not speculate or forebode .
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 12]: When it comes , death will prove as natural as birth .
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 11]: Bethink thee , Lord -- nay , thou never forgettest .
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 43]: It is because thou thinkest and feelest that I think and feel ; it is on thy deeper consciousness that mine ever floats ; thou knowest my frame , and rememberest that I am dust : do with me as thou wilt .
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 18]: Let me take centuries to die if so thou willest , for thou wilt be with me .
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 37]: Only if an hour should come when thou must seem to forsake me , watch me all the time , lest self-pity should awake , and I should cry that thou wast dealing hardly with me .
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 23]: For when thou hidest thy face , the world is a corpse , and I am a live soul fainting within it .
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 45]: * * * * * Thus far had I written , and was about to close with certain words of Job , which are to me like the trumpet of the resurrection , when the news reached me that Sir Geoffrey Brotherton was dead .
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 20]: He leaves no children , and the property is expected to pass to a distant branch of the family .
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 8]: Mary will have to leave Moldwarp Hall .
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 25]: * * * * * I have been up to London to my friend Marston -- for it is years since Mr Coningham died .
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 15]: I have laid everything before him , and left the affair in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 38]: He is so confident in my cause , that he offers , in case my means should fail me , to find what is necessary himself ; but he is almost as confident of a speedy settlement .
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 23]: And now , for the first time in my life , I am about -- shall I say , to court society ?
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 28]: At least I am going to London , about to give and receive invitations , and cultivate the acquaintance of those whose appearance and conversation attract me .
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 39]: I have not a single relative , to my knowledge , in the world , and I am free , beyond question , to leave whatever property I have , or may have , to whomsoever I please .
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 22]: My design is this : if I succeed in my suit , I will offer Moldwarp to Mary for her lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 23]: She is greatly beloved in the county , and has done much for the labourers , nor upon her own lands only .
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 12]: If she had the full power she would do yet better .
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 13]: But of course it is very doubtful whether she will accept it .
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 37]: Should she decline it , I shall try to manage it myself -- leaving it to her , with reversion to the man , whoever he may be , whom I shall choose to succeed her .
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 17]: What sort of man I shall endeavour to find , I think my reader will understand .
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 30]: I will not describe him , beyond saying that he must above all things be just , generous , and free from the petty prejudices of the country gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 54]: He must understand that property involves service to every human soul that lives or labours upon it -- the service of the elder brother to his less burdened yet more enduring and more helpless brothers and sisters ; that for the lives of all such he has in his degree to render account .
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 80]: For surely God never meant to uplift any man _ at the expense _ of his fellows ; but to uplift him that he might be strong to minister , as a wise friend and ruler , to their highest and best needs -- first of all by giving them the justice which will be recognized as such by him before whom a man _ is _ his brother 's keeper , and becomes a Cain in denying it .
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 24]: Lest Lady Brotherton , however , should like to have something to give away , I leave my former will as it was .
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 7]: It is in Marston 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 15]: * * * * * Would I marry her now , if I might ?
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 5]: I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 9]: The thought rouses no passionate flood within me .
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 12]: Mighty spaces of endless possibility and endless result open before me .
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 7]: Death is knocking at my door .
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 21]: -- No -- no ; I will be honest , and lay it to no half reasons , however wise .

Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 14]: That , Geoffrey has never touched ; over that he has no claim .
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 21]: But if the loveliness of her character should have purified his , and drawn and bound his soul to hers ?
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 7]: Father , fold me in thyself .
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 17]: The storm , so long still , awakes ; once more it flutters its fierce pinions .
