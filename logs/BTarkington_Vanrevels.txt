Parsing [sent. 1 len. 9]: THE TWO VANREVELS By Booth Tarkington CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 86]: A Cat Can Do More than Look at a King It was long ago in the days when men sighed when they fell in love ; when people danced by candle and lamp , and did dance , too , instead of solemnly gliding about ; in that mellow time so long ago , when the young were romantic and summer was roses and wine , old Carewe brought his lovely daughter home from the convent to wreck the hearts of the youth of Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 68]: That was not a far journey ; only an afternoon 's drive through the woods and by the river , in an April , long ago ; Miss Betty 's harp carefully strapped behind the great lumbering carriage , her guitar on the front seat , half-buried under a mound of bouquets and oddly shaped little bundles , farewell gifts of her comrades and the good Sisters .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 112]: In her left hand she clutched a small lace handkerchief , with which she now and then touched her eyes , brimmed with the parting from Sister Cecilia , Sister Mary Bazilede , the old stone steps and all the girls : but for every time that she lifted the dainty kerchief to brush away the edge of a tear , she took a deep breath of the Western woodland air and smiled at least twice ; for the years of strict inclosure within St. Mary 's walls and still gardens were finished and done with , and at last the many-colored world flashed and danced in a mystery before her .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 19]: This mystery was brilliant to the convent-girl because it contained men ; she was eager to behold it .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 43]: They rumbled into town after sunset , in the fair twilight , the dogs barking before them , and everyone would have been surprised to know that Tom Vanrevel , instead of Mr. Crailey Gray , was the first to see her .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 86]: By the merest accident , Tom was strolling near the Carewe place at the time ; and when the carriage swung into the gates , with rattle and clink and clouds of dust at the finish , it was not too soon lost behind the shrubbery and trees for Tom to catch something more than a glimpse of a gray skirt behind a mound of flowers , and of a charming face with parted lips and dark eyes beneath the scuttle of an enormous bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 30]: It happened -- perhaps it is more accurate to say that Tom thought it happened -- that she was just clearing away her veil when he turned to look .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 52]: She blushed suddenly , so much was not to be mistaken ; and the eyes that met his were remarkable for other reasons than the sheer loveliness of them , in that , even in the one flash of them he caught , they meant so many things at one time .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 44]: They were sparkling , yet mournful ; and they were wistful , although undeniably lively with the gayest comprehension of the recipient of their glance , seeming to say , `` Oh , it 's you , young man , is it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 35]: And they were shy and mysterious with youth , full of that wonder at the world which has the appearance , sometimes , of wisdom gathered in the unknown out of which we came .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 14]: But , above all , these eyes were fully conscious of Tom Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 11]: Without realizing what he did , Mr. Vanrevel stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 21]: He had been swinging a walkingstick , which , describing a brief arc , remained poised half-way in its descent .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 24]: There was only that one glance between them ; and the carriage disappeared , leaving a scent of spring flowers in the air .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 42]: The young man was left standing on the wooden pavement in the midst of a great loneliness , yet enveloped in the afterglow , his soul roseate , his being quavering , his expression , like his cane , instantaneously arrested .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 53]: With such promptitude and finish was he disposed of , that , had Miss Carewe been aware of his name and the condition wrought in him by the single stroke , she could have sought only the terse Richard of England for a like executive ability , `` Off with his head !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 6]: So much for Vanrevel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 26]: She had lifted a slender hand to the fluttering veil , a hand in a white glove with a small lace gauntlet at the wrist .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 127]: This gesture was the final divinity of the radiant vision which remained with the dazed young man as he went down the street ; and it may have been three-quarters of an hour later when the background of the picture became vivid to him : a carefully dressed gentleman with heavy brows and a handsome high nose , who sat stiffly upright beside the girl , his very bright eyes quite as conscious of the stricken pedestrian as were hers , vastly different , however , in this : that they glittered , nay , almost bristled , with hostility ; while every polished button of his blue coat seemed to reflect their malignancy , and to dart little echoing shafts of venom at Mr. Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 104]: Tom was dismayed by the acuteness of his perception that a man who does not speak to you has no right to have a daughter like the lady in the carriage ; and , the moment of this realization occurring as he sat making a poor pretence to eat his evening meal at the `` Rouen House , '' he dropped his fork rattling upon his plate and leaned back , staring at nothing , a proceeding of which his table-mate , Mr. William Cummings , the editor of the Rouen Journal , was too busy over his river bass to take note .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 11]: `` Have you heard what 's new in town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 7]: asked Cummings presently , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 21]: `` No , '' said Tom truthfully , for he had seen what was new , but not heard it .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: `` Old Carewe 's brought his daughter home .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 28]: Fanchon Bareaud was with her at St. Mary 's until last year and Fanchon says she 's not only a great beauty but a great dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 7]: rejoined the other with masterly indifference .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 8]: `` Dare say -- dare say . ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 21]: `` No wonder you 're not interested , '' said Cummings cheerfully , returning to the discussion of his bass .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 17]: `` The old villain will take precious good care you do n't come near her . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 12]: Mr. Vanrevel already possessed a profound conviction to the same effect .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 42]: Robert Meilhac Carewe was known not only as the wealthiest citizen of Rouen , but also as its heartiest and most steadfast hater : and , although there were only five or six thousand inhabitants , neither was a small distinction .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 41]: For Rouen was ranked , in those easy days , as a wealthy town ; even as it was called an old town ; proud of its age and its riches , and bitter in its politics , of course .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 38]: The French had built a fort there , soon after LaSalle 's last voyage , and , as Crailey Gray said , had settled the place , and had then been settled themselves by the pioneer militia .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 45]: After the Revolution , Carolinians and Virginians had come , by way of Tennessee and Kentucky ; while the adventurous countrymen from Connecticut , travelling thither to sell , remained to buy -- and then sell -- when the country was in its teens .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 60]: In course of time the little trading-post of the Northwest Territory had grown to be the leading centre of elegance and culture in the Ohio Valley -- at least they said so in Rouen ; only a few people in the country , such as Mr. Irving of Tarrytown , for instance , questioning whether a centre could lead .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 83]: The pivotal figure , though perhaps not the heart , of this centre , was unquestionably Mr. Carewe , and about him the neat and tight aristocracy of the place revolved ; the old French remnant , having liberally intermarried , forming the nucleus , together with descendants of the Cavaliers -LRB- and those who said they were -RRB- and the industrious Yankees , by virtue -LRB- if not by the virtues -RRB- of all whom , the town grew and prospered .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 30]: Robert Carewe was Rouen 's magnate , commercially and socially , and , until an upstart young lawyer named Vanrevel struck into his power with a broad-axe , politically .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 53]: The wharves were Carewe 's ; the warehouses that stood by the river , and the line of packets which plied upon it , were his ; half the town was his , and in Rouen this meant that he was possessed of the Middle Justice , the High and the Low .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 69]: His mother was a Frenchwoman , and , in those days , when to go abroad was a ponderous and venturesome undertaking , the fact that he had spent most of his youth in the French capital wrought a certain glamour about him ; for to the American , Paris was Europe , and it lay shimmering on the far horizon of every imagination , a golden city .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 64]: Scarce a drawing-room in Rouen lacked its fearsome engraving entitled `` Grand Ball at the Tuileries , '' nor was Godey 's Magazine ever more popular than when it contained articles elaborate of similar scenes of festal light , where brilliant uniforms mingled with shining jewels , fair locks , and the white shoulders of magnificently dressed duchesses , countesses , and ladies .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 13]: Credit for this description should be given entirely to the above-mentioned periodical .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 39]: Furthermore , a sojourn in Paris was held to confer a `` certain nameless and indescribable polish '' upon the manners of the visitor ; also , there was something called `` an air of foreign travel . ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 68]: They talked a great deal about polish in those days ; and some examples still extant do not deny their justification ; but in the case of Mr. Carewe , there existed a citizen of Rouen , one already quoted , who had the temerity to declare the polish to be in truth quite nameless and indescribable for the reason that one can not paint a vacuum .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 61]: However , subscription to this opinion should not be over-hasty , since Mr. Crailey Gray had been notoriously a rival of Carewe 's with every pretty woman in town , both having the same eye in such matters , and also because the slandered gentleman could assume a manner when he chose to , whether or not he possessed it .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 25]: At his own table he exhaled a hospitable graciousness which , from a man of known evil temper , carried the winsomeness of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 51]: When he wooed , it was with an air of stately devotion , combined with that knowingness which sometimes offsets for a widower the tendency a girl has to giggle at him ; and the combination had been , once or twice , too much for even the alluring Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 20]: Mr. Carewe lived in an old-fashioned house on the broad , quiet , shady street which bore his name .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 21]: There was a wide lawn in front , shadowy under elm and locust trees , and bounded by thick shrubberies .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 81]: A long garden , fair with roses and hollyhocks , lay outside the library windows , an old-time garden , with fine gravel paths and green arbors ; drowsed over in summer-time by the bees , while overhead the locust rasped his rusty cadences the livelong day ; and a faraway sounding love-note from the high branches brought to mind the line , like an old refrain : `` The voice of the turtle was heard in the land . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 38]: Between the garden and the carriage gates there was a fountain where a bronze boy with the dropsy -LRB- but not minding it -RRB- lived in a perpetual bath from a green goblet held over his head .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 30]: Nearby , a stone sun-dial gleamed against a clump of lilac bushes ; and it was upon this spot that the white kitten introduced Thomas Vanrevel to Miss Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 80]: Upon the morning after her arrival , having finished her piano-forte practice , touched her harp twice , and arpeggioed the Spanish Fandango on her guitar , Miss Betty read two paragraphs of `` Gilbert '' -LRB- for she was profoundly determined to pursue her tasks with diligence -RRB- , but the open windows disclosing a world all sunshine and green leaves , she threw the book aside with a good conscience , and danced out to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 61]: There , coming upon a fuzzy , white ball rolling into itself spirally on a lazy pathway , she pounced at it , whereupon the thing uncurled with lightning swiftness , and fled , more like a streak than a kitten , down the drive , through the open gates and into the street , Miss Betty in full cry .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 39]: Across the way there chanced to be strolling a young lady in blue , accompanied by a gentleman whose leisurely gait gave no indication of the maneuvering he had done to hasten their walk into its present direction .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 77]: He was apparently thirty or thirty-one , tall , very straight , dark , smooth-shaven , his eyes keen , deep-set , and thoughtful , and his high white hat , white satin cravat , and careful collar , were evidence of an elaboration of toilet somewhat unusual in Rouen for the morning ; also , he was carrying a pair of white gloves in his hand and dangled a slender ebony cane from his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 49]: The flying kitten headed toward the couple , when , with a celerity only to be accounted for on the theory that his eye had been fixed on the Carewe gateway for some time previous to this sudden apparition , the gentleman leaped in front of the fugitive .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 15]: The kitten attempted a dodge to pass ; the gentleman was there before it .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: The kitten feinted ; the gentleman was altogether too much on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 68]: Immediately -- and just as Miss Carewe , flushed and glowing , ran into the street -- the small animal doubled , evaded Miss Betty 's frantic clutch , re-entered the gateway , and attempted a disappearance into the lilac bushes , instead of going round them , only to find itself , for a fatal two seconds , in difficulties with the close-set thicket of stems .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 25]: In regard to the extraordinary agility of which the pursuing gentleman as capable , it is enough to say that he caught the cat .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 36]: He emerged from the lilacs holding it in one hand , his gloves and white hat in the other , and presented himself before Miss Betty with a breathlessness not entirely attributable to his exertions .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 28]: For a moment , as she came running toward him and he met her flashing look , bright with laughter and recognition and haste , he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 35]: A thrill nothing less than delirious sent the blood up behind his brown cheeks , for he saw that she , too , knew that this was the second time their eyes had met .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 85]: Naturally , at that time he could not know how many other gentlemen were to feel that same thrill -LRB- in their cases , also , delirious , no less -RRB- with the same , accompanying , mysterious feeling , which came just before Miss Betty 's lashes fell , that one had found , at last , a precious thing , lost long since in childhood , or left , perhaps , upon some other planet in a life ten thousand years ago .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 34]: He could not speak at once , but when he could , `` Permit me , madam , '' he said solemnly , offering the captive , `` to restore your kitten . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 22]: An agitated kitten should not be detained by clasping its waist , and already the conqueror was paying for his victory .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 38]: There ensued a final , outrageous squirm of despair ; two frantic claws , extended , drew one long red mark across the stranger 's wrist and another down the back of his hand to the knuckles .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 45]: They were good , hearty scratches , and the blood followed the artist 's lines rapidly ; but of this the young man took no note , for he knew that he was about to hear Miss Carewe 's voice for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 24]: `` They say the best way to hold them , '' he observed , `` is by the scruff of the neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 27]: Beholding his wounds , suffered in her cause , she gave a pitying cry that made his heart leap with the richness and sweetness of it .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 30]: Catching the kitten from him , she dropped it to the ground in such wise as to prove nature 's foresight most kind in cushioning the feet of cats .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 9]: I did n't want it that much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 22]: `` A cat in the hand is worth two nightingales in the bush , '' he said boldly , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 10]: `` I would shed more blood than that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: Miss Betty blushed like a southern dawn , and started back from him .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 19]: From the convent but yesterday -- and she had taken a man 's hand in both of hers !
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 27]: It was to this tableau that the lady in blue entered , following the hunt through the gates , where she stopped with a discomposed countenance .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 32]: At once , however , she advanced , and with a cry of greeting , enveloped Miss Betty in a brief embrace , to the relief of the latter 's confusion .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 20]: It was Fanchon Bareaud , now two years emancipated from St. Mary 's , and far gone in taffeta .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 58]: With her lustreful light hair , absent blue eyes , and her gentle voice , as small and pretty as her face and figure , it was not too difficult to justify Crailey Gray 's characterization of her as one of those winsome baggages who had made an air of feminine helplessness the fashion of the day .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 26]: It is a wicked thing that some women should kiss when a man is by ; in the present instance the gentleman became somewhat faint .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 9]: `` I 'm so glad -- glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: exclaimed Betty .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 13]: `` You were just coming to see me , were n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 7]: My father is in the library .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 9]: Let me -- '' Miss Bareaud drew back .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 8]: she interrupted hastily and with evident perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 12]: `` I -- we must be on our way immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 29]: She threw a glance at the gentleman , which let him know that she now comprehended his gloves , and why their stroll had trended toward Carewe Street .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 6]: `` Come at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 9]: she commanded him quickly , in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 38]: `` But now that you 're here , '' said Miss Betty , wondering very much why he was not presented to her , `` wo n't you wait and let me gather a nosegay for you ?
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 27]: Our pansies and violets -- '' `` I could help , '' the gentleman suggested , with the look of a lame dog at Miss Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 11]: `` I have been considered useful about a garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 4]: `` Fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 38]: Betty did not hear the word that came from Miss Bareaud 's closed teeth , though she was mightily surprised at the visible agitation of her schoolmate , for the latter 's face was pale and excited .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 37]: And Miss Carewe 's amazement was complete when Fanchon , without more words , cavalierly seized the gentleman 's arm and moved toward the street with him as rapidly as his perceptible reluctance to leave permitted .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 37]: But at the gate Miss Bareaud turned and called back over her shoulder , as if remembering the necessity of offering an excuse for so remarkable a proceeding : `` I shall come again very soon .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 11]: Just now we are upon an errand of great importance .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 3]: Good-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 16]: Miss Betty waved her hand , staring after them , her eyes large with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 10]: She compressed her lips tightly : `` Errand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 19]: This was the friend of childhood 's happy hour , and they had not met in two years !
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 4]: `` Errand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 56]: She ran to the hedge , along the top of which a high white hat was now seen perambulating ; she pressed down a loose branch , and called in a tender voice to the stranger whom Fanchon had chosen should remain nameless : `` Be sure to put some salve on your hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 16]: He made a bow which just missed being too low , but did miss it .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 47]: `` It is there -- already , '' he said ; and , losing his courage after the bow , made his speech with so palpable a gasp before the last word that the dullest person in the world could have seen that he meant it .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 4]: Miss Betty disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 46]: There was a rigidity of expression about the gentle mouth of Fanchon Bareaud , which her companion did not enjoy , as they went on their way , each preserving an uneasy silence , until at her own door , she turned sharply upon him .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 25]: `` Tom Vanrevel , I thought you were the steadiest -- and now you 've proved yourself the craziest -- soul in Rouen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 4]: she burst out .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 9]: `` And I could n't say worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 11]: `` Why did n't you present me to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 3]: asked Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 23]: `` Because I thought a man of your gallantry might prefer not to face a shotgun in the presence of ladies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 4]: mimicked Miss Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 42]: `` You can ` pooh ' as much as you like , but if he had seen us from the window -- '' She covered her face with her hands for a moment , then dropped them and smiled upon him .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 30]: `` I understand perfectly to what I owe the pleasure of a stroll with you this morning , and your casual insistence on the shadiness of Carewe Street ! ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 19]: He laughed nervously , but her smile vanished , and she continued , `` Keep away , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 20]: She is beautiful , and at St. Mary 's I always thought she had spirit and wit , too .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 12]: I only hope Crailey wo n't see her before the wedding !
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 8]: But it is n't safe for you .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 17]: Go along , now , and ask Crailey please to come at three this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 18]: This message from Mr. Gray 's betrothed was not all the ill-starred Tom conveyed to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 32]: Mr. Vanrevel was ordinarily esteemed a person of great reserve and discretion ; nevertheless there was one man to whom he told everything , and from whom he had no secrets .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 55]: He spent the noon hour in feeble attempts to describe to Crailey Gray the outward appearance of Miss Elizabeth Carewe ; how she ran like a young Diana ; what one felt upon hearing her voice ; and he presented in himself an example exhibiting something of the cost of looking in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 16]: His conversation was more or less incoherent , but the effect of it was complete .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 3]: Chapter II .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 81]: Surviving Evils of the Reign of Terror Does there exist an incredulous , or jealous , denizen of another portion of our country who , knowing that the room in the wooden cupola over Mr. Carewe 's library was commonly alluded to by Rouen as the `` Tower Chamber , '' will prove himself so sectionally prejudiced as to deny that the town was a veritable hotbed of literary interest , or that Sir ` Walter Scott was ill-appreciated there ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 52]: Some of the men looked sly , and others grinned , at mention of this apartment ; but the romantic were not lacking who spoke of it in whispers : how the lights sometimes shone there all night long , and the gentlemen drove away , whitefaced , in the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 37]: The cupola , rising above the library , overlooked the garden ; and the house , save for that , was of a single story , with a low veranda running the length of its front .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 169]: The windows of the library and of a row of bedrooms -- one of which was Miss Betty 's -- lined the veranda , `` steamboat fashion ; '' the inner doors of these rooms all opening upon a long hail which bisected the house , the stairway leading to the room in the cupola rose the library itself , while the bisecting hail afforded be only access to the library ; hence , the gossips , ` eli acquainted with the geography of the place , conferred seriously together upon what effect Miss Betty 's homecoming would have in this connection : Dr anyone going to the stairway must needs pass her door ; and , what was more to the point , a party C gentlemen descending late from the mysterious garret might be not so quiet as they intended , and the young lady sufficiently disturbed to inquire of her father what entertainment he provided that should keep his guests until four in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 44]: But at present it was with the opposite end of the house that the town was occupied , for there , workmen were hammering and sawing and painting day long , finishing the addition Mr. Carewe was building for his daughter 's debut .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 21]: This hammering disturbed Miss Betty , who had become almost as busy with the French Revolution as with her mantua-maker .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 22]: For she had found in her father 's library many books not for convent-shelves ; and she had become a Girondin .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 54]: She found memoirs , histories , and tales of that delectable period , then not so dim with time but that the figures of it were more than tragic shadows ; and for a week there was no meal in that house to which she sat down earlier than half an hour Jate .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 58]: She had a rightful property-interest in the Revolution , her own great-uncle having been one of those who `` suffered ; '' not , however , under the guillotine ; for to Georges Meilhac appertained the rare distinction of death by accident on the day when the business-like young Bonaparte played upon the mob with his cannon .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 54]: There were some yellow letters of this great uncle 's in a box which had belonged to her grandmother , a rich discovery for Miss Betty , who read and re-read them with eager and excited eyes , living more in Paris with Georges and his friends than in Rouen with her father .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 9]: Indeed , she had little else to do .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 13]: Mr. Carewe was no comrade for her , by far the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 92]: She seldom saw him , except at the table , when he sat with averted eyes , and talked to her very little ; and , while making elaborate preparation for her introduction to his friends -LRB- such was his phrase -RRB- he treated her with a perfunctory civility which made her wonder if her advent was altogether welcome to him ; bat when she noticed that his hair looked darker than usual about every fourth day , she began to understand Why he appeared ungrateful to her for growing up .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 37]: He went out a great deal , though no visitors came to the house ; for it was known that Mr. Carewe desired to present his daughter to no one until he presented her to all .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 33]: Fanchon Bareaud , indeed , made one hurried and embarrassed call , evading Miss Betty 's reference to the chevalier of the kitten with a dexterity too nimble to be thought unintentional .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 62]: Miss Carewe was forbidden to return her friend 's visit until after her debut ; and Mr. Carewe explained that there was always some worthless Young men hanging about the Bareaud 's , where -LRB- he did not add -RRB- they interfered with a worthy oh one who desired to honor Fanchon 's older sister , Virginia , with his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 49]: This was no great hardship for Miss Betty , as , since plunging into the Revolution with her great-uncle , she had lost some curiosity concerning the men of to-day , doubting that they would show forth as heroic , as debonnair , gay and tragic as he .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 62]: He was the legendary hero of her childhood ; she remembered her mother 's stories of him perhaps more clearly than she remembered her mother ; and one of the older Sisters had known him in Paris and had talked of him at length , giving the flavor of his dandyism and his beauty at first hand to his young relative .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 69]: He had been one of those hardy young men wearing unbelievable garments , who began to appear in the garden of the Tuileries with knives in their sleeves and cudgels in their hands , about April , 1794 , and whose dash and recklessness in many matters were the first intimations that the Citizen Tallien was about to cause the Citizen Robespierre to shoot himself through the jaw .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 55]: In the library hung a small , full-length drawing of Georges , done in color by Miss Betty 's grandmother ; and this she carried to her own room an & studied long and ardently , until sometimes the man himself seemed to stand before her , in spite of the fact that Mile .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 17]: Meithac had not a distinguished talent and M. Meilhac 's features might have been anybody 's .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 13]: It was to be seen , however , that he was smiling .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 25]: Miss Betty had an impression that her grandmother 's art of portraiture would have been more-successful with the profile than the `` full-face . ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 31]: Nevertheless , nothing could be more clearly indicated than that the hair of M. Melihac was very yellow , and his short , huge-lapelled waistcoat white , striped with scarlet .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 70]: An enormous cravat covered his chin ; the heavy collar of his yellow coat rose behind his ears , while its tails fell to his ankles ; and the tight trousers of white and yellow stripes were tied with white ribbons about the middle of the calf ; he wore white stockings and gold-buckled yellow shoes , and on the back of his head a jauntily cocked black hat .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 102]: Miss Betty innocently wondered why his letters did not speak of Petion , of Vergniaud , or of Dumoriez , since in the historical novels which she read , the hero 's lot was inevitably linked with that of everyone of importance in his generation ; yet Georges appeared to have been unacquainted with these personages , Robespierre being the only name of consequence mentioned in his letters ; and then it appeared in much the same fashion practised by her father in alluding to the Governor of the State , who had the misfortune to be unpopular with Mr. Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 28]: But this did not dim her great-uncle 's lustre in Miss Betty 's eyes , nor lessen for her the pathetic romance of the smile he wore .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 84]: Beholding this smile , one remembered the end to which his light footsteps bad led him ; and it was unavoidable to picture him left lying in the empty street behind the heels of the flying crowd , carefully forming that same smile on his lips , and taking much pride in passing with some small , cynical speech , murmured to himself , concerning the futility of a gentleman 's getting shot by his friends for merely being present to applaud them .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 41]: So , fancying him thus , with his yellow hair , his scarlet-striped waistcoat , and his tragedy , the young girl felt a share of family greatness , or , at least , of picturesqueness , descend to her .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 21]: And she smiled sadly back upon the smile in the picture , and dreamed about its original night after night .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 44]: Whether or no another figure , that of a dark young man in a white hat , with a white kitten etching his wrist in red , found any place in her dreams at this period , -- it is impossible to determine .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 7]: She did not see him again .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 19]: It is quite another thing , hazardous to venture , to state that he did not see her .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 46]: At all events , it is certain that many people who bad never beheld her were talking of her ; that Rouen was full of contention concerning her beauty and her gift of music , for a song can be heard through an open window .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 45]: And how did it happen that Crailey Gray knew that it was Miss Carewe 's habit to stroll in her garden for half an hour or so , each evening before retiring , and that she went to mass every morning soon after sunrise ?
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 33]: Crailey Gray never rose at , or near , sunrise in his life , though he sometimes beheld it , from another point of view , as the end of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 9]: It appears that someone must have told him .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 81]: One night when the moon lay white on the trees and housetops , Miss Betty paused in her evening promenade and seated herself upon a bench on the borders of the garden , `` touched , '' as the books of the time would have put it , `` by the sweet tranquillity of the scene , '' and wrought upon by the tender incentive to sighs and melancholy which youth in loneliness finds in a loveliness of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 35]: The breeze bore the smells of the old-fashioned garden , of violets and cherry blossoms , and a sound of distant violins came on the air playing the new song from the new opera .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 95]: `` But I also dreamt , which pleased me most , That you loved me just the same -- '' they sang ; and with the lilt of them and the keen beauty of the night , the inherited pain of the ages rose from the depths of the young girl 's heart , so that she thought it must break ; for what reason she could not have told , since she was without care or sorrow that she knew , except the French Revolution , yet tears shone upon the long lashes .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 13]: She shook them off and looked up with a sudden odd consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 23]: The next second she sprang to her feet with a gasp and a choked outcry , her bands pressed to her breast .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 41]: Ten paces in front of her , a gap in the shrubbery where tall trees rose left a small radiant area of illumination like that of a lime-light in a theatre , its brilliancy intensified by the dark foliage behind .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 34]: It was open to view only from the bench by which she stood , and appeared , indeed , like the stage of a little theatre a stage occupied by a bizarre figure .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 48]: For , in the centre of this shining patch , with the light strong on his face , was standing a fair-haired young man , dressed in a yellow coat , a scarlet and white striped waistcoat , wearing a jauntily cocked black hat on his bead .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 29]: And even to the last detail , the ribbon laces above the ankle and the gold-buckled shoes , he was the sketch of Georges Meilhac sprung into life .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 75]: About this slender figure there hung a wan sweetness like a fine mist , almost an ethereality in that light ; yet in the pale face lurked something reckless , something of the actor , too ; and though his smile was gentle and wistful , there was a twinkle behind it , not seen at first , something amused and impish ; a small surprise underneath , like a flea in a rose-jar .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 28]: Fixed to the spot by this apparition , Miss Betty stood wildly staring , her straining eyelids showing the white above and below the large brown iris .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 24]: Her breath came faster and deeper , until , between her parted lips it became vocal in a quick sound like a sob .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 5]: At that he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 5]: `` Forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 55]: The voice was low , vibrant , and so exceedingly musical that he might have been accused of coolly selecting his best tone ; and it became only sweeter when , even more softly , in a semi-whisper of almost crucial pleading , he said , `` Ah -- do n't go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 39]: In truth , she could not go ; she had been too vitally stirred ; she began to tremble excessively , and sank back upon the bench , motioning him away with vague gestures of her shaking hands .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 16]: This was more than the Incroyable had counted upon , and far from his desires .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 7]: He started forward with an exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 8]: `` Do n't come near me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 5]: `` Who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 4]: Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 33]: `` Give me one second to explain , '' he began ; but with the instant reassurance of this beginning she cut him off short , her fears dispelled by his commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 19]: Nay , indignation displaced them so quickly that she fairly flashed up before him to her full height .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 11]: `` You did not come in by the gate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 20]: `` What do you mean by coming here in that dress What right have you in my garden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 14]: `` Just one word , '' he begged quickly , but very gently .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 10]: `` You 'd allow a street-beggar that much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 23]: She stood before him , panting , and , as he thought , glorious , in her flush of youth and anger .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 73]: Tom Vanrevel had painted her incoherently , but richly , in spite of that , his whole heart being in the portrait ; and -- Crailey Gray had smiled at what he deemed the exaggeration of an ordinarily unimpressionable man who had fallen in love `` at first sight ; '' yet , in the presence of the reality , the Incroyable decided that Tom 's colors had been gray and humble .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 136]: It was not that she was merely lovely , that her nose was straight , and her chin dexterously wrought between square and oval ; that her dark hair lay soft as a shadow on her white brow ; not that the trembling hand she held against her breast sprang from a taper wrist and tapered again to the tips of the long fingers ; nor that she was of that slenderness as strong as it is delicate ; not all the exquisite regularity of line and mould , nor simplicity of color , gave her that significance which made the Incroyable declare to himself that he stood for the first time in the presence of Beauty , and that now he knew the women he had been wont to call beautiful were but pretty .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 24]: And yet her beauty , he told himself , was the least of her loveliness , for there was a glamour about her .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 55]: It was not only the richness of her youth ; but there was an ineffable exhalation which seemed to be made partly of light , partly of the very spirit of her , and , oddly enough , partly of the scent of the little fan that hung by a ribbon from her waist .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 16]: This was a woman like a wine , he felt , there was a bouquet .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 91]: In regard to the bouquet of the young man himself , if he possessed one , it is pertinent to relate that at this very instant the thought skipped across his mind -LRB- like the hop of a flea in a rose-jar -RRB- that some day he might find the moment when he could tell her the truth about herself -- with a half-laugh -- and say : `` The angels sent their haloes in a sandal-wood box to be made into a woman -- and it was you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 15]: `` If you have anything to say for yourself , say it quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 4]: said Miss Betty .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 33]: `` You were singing a while ago , '' he answered , somewhat huskily , `` and I stopped on the street to listen ; then I came here to be nearer .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 16]: The spell of your voice -- '' He broke off abruptly to change the word .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 53]: `` The spell of the song came over me -- it is my dearest favorite -- so that I stood afterward in a sort of trance , only hearing again , in the silence , ` The stolen heart , like the gathered rose , will bloom but for a day ! '
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 12]: I did not see you until you came to the bench .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 18]: You must believe me : I would not have frightened you for anything in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 9]: `` Why are you wearing that dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 29]: He laughed , and pointed to where , behind him on the ground , lay a long gray cloak , upon which had been tossed a white mask .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 25]: `` I 'm on my way to the masquerade ; '' he answered , with an airy gesture in the direction of the violins .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 25]: `` I 'm an Incroyable , you see ; and I had the costume made from my recollection of a sketch of your great-uncle .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 12]: I saw it a long time ago in your library . ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 32]: Miss Carewe 's accustomed poise was quite recovered ; indeed , she was astonished to discover a distinct trace of disappointment that the brilliant apparition must offer so tame an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 47]: What he said was palpably the truth ; there was a masquerade that night , she knew , at the Madrillon 's , a little way up Carewe Street , and her father had gone , an hour earlier , a blue domino over his arm .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 20]: The Incroyable was a person of almost magical perceptiveness ; he felt the let-down immediately and feared a failure .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 17]: This would not do ; the attitude of tension between them must be renewed at once .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 7]: `` You 'll forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 9]: he began , in a quickly impassioned tone .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 55]: `` It was only after you sang , a dream possessed me , and -- '' `` I can not stay to talk with you , '' Miss Betty interrupted , and added , with a straightforwardness which made him afraid she would prove lamentably direct : `` I do not know you . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 34]: Perhaps she remembered that already one young man had been presented to her by no better sponsor than a white cat , and had no desire to carry her unconventionality farther than that .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 11]: In the present instance there was not even a kitten .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 44]: She turned toward the house , whereupon he gave a little pathetic exclamation of pleading in a voice that was masterly , being as sincere as it was musical , and he took a few leaning steps toward her , both hands outstretched .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: `` One moment more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 10]: he cried , as she turned again to him .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 21]: `` It may be the one chance of my life to speak with you ; do n't deny me this .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 33]: -- All the rest will meet you when the happy evening comes , will dance with you , talk with you , see you when they like , listen to you sing .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 25]: I , alone , must hover about the gates , or steal like a thief into your garden to hear you from a distance .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 13]: Listen to me -- just this once -- for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 16]: `` I can not listen , '' she said firmly ; and stood quite still .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 7]: She was now in deep shadow .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 8]: `` I will not believe you merciless !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: You would not condemn the meanest criminal unheard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 57]: Remembering that she was so lately from the convent , he ventured this speech in a deep , thrilling voice , only to receive a distinct shock for his pains , for she greeted it with an irrepressible , most unexpected peal of contralto laughter , and his lips parted slightly with the surprise of it .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 66]: They parted much farther in the next instant -- in good truth , it may be stated of the gentleman that he was left with his mouth open -- for , suddenly leaning toward him out of the shadow into the light , her face shining as a cast of tragedy , she cried in a hoarse whisper : `` Are you a murderer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 22]: And with that and a whisk of her skirts , and a footfall on the gravel path , she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 26]: He stood dumbfounded , poor comedian , having come to play the chief role , but to find the scene taken out of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 34]: Then catching the flutter of her wrap , as she disappeared into the darkness of the veranda , he cried in a loud , manly voice : `` You are a dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: As he came out into the street through a gap in the hedge , he paused , drawing his cloak about him , and lifted his face to the eastern moon .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 78]: It was a strange face : the modelling most like what is called `` Greek , '' save for the nose , which was a trifle too short for that , and the features showed a happy purity of outline almost childlike ; the blue eyes , clear , fleckless , serenely irresponsible , with more the look of refusing responsibility than being unconscious of it ; eyes without care , without prudence , and without evil .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 18]: A stranger might have said he was about twenty-five and had never a thought in his life .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 84]: There were some blossoms on the hedge , and he touched one lightly , as though he chucked it under the chin ; he smiled upon it then , but not as he had smiled upon Miss Betty , for this was his own , the smile that came when he was alone ; and , when it came , the face was no longer joyous as it had been in repose ; there was an infinite patience and worn tolerance-possibly for himself .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 29]: This incongruous and melancholy smile was astonishing : one looked for the laughter of a boy and found , instead , a gentle , worldly , old prelate .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 36]: Standing there , all alone in the moonlight , by the hedge , he lifted both hands high and waved them toward the house , as children wave to each other across lawns at twilight .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 16]: After that he made a fantastic bow to his corrugated shadow on the board sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 7]: `` Again , you rogue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 4]: he exclaimed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 32]: Then , as he faced about and began to walk in the direction of the beckoning violins : `` I wonder if Tom 's kitten was better , after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 65]: The Rogue 's Gallery of a Father Should be Exhibited to a Daughter with Particular Care Those angels appointed to be guardians of the merry people of Rouen , poising one night , between earth and stars , discovered a single brilliant and resonant spot , set in the midst of the dark , quiet town like a jewelled music-box on a black cloth .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 92]: Sounds of revelry and the dance from the luminous spot came up through the summer stillness to the weary guardians all night long , until , at last , when a red glow stole into the east , and the dance still continued , nay , grew faster than ever , the celestial watchers found the work too heavy for their strength , and forthwith departed , leaving the dancers to their own devices ; for , as everyone knows , when a dance lasts till daylight , guardian angels flee .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 93]: All night long the fiddles had been swinging away at their best ; all night long the candles had shone in thin rows of bright orange through the slits of the window-blinds ; but now , as the day broke over the maples , the shutters were flung open by laughing young men , and the drivers of the carriages , waiting in the dusty street , pressed up closer to the hedge , or came within and stretched themselves upon the lawn , to see the people waltzing in the daylight .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 60]: The horses , having no such desires , stood with loosened check-reins , slightly twitching their upper lips , wistful of the tall grass which bordered the wooden sidewalk , though now and then one would lift his head high , sniffing the morning air and bending an earnest gaze not upon the dancers but upon the florid east .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 113]: Over the unwearied plaint of French-horn , violin , and bassoon , rose a silvery confusion of voices and laughter and the sound of a hundred footfalls in unison , while , from the open windows there issued a warm breath , heavily laden with the smell of scented fans , of rich fabrics , of dying roses , to mingle with the spicy perfume of a wild crab-tree in fullest blossom , which stood near enough to peer into the ball-room , and , like a brocaded belle herself , challenge the richest to show raiment as fine , the loveliest to look as fair and joyful in the dawn . .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 110]: `` Believe me , of all those endearing young charms , Which I gaze on so fondly to-day , Were to fade by to-morrow and fleet from my arms , Like fairy gifts fading away -- '' So ran the violins in waltz time , so bassoon and horn to those dulcet measures ; and then , with one accord , a hundred voices joined them in the old , sweet melody : `` Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art , Let thy loveliness fade as it will ; And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart Would entwine itself verdantly still . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 105]: And the jealous crab-tree found but one to overmatch itself in beauty : a lady who was the focus of the singing ; for , by the time the shutters were flung open , there was not a young man in the room , lacked he never so greatly in music or in voice , who did not heartily desire to sing to Miss Betty Carewe , and who did not now -LRB- craning neck over partner 's shoulder -RRB- seek to fix her with his glittering eye , while he sang `` Oh , believe me '' most directly and conspicuously at her .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 63]: For that night was the beginning of Miss Betty 's famous career as the belle of Rouen , and was the date from which strangers were to hear of her as `` the beautiful Miss Carewe , '' until `` beautiful '' was left off , visitors to the town being supposed to have heard at least that much before they came .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 50]: There had been much discussion of her , though only one or two had caught glimpses of her ; but most of the gallants appeared to agree with Crailey Gray , who aired his opinion -- in an exceedingly casual way -- at the little club on Main Street .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 46]: Mr. Gray held that when the daughter of a man as rich as Bob Carewe was heralded as a beauty the chances were that she would prove disappointing , and , for his part , he was not even interested enough to attend and investigate .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 31]: So he was going down the river in a canoe and preferred the shyness of bass to that of a girl of eighteen just from the convent , he said .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 110]: Tom Vanrevel was not present on the occasion of these remarks ; and the general concurrence with Crailey may be suspected as a purely verbal one , since , when the evening came , two of the most enthusiastic dancers and love-makers of the town , the handsome Tappingham Marsh and that doughty ex-dragoon and Indian fighter , stout old General Trumble , were upon the field before the enemy appeared ; that is to say , they were in the new ball-room before their host ; indeed , the musicians had not arrived , and Nelson , an aged negro servitor , was engaged in lighting the house .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 54]: The crafty pair had planned this early descent with a view to monopoly by right of priority , in case the game proved worth the candle , and they were leaning effectively against the little railing about the musicians ' platform when Mr. Carewe entered the room with his daughter on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 38]: She was in white , touched with countless small lavender flowers ; there were rows and rows of wonderful silk and lace flounces on her skirt , and her fan hung from a rope of great pearls .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 25]: Ah , hideous , blue , rough cloth of the convent , unforgotten , but laid aside forever , what a chrysalis you were !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 49]: Tappingham twitched his companion 's sleeve , but the General was already posing ; and neither heard the words of presentation , because Miss Betty gave each of them a quick look , then smiled upon them as they bowed ; the slayers were prostrated before their prey .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 16]: Never were lady-killers more instantaneously tamed and subjugated by the power of the feminine eye .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 20]: Will Cummings came in soon , and , almost upon his heels , Eugene Madrillon and young Frank Chenoweth .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 53]: No others appeared for half an hour , and the five gentlemen looked at one another aside , each divining his own diplomacy in his fellow 's eye , and each laboriously explaining to the others his own mistake in regard to the hour designated upon Mr. Carewe 's cards of invitation .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 33]: This small embarrassment , however , did not prevent General Trumble and young Mr. Chenoweth from coming to high words over Miss Carewe 's little , gilt-filigree `` programme '' of dances .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 60]: It may be not untimely to remark , also , of these five redoubtable beaux , that , during the evening , it occurred to every one of them to be glad that Crailey Gray was betrothed to Fanchon Bareaud , and that he was down on the Rouen River with a canoe , a rod and a tent .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 30]: Nay , without more words , to declare the truth in regard to Crailey , they felt greater security in his absence from the field than in his betrothal .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 55]: As Mr. Chenoweth , a youth as open as out-of-doors , both in countenance and mind , observed plaintively to Tappingham Marsh in a corner , while they watched Miss Betty 's lavender flowers miraculously swirling through a quadrille : `` Crailey , you know , well , Crailey 's been engaged before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 22]: It was not Mr. Chenoweth 's habit to disguise his apprehensions , and Crailey Gray would not fish for bass forever .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 37]: The same Chenoweth was he , who , maddened by the General 's triumphantly familiar way of toying with Miss Betty 's fan between two dances , attempted to propose to her during the sunrise waltz .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 36]: Having sung `` Oh , believe me '' in her ear as loudly as he could , he expressed the wish -- quite as loudly -- `` That this waltz might last for always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 43]: That was the seventh time it had been said to Betty during the night , and though Mr. Chenoweth 's predecessors had revealed their desires in a guise lacking this prodigious artlessness , she already possessed no novel acquaintance with the exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 17]: But she made no comment ; her partner 's style was not a stimulant to repartee .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 34]: `` It would be heaven , '' he amplified earnestly , `` it would be heaven to dance with you forever -- on a desert isle where the others could n't come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 13]: he finished with sudden acerbity as his eye caught the General 's .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 46]: He proceeded , and only the cessation of the music aided Miss Carewe in stopping the declaration before it was altogether out ; and at that point Frank 's own father came to her rescue , though in a fashion little saving of her confusion .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 30]: The elder Chenoweth was one of the gallant and kindly Southern colony that made it natural for Rouen always to speak of Miss Carewe as `` Miss Betty '' .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 36]: He was a handsome old fellow , whose hair , long moustache and imperial were as white as he was proud of them , a Virginian with the admirable Southern fearlessness of being thought sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 37]: Mounting a chair with complete dignity , he lifted a glass of wine high in the air , and , when all the other glasses had been filled , proposed the health of his young hostess .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 48]: He made a speech of some length , pronouncing himself quite as hopelessly in love with his old friend 's daughter as all could see his own son was ; and wishing her long life and prosperity , with many allusions to fragrant bowers and the Muses .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 144]: It made Miss Betty happy , but it was rather trying , too , for she could only stand with downcast eyes before them all , trembling a little , and receiving a mixed impression of Mr. Chenoweth 's remarks , catching fragments here and there : `` And may the blush upon that gentle cheek , lovelier than the radiant clouds at set of sun , '' and `` Yet the sands of the hour-glass must fall , and in the calm and beauteous old age some day to be her lot , when fond mem ` ry leads her back to view again the brilliant scene about her now , where stand ` fair women and brave men , ' winecup in hand to do her honor , oh , may she wipe the silent tear '' , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 89]: As the old gentleman finished , and before the toast was drunk , Fanchon Bareaud , kissing her hand to Betty , took up the song again ; and they all joined in , lifting their glasses to the blushing and happy girl clinging to her father 's arm : `` Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art , Let thy loveliness fade as it will ; And around the dear ruin , each wish of my heart , Would entwine itself verdantly still . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 71]: They were happy people who had not learned to be self-conscious enough to fear doing a pretty thing openly without mocking themselves for it ; and it was a brave circle they made about Betty Carewe , the charming faces of the women and their fine furbelows , handsome men and tall , all so gay , so cheerily smiling , and yet so earnest in their welcome to her .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 35]: No one was afraid to `` let out '' his voice ; their song went full and strong over the waking town , and when it was finished the ball was over , too .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 37]: The veranda and the path to the gate became like tropic gardens , the fair colors of the women 's dresses , ballooning in the early breeze , making the place seem strewn with giant blossoms .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 33]: They all went away at the same time , those in carriages calling farewells to each other and to the little processions departing on foot in different directions to homes near by .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 28]: The sound of the voices and laughter drew away , slowly died out altogether , and the silence of the street was strange and unfamiliar to Betty .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 33]: She went to the hedge and watched the musicians , who were the last to go , until they passed from sight : little black toilsome figures , carrying grotesque black boxes .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 59]: While she could still see them , it seemed to her that her ball was not quite over , and she wished to hold the least speck of it as long as she could ; but when they had disappeared , she faced the truth with a deep sigh : the long , glorious night was finished indeed .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 33]: What she needed now was another girl : the two would have gone to Betty 's room and danced it all over again until noon ; but she had only her father .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 61]: She found him smoking a Principe cigar upon the veranda , so she seated herself timidly , nevertheless with a hopeful glance at him , on the steps at his feet ; and , as she did so , he looked down upon her with something more akin to geniality than anything she had ever seen in his eye before .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: It was not geniality itself , but might be third cousin to it .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 22]: Indeed , in his way , he was almost proud of her , though he had no wish to show it .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 25]: Since one was compelled to display the fact that one possessed a grown daughter , it was well that she be like this one .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 20]: They did not know each other very well , and she often doubted that they would ever become intimate .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 53]: There was no sense of companionship for either in the other ; she had been unable to break through his perfunctory , almost formal , manner with her ; therefore , because he encouraged no af-fection in her , she felt none , and wondered why , since he was her father .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 39]: She was more curious about him than interested , and , though she did not know it , she was prepared to judge him -- should occasion arise -- precisely as she would judge any other mere acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 68]: This morning , for the first time , she was conscious of a sense of warmth and gratitude toward him : the elaborate fashion in which he had introduced her to his friends made it appear possible that he liked her ; for he had forgotten nothing , and to remember everything in this case was to be lavish , which has often the appearance of generosity .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 42]: And yet there had been a lack : some small thing she had missed , though she was not entirely sure that she identified it ; but the lack had not been in her father or in anything he had done .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 71]: Then , too , there was something so unexpectedly human and pleasant in his not going to bed at once , but remaining to smoke on the veranda at this hour , that she gave him credit for a little of her own excitement , innocently fancying that he , also , might feel the need of a companion with whom to talk over the brilliant passages of the night .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 11]: And a moment ensued when she debated taking his hand .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 12]: She was too soon glad that her intuition forbade the demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 15]: `` It was all so beautiful , papa , '' she said , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 14]: `` I have no way to tell you how I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 45]: `` You may do that , '' he replied , evenly , with no unkindness , with no kindness , either , in the level of his tone , `` by never dancing again more than twice with one man in one evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 23]: `` I think I should much prefer not , myself , '' she returned , lifting her head to face him gravely .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 26]: `` I believe if I cared to dance more than once with one , I should like to dance all of them with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 4]: Mr. Carewe frowned .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 20]: `` I trust that you discovered none last night whom you wished to honor with your entire programme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 13]: `` No , '' she laughed , `` not last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 46]: Her father tossed away his cigar abruptly `` Is it too much to hope , '' he inquired , `` that when you discover a gentleman with whom you desire to waltz all night , you will omit to mention the fact to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 38]: There was a brief flash of her eye as she recalled her impulse to take his hand , but she immediately looked at him with such complete seriousness that he feared his irony had been thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 13]: `` I 'll remember not to mention it , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell him you told me not too . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 15]: `` I think you may retire now , '' said Mr. Carewe , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 17]: She rose from the steps , went to the door , then turned at the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 10]: `` Were all your friends here , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 19]: `` Do you think that every ninny who gabbled in my house last night was my friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 5]: he said , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 35]: `` There was one friend of mine , Mrs. Tanberry , who was n't here , because she is out of town ; but I do not imagine that you are inquiring about women .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: You mean : Was every unmarried male idiot who could afford a swallow-tailed coat and a clean pair of gloves cavorting about the place ?
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 25]: Yes , miss , they were all here except two , and one of those is a fool , the other a knave . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 9]: `` Ca n't I know the fool ? ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 5]: she asked , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 13]: `` I rejoice to find them so rare in your experience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 3]: he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 23]: `` This one is out of town , though I have no doubt you will see him sufficiently often when he returns .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 19]: His name is Crailey Gray , and he is to marry Fanchon Bareaud -- if he remembers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 6]: `` And the knave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 5]: `` Is one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 16]: Carewe shut his teeth with a venomous snap , and his whole face reddened suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 20]: `` I 'll mention this fellow once -- now , '' he said , speaking each word with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: `` His name is Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 75]: You see that gate ; you see the line of my property there : the man himself , as well as every other person in the town , remembers well that the last time I spoke to him , it was to tell him that if he ever set foot on ground of mine I 'd shoot him down , and he knows , and they all know , I shall keep my word !
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 18]: Elsewhere , I told him that for the sake of public peace , I should ignore him .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 26]: You will see him everywhere ; but it will not be difficult ; no one will have the hardihood to present him to my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 63]: The quarrel between us -- '' Mr. Carewe broke off for a moment , his hands clinching the arms of his chair , while he swallowed with difficulty , as though he choked upon some acrid bolus , and he was so strongly agitated by his own mention of his enemy that he controlled himself by a painful effort of his will .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 11]: `` The quarrel between us is political -- and personal .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 5]: You will remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 14]: `` I shall remember , '' she answered in a rather frightened voice .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 9]: ... It was long before she fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 23]: `` I alone must hover about the gates or steal into your garden like a thief , '' the Incroyable had said .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 31]: `` The last time I spoke to him it was to tell him that if he ever set foot on ground of mine , I 'd shoot him down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 7]: had been her father 's declaration .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 16]: And Mr. Carewe had spoken with the most undeniable air of meaning what he said .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 10]: Yet she knew that the Incroyable would come again .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 38]: Also , with hot cheeks pressed into her pillow , Miss Betty had identified the young man in the white hat , that dark person whose hand she had far too impetuously seized in both of hers .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 2]: Aha !
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 40]: It was this gentleman who looked into people 's eyes and stammered so sincerely over a pretty speech that you almost believed him , it was he who was to marry Fanchon Bareaud -- `` if he remembers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 20]: No wonder Fanchon had been in such a hurry to get him away ... `` If he remembers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 11]: Such was that young man 's character , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 28]: Miss Carewe laughed aloud to her pillow : for , was one to guess the reason , also , of his not having come to her ball ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 14]: Had the poor man been commanded to be `` out of town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 42]: Then , remembering the piquant and generous face of Fanchon , Betty clinched her fingers tightly and crushed the imp who had suggested the unworthy thought , crushed him to a wretched pulp and threw him out of the open window .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 27]: He immediately sneaked in by the back way , for , in spite of her victory , she still felt a little sorry for poor Fanchon .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 43]: `` But Spare Your Country 's Flag '' If it be true that love is the great incentive to the useless arts , the number of gentlemen who became poets for the sake of Miss Betty Carewe need not be considered extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 58]: Of all that was written of her dancing , Tom Vanrevel 's lines , `` I Danced with Her beneath the Lights '' -LRB- which he certainly had not done when he wrote them -RRB- were , perhaps , next to Crailey Gray 's in merit , though Tom burned his rhymes after reading them to Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 36]: Other troubadours were not so modest , and the Rouen Journal found no lack of tuneful offering , that spring , generously print-ing all of it , even at the period when it became epidemic .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 35]: The public had little difficulty in recognizing the work of Mr. Francis Chenoweth in an anonymous `` Sonnet '' -LRB- of twenty-three lines -RRB- which appeared in the issue following Miss Carewe 's debut .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 68]: Mr. Chenoweth wrote that while dancing the mazourka with a Lovely Being , the sweetest feelings of his soul , in a celestial stream , bore him away beyond control , in a seraphic dream ; and he untruthfully stated that at the same time he saw her wipe the silent tear , omitting , however , to venture any explanation of the cause of her emotion .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 10]: Old General Trumble boldly signed his poem in full .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 55]: It was called `` An Ode upon Miss C -- 's Waltzing , '' and it began : `` When Bettina found fair Rouen 's shore , And her aged father to us bore Her from the cloister neat , She waltzed upon the ball-room floor , And lightly twirled upon her feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 27]: Mr. Carewe was rightfully indignant , and refused to acknowledge the General 's salutation at their next meeting : Trumble was fifteen years older than he .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 63]: As Crailey Gray never danced with Miss Carewe , it is somewhat singular that she should have been the inspiration of his swinging verses in waltz measure , `` Heart-strings on a Violin , '' the sense of which was that when a violin had played for her dancing , the instrument should be shattered as wine-glasses are after a great toast .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 36]: However , no one , except the author himself , knew that Betty was the subject ; for Crailey certainly did not mention it to Miss Bareaud , nor to his best friend , Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 24]: It was to some degree a strange comradeship between these two young men ; their tastes led them so often in opposite directions .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 31]: They had rooms to-gether over their offices in the `` Madrillon Block '' on Main Street , and the lights shone late from their windows every night in the year .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 60]: Sometimes that would mean only that the two friends were talking , for they never reached a silent intimacy , but , even after several years of companionship , were rarely seen together when not in interested , often eager , conversation , so that people wondered what in the world they still found to say to each other .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 30]: But many a night the late-shining lamp meant that Tom sat alone , with a brief or a book , or wooed the long hours with his magical guitar .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 12]: For he never went to bed until the other came home .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 41]: And if daylight came without Crailey , Vanrevel would go out , yawning mightily , to look for him ; and when there was no finding him , Tom would come back , sleepless , to the day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 56]: Crailey was called `` peculiar '' and he explained , with a kind of jovial helplessness , that he was always prepared for the unexpected in himself , nor did such a view detract from his picturesqueness to his own perusal of himself ; though it was not only to himself that he was interesting .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 44]: To the vision of the lookers-on in Rouen , quiet souls who hovered along the walls at merry-makings and cheerfully counted themselves spectators at the play , Crailey Gray held the centre of the stage and was the chief comedian of the place .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 57]: Wit , poet , and scapegrace , the small society sometimes seemed the mere background set for his performances , spectacles which he , also , enjoyed , and from the best seat in the house ; for he was not content as the actor , but must be the Prince in the box as well .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 19]: His friendship for Tom Vanrevel was , in a measure , that of the vine for the oak .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 34]: He was full of levities at Tom 's expense , which the other bore with a grin of sympathetic comprehension , or , at long intervals , returned upon Crailey with devastating effect .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 35]: Vanrevel was the one steadying thing in his life , and , at the same time , the only one of the young men upon whom he did not have an almost mesmeric influence .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 16]: In good truth , Crailey was the ringleader in all the devilries of the town .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 54]: Many a youth swore to avoid the roisterer 's company for all time , and , within two hours of the vow , found himself , flagon in hand , engaged in a bout that would last the night , with Mr. Gray out-bumpering the hardiest , at the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 70]: And , the next morning , the fevered , scarlet-eyed perjurer might creep shaking to his wretched tasks , only to behold the cause of his folly and headache tripping merrily along the street , smiling , clean-shaven , and fresh as a dew-born primrose , with , perchance , two or three of the prettiest girls in town at his elbow to greet his sallies with approving laughter .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 54]: Crailey had been so long in the habit of following every impulse , no matter how mad , that he enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from condemnation , and , whatever his deeds , Rouen had learned to say , with a chuckle , that it was `` only Crailey Gray again . ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 8]: But his followers were not so privileged .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 125]: Thus , when Mr. Gray , who in his libations sometimes developed the humor of an urchin , went to the Pound at three in the morning of New Year 's Day , hung sleigh-bells about the necks of the cattle and drove them up and down the streets , himself hideously blowing a bass horn from the back of a big brown steer , those roused from slumber ceased to rage , and accepted the exploit as a rare joke , on learning that it was `` only Crailey Gray ; '' but the unfortunate young Chenoweth was heavily frowned upon and properly upbraided because he had followed in the wake of the bovine procession , mildly attempting to play upon a flageolet .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 10]: Crailey never denied a folly nor defended an escapade .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 56]: The latter was always done for him , because he talked of his `` graceless misdoings '' -LRB- so he was wont , smilingly , to call them -RRB- over cups of tea in the afternoons with old ladies , lamenting , in his musical voice , the lack of female relatives to guide him .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 67]: He was charmingly attentive to the elderly women , not from policy , but because his manner was uncontrollably chivalrous ; and , ever a gallant listener , were the speaker young , old , great or humble , he never forgot to catch the last words of a sentence , and seldom suffered for a reply , even when he had drowsed through a question .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 21]: Moreover , no one ever heard him speak a sullen word , nor saw him wear a brow of depression .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 45]: The single creed to which he was constant was that of good cheer ; he was the very apostle of gayety , preaching it in parlor and bar ; and made merry friends with battered tramps and homeless dogs in the streets at night .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 64]: Now and then he would spend several days in the offices of Gray & Vanrevel , Attorneys and Counsellors-at-Law , wearing an air of unassailable virtue ; though he did not far overstate the case when he said , `` Tom does all the work and gives me all the money not to bother him when he 's getting up a case . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 28]: The working member of the firm got up cases to notable effect , and few lawyers in the State enjoyed having Tom Vanrevel on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 57]: There was nothing about him of the floridity prevalent at that time ; he withered `` oratory '' before the court ; he was the foe of jury pathos ; and , despising noise and the habitual voice-dip at the end of a sentence , was , nevertheless , at times an almost fearfully effective orator .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 35]: So , by degrees the firm of Gray & Vanrevel , young as it was , and in spite of the idle apprentice , had grown to be the most prosperous in the district .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 12]: For this eminence Crailey was never accused of assuming the credit .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 18]: Nor did he ever miss an opportunity of making known how much he owed to his partner .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 10]: What he owed , in brief , was everything .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 19]: How well Vanrevel worked was demonstrated every day , but how hard he worked , only Crailey knew .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 35]: The latter had grown to depend upon him for even his political beliefs , and lightly followed his partner into Abolitionism ; though that was to risk unpopularity , bitter hatred , and worse .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 36]: Fortunately , on certain occasions , Vanrevel had made himself -LRB- if not his creed -RRB- respected , at least so far that there was no longer danger of mob-violence for an Abolitionist in Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 38]: He was a cool-headed young man ordinarily , and possessed of an elusive forcefulness not to be trifled with , though he was a quiet man , and had what they called a `` fine manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 74]: And , not in the latter , but in his dress , there was an echo of the Beau , which afforded Mr. Gray a point of attack for sallies of wit ; there was a touch of the dandy about Vanrevel ; he had a large and versatile wardrobe , and his clothes always fit him not only in line but in color ; even women saw how nobly they were fashioned .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 40]: These two young men were members of a cheerful band , who feasted , laughed , wrangled over politics , danced , made love , and sang terrible chords on summer evenings , together , as young men will .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 29]: Will Cummings , editor of the Rouen Journal , was one of these ; a tall , sallow man , very thin , very awkward and very gentle .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 54]: Mr. Cummings proved himself always ready with a loud and friendly laugh for the poorest joke in the world , his countenance shining with such kindness that no one ever had the heart to reproach him with the evils of his journalistic performances , or for the things he broke when he danced .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 42]: Another was Tappingham Marsh , an exceedingly handsome person , somewhat languid in appearance , dainty in manner with women , offhand with men ; almost as reckless as Crailey , and often the latter 's companion and assistant in dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 37]: Young Francis Chenoweth never failed to follow both into whatever they planned ; he was short and pink , and the uptilt of his nose was coherent with the appealing earnest-ness which was habitual with him .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 39]: Eugene Madrillon was the sixth of these intimates ; a dark man , whose Latin eyes and color advertised his French ancestry as plainly as his emotionless mouth and lack of gesture betrayed the mingling of another strain .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 46]: All these , and others of the town , were wont to `` talk politics '' a great deal at the little club on Main Street and all were apt to fall foul of Tom Vanrevel or Crailey Gray before the end of any discussion .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 121]: For those were the days when they twisted the Lion 's tail in vehement and bitter earnest ; when the eagle screamed in mixed figures ; when few men knew how to talk , and many orated ; when party strife was savagely personal ; when intolerance was called the `` pure fire of patriotism ; '' when criticism of the existing order of things surely incurred fiery anathema and black invective ; and brave was he , indeed , who dared to hint that his country , as a whole and politically , did lack some two or three particular virtues , and that the first step toward obtaining them would be to help it to realize their absence .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 21]: This latter point-of-view was that of the firm of Gray & Vanrevel , which was a unit in such matters .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 82]: Crailey did most of the talking -- quite beautifully , too -- and both had to stand against odds in many a sour argument , for they were not only Abolitionists , but opposed the attitude of their country in its difficulty with Mexico ; and , in common with other men of the time who took their stand , they had to grow accustomed to being called Disloyal Traitors , Foreign Toadies , Malignants , and Traducers of the Flag .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 37]: Tom had long been used to epithets of this sort , suffering their sting in quiet , and was glad when he could keep Crailey out of worse employment than standing firm for an unpopular belief .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 60]: There was one place to which Vanrevel , seeking his friend and partner , when the latter did not come home at night , could not go ; this was the Tower Chamber , and it was in that mysterious apartment of the Carewe cupola that Crailey was apt to be deeply occupied when he remained away until daylight .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 29]: Strange as it appears , Mr. Gray maintained peculiar relations of intimacy with Robert Carewe , in spite of the feud between Carewe and his own best friend .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 34]: This intimacy , which did not necessarily imply any mutual fondness -LRB- though Crailey seemed to dislike nobody -RRB- , was betokened by a furtive understanding , of a sort , between them .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 93]: They held brief , earnest conversations on the street , or in corners when they met at other people 's houses , always speaking in voices too low to be overheard ; and they exercised a mysterious symbolism , somewhat in the manner of fellow members of a secret society : they had been observed to communicate across crowded rooms , by lifted eyebrow , nod of head , or a surreptitious turn of the wrist : so that those who observed them knew that a question had been asked and answered .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 33]: It was noticed , also , that there were five other initiates to this masonry : Eugene Madrillon , the elder Chenoweth , General Trumble , Tappingham Marsh , and Jefferson Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 44]: Thus , on the afternoon following Miss Betty 's introduction to Rouen 's favorite sons and daughters , Mr. Carewe , driving down Main Street , held up one forefinger to Madrillon as he saw the young man turning in at the club .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 45]: Eugene nodded gravely , and , as he went in , discovering Marsh , the General , and others , listening to Mr. Gray 's explanation of his return from the river with no fish , stealthily held up one finger in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 16]: Trumble replied with a wink , Tappingham nodded , but Crailey slightly shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 12]: Marsh and the General started with surprise , and stared incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 7]: That Crailey should shake his head !
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 13]: If the signal had been for a church-meeting they might have understood .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 40]: Mr. Gray 's conduct was surprising two other people at about the same time : Tom Vanrevel and Fanchon Bareaud ; the former by his sudden devotion to the law ; the latter by her sudden devotion to herself .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 11]: In a breath , he became almost a domestic character .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 45]: No more did he spend his afternoons between the club and the Rouen House bar , nor was his bay mare so often seen stamping down the ground about Mrs. McDougal 's hitching-post while McDougal was out on the prairie with his engineering squad .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 54]: The idle apprentice was at his desk , and in the daytime he displayed an aversion for the streets , which was more than his partner did , for the industrious Tom , undergoing quite as remarkable an alteration of habit , became , all at once , little better than a corner-loafer .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 37]: His favorite lounging-place was a small drug-store where Carewe Street debouched upon Main ; nevertheless , so adhesive is a reputation once fastened , his air of being there upon business deceived everyone except Mr. Gray .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 28]: Miss Bareaud was even happier than she was astonished -LRB- and she was mightily astonished -RRB- to find her betrothed developing a taste for her society alone .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 34]: Formerly , she had counted upon the gayeties of her home to keep Crailey near her ; now , however , he told her tenderly he wished to have her all to himself .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 65]: This was not like him , but Fanchon did not question ; and it was very sweet to her that he began to make it his custom to come in by a side gate and meet her under an apple-tree in the dusk , where they would sit quietly together through the evening , listening to the noise and laughter from the lighted house .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 9]: That house was the most hospitable in Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 47]: Always cheerfully `` full of company , '' as they said , it was the sort of house where a carpet-dance could be arranged in half an hour ; a house with a sideboard like the widow 's cruse ; the young men always found more .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 33]: Mrs. Bareaud , a Southerner , loving to persuade the visitor that her home was his , not hers , lived only for her art , which was that of the table .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 41]: Evil cooks , taking service with her , became virtuous , dealt with nectar and ambrosia , and grew fit to pander to Olympus , learning of their mistress secrets to make the ill-disposed as genial gods ere they departed .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 33]: Mr. Bareaud at fifty had lived so well that he gave up walking , which did not trouble him ; but at sixty he gave up dancing , which did trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 22]: His only hope , he declared , was in Crailey Gray 's promise to invent for him : a concave partner .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 33]: There was a thin , quizzing shank of a son , Jefferson , who lived upon quinine , ague and deviltry ; and there were the two daughters , Fanchon and Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 55]: The latter was three years older than Fanchon , as dark as Fanchon was fair , though not nearly so pretty : a small , good-natured , romping sprite of a girl , who had handed down the heart and hand of Crailey Gray to her sister with the best grace in the world .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 37]: For she had been the heroine of one of Mr. Gray 's half-dozen or so most serious affairs , and , after a furious rivalry with Mr. Carewe , the victory was generally conceded to Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 88]: His triumph had been of about a fort-night 's duration when Fanchon returned from St. Mary 's ; and , with the advent of the younger sister , the elder , who had decided that Crailey was the incomparable she had dreamed of since infancy , was generously allowed to discover that he was not that vision -- that she had fallen in love with her own idea of him ; whereas Fanchon cared only that he be Crailey Gray , whatever kind of vision that was .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 11]: And Fanchon discovered that it was a great many kinds .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 57]: The transfer was made comfortably , with nice judgment of a respectable interregnum , and to the greater happiness of each of the three young people ; no objection ensuing from the easy-going parents , who were devotedly fond of Crailey , while the town laughed and said it was only that absurd Crailey Gray again .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 21]: He and Virginia were the best of friends , and accepted their new relation with a preposterous lack of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 27]: To be in love with Crailey became Fanchon 's vocation ; she spent all her time at it , and produced a blurred effect upon strangers .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 76]: The only man with whom she seemed quite alive was Vanrevel : a little because Tom talked of Crailey , and a great deal because she could talk of Crailey to Tom ; could tell him freely , as she could tell no one else , how wonderful Crailey was , and explain to him her lover 's vagaries on the ground that it was a necessity of geniuses to be unlike the less gifted .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 57]: Nor was she alone in suspecting Mr. Gray of genius : in the first place , he was so odd ; in the second , his poems were `` already attracting more than local attention , '' as the Journal remarked , generously , for Crailey had ceased to present his rhymes to that valuable paper .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 2]: Ay !
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 9]: Boston , no less , was his mart .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 57]: He was rather radical in his literary preferences , and hurt the elder Chenoweth 's feelings by laughing heartily at some poems of the late Lord Byron ; offended many people by disliking the style of Sir Edward Bulwer , and even refused to admit that James Fenimore Cooper was the greatest novelist that ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: But these things were as nothing compared with his unpatriotic defence of Charles Dickens .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 52]: Many Americans had fallen into a great rage over the vivacious assault upon the United States in `` Martin Chuzzlewit ; '' nevertheless , Crailey still boldly hailed him -LRB- as everyone had heretofore agreed -RRB- the most dexterous writer of his day and the most notable humorist of any day .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 37]: Of course the Englishman had not visited and thoroughly studied such a city as Rouen , Crailey confessed , twinklingly ; but , after all , was n't there some truth in `` Martin Chuzzlewit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 59]: Mr. Dickens might have been far from a clear understanding of our people ; but did n't it argue a pretty ticklish vanity in ourselves that we were so fiercely resentful of satire ; and was not this very heat over `` Martin Chuzzlewit '' a confirmation of one of the points the book had presented against us ?
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 57]: General Trumble replied to this suggestion with a personal one to the effect that a man capable of saying a good word for so monstrous a slander , that a man , sir , capable of declaring his native country to be vain or sensitive ought to be horsewhipped , and at this Crailey laughed consumedly .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 12]: Trumble retorted with the names of Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 52]: `` And if it comes to a war with these Greasers , '' he spluttered apoplectically , `` and it is coming , mighty soon , we 'll find Mr. Gray down in Mexico , throwing mud on the Stars and Stripes and cheering for that one-legged horse-thief , Santa Anna !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 12]: Anything to seek out something foolish amongst your own people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 42]: `` Do n't have to seek far , sometimes , General , '' murmured Crailey , from the depths of the best chair in the club , whereupon Trumble , not trusting himself to answer , went out to the street .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 50]: And yet , before that same evening was over , the General had shed honest tears of admiration and pity for Crailey Gray ; and Miss Betty saw her Incroyable again , for that night -LRB- the second after the Carewe dance -RRB- Rouen beheld the great warehouse tire .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 41]: CHAPTER V. Nero not the Last Violinist of his Kind Miss Carewe was at her desk , writing to Sister Cecilia , whom she most loved of all the world , when the bells startled her with their sudden clangor .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 36]: The quill dropped from her hand ; she started to her feet , wide-eyed , not understanding ; while the whole town , drowsing peacefully a moment ago , resounded immediately with a loud confusion .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 15]: She ran to the front door and looked out , her heart beating wildly .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 35]: The western sky was touched with a soft rose-color , which quickly became a warm glow , fluctuated , and , in the instant , shot up like the coming of a full Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 26]: Then through the broken foliage of the treetops could be seen the orange curls of flames , three-quarters of a mile away though they were .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 19]: People , calling loudly that `` it was Carewe 's warehouses , '' were running down the street .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 38]: From the stable , old Nelson , on her father 's best horse , came galloping , and seeing the white figure in the doorway , cried out in a quavering voice , without checking his steed .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 23]: `` I goin ' tell yo ' pa , Miss Betty , he in de kentry on lan ' bus ` ness .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 9]: Go back in de house , Missy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 44]: The other servants , like ragged sketches in the night , flitted by , with excited ejaculations , to join the runners , and Miss Betty followed them across the dew-strewn turf in her night slippers , but at the gate she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 36]: From up the street came the sound of a bell smaller than those of the churches and courthouse , yet one that outdid all others in the madness of its appeal to clear the way .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 58]: It was borne along by what seemed at first an indefinite black mass , but which -- as the Aurora grew keener , producing even here a faint , yellow twilight -- resolved itself into a mob of hoarsely-shouting men and boys , who were running and tugging at ropes , which drew along three extraordinary vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 55]: They came rapidly down the street and passed Miss Betty with a hubbub and din beyond all understanding ; one line of men , most of them in red shirts and oil-cloth helmets , at a dead run with the hose-cart ; a second line with the hand-engine ; the third dragging the ladder-wagon .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 35]: One man was riding , a tall , straight gentleman in evening clothes and without a hat , who stood precariously in the hose-cart , calling in an annoyed tone through a brazen trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 62]: Miss Betty recognized him at once ; it was he who caught her kitten ; and she thought that if she had been Fanchon Bareaud she must have screamed a warning , for his balance appeared a thing of mere luck , and , if he fell , he would be trampled under foot and probably run over by the engine .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 14]: But , happily -LRB- she remembered -RRB- , she was not Fanchon Bareaud !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 52]: Before , behind , and beside the Department , raced a throng of boys , wild with the joy experienced by their species when property is being handsomely destroyed ; after them came panting women , holding their sides and gasping with the effort to keep up with the flying procession .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 41]: Miss Betty trembled , for she had never seen the like in her life ; she stood close to the hedge and let them go by ; then she turned in after them and ran like a fleet young deer .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: She was going to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 115]: Over all the uproar could be heard the angry voice through the trumpet , calling the turns of the streets to the men in the van , upbraiding them and those of the other two companies impartially ; and few of his hearers denied the chief his right to express some chagrin ; since the Department -LRB- organized a half-year , hard-drilled , and this its first fire worth the name -RRB- was late on account of the refusal of the members to move until they had donned their new uniforms ; for the uniforms had arrived from Philadelphia two months ago , and tonight offered the first opportunity to display them in public .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 5]: `` Hail Vanrevel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 27]: panted Tappingham Marsh to Eugene Madrillon , as the two , running in the van of the `` Hose Company , '' splattered through a mud-puddle .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 18]: `` You 'd think he was Carewe 's only son and heir instead of his worst enemy .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 6]: Hark to the man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 17]: `` I 'd let it burn , if I were he , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 25]: `` It was all Crailey 's fault , '' said Tappingham , swinging an arm free to wipe the spattered mud from his face .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 23]: `` He swore he would n't budge without his uniform , and the rest only backed him up ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 23]: Crailey said Carewe could better afford to lose his shanties than the overworked Department its first chance to look beautiful and earnest .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 19]: Tom asked him why he did n't send for a fiddle , '' Marsh finished with a chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 36]: `` Carewe might afford to lose a little , even a warehouse or two , if only out of what he 's taken from Crailey and the rest of us , these three years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 8]: `` Taken from Vanrevel , you mean .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 20]: Who does n't know where Crailey 's -- Here 's Main Street ; look out for the turn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 26]: They swung out of the thick shadows of Carewe Street into full view of the fire , and their faces were illuminated as by sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 24]: The warehouses stood on the river-bank , at the foot of the street , just south of the new `` covered bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 255]: There were four of them , huge , bare-sided buildings ; the two nearer the bridge of brick , the others of wood , and all of them rich with stores of every kind of river-merchandise and costly freight : furniture that had voyaged from New England down the long coast , across the Mexican Gulf , through the flat Delta , and had made the winding journey up the great river a thousand miles , and almost a thousand more , following the greater and lesser tributaries ; cloth from Connecticut that had been sold in Philadelphia , then carried over mountains and through forests by steam , by canal , by stage , and six-mule freight-wagons , to Pittsburg , down the Ohio , and thence up to Rouen on the packet ; Tennessee cotton , on its way to Massachusetts and Rhode Island spindles , lay there beside huge mounds of raw wool from Illinois , ready to be fed to the Rouen mill ; dates and nuts from the Caribbean Sea ; lemons from groves of the faraway tropics ; cigars from the Antilles ; tobacco from Virginia and Kentucky ; most precious of all , the great granary of the farmers ' wheat from the level fields at home ; and all the rich stores and the houses that held them , as well as the wharves upon which they had been landed , and the steamers that brought them up the Rouen River , belonged to Robert Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 45]: That it was her father 's property which was imperilled attested to the justification of Miss Betty in running to a fire ; and , as she followed the crowd into Main Street , she felt a not unpleasant proprietary interest in the spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 34]: Very opposite sensations animated the breast of the man with the trumpet , who was more acutely conscious than any other that these were Robert Carewe 's possessions which were burning so handsomely .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 35]: Nor was he the only one among the firemen who ground his teeth over the folly of the uniforms ; for now they could plainly see the ruin being wrought , the devastation threatened .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 53]: The two upper stories of the southernmost warehouse had swathed themselves in one great flame ; the building next on the north , also of frame , was smoking heavily ; and there was a wind from the southwest , which , continuing with the fire unchecked , threatened the town itself .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 10]: There was work for the Volunteer Brigade that night .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 57]: They came down Main Street with a rush , the figure of their chief swaying over them on his high perch , while their shouting was drowned in the louder roar of greeting from the crowd , into which they plunged as a diver into the water , swirls and eddies of people marking the wake .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 22]: A moment later a section of the roof of the burning warehouse fell in , with a sonorous and reverberating crash .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 55]: The `` Engine Company '' ran the force-pump out to the end of one of the lower wharves ; two lines of pipe were attached ; two rows of men mounted the planks for the pumpers , and , at the word of command , began the up-and-down of the hand-machine with admirable vim .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 18]: Nothing happened ; the water did not come ; something appeared to be wrong with the mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 54]: As everyone felt the crucial need of haste , nothing could have been more natural than that all the members of the `` Engine Company '' should simultaneously endeavor to repair the defect ; therefore ensued upon the spot a species of riot which put the engine out of its sphere of usefulness .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 116]: In the meantime , fifty or sixty men and boys who ran with the machines , but who had no place in their operation , being the Bucket Brigade , had formed a line and were throwing large pails of water in the general direction of the southernmost warehouse , which it was now impossible to save ; while the gentlemen of the `` Hook-and-Ladder Company , '' abandoning their wagons , and armed with axes , heroically assaulted the big door of the granary , the second building , whence they were driven by the exasperated chief , who informed them that the only way to save the wheat was to save the building .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 44]: Crailey Gray , one of the berated axemen , remained by the shattered door after the others had gone , and , struck by a sudden thought , set his hand upon the iron latch and opened the door by this simple process .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 5]: It was not locked .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 14]: Crailey leaned against the casement and laughed with his whole soul and body .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 69]: Meanwhile , by dint of shouting in men 's ears when near them , through the trumpet when distant , tearing axes from their hands , imperiously gesticulating to subordinate commanders , and lingering in no one spot for more than a second , Mr. Vanrevel reduced his forces to a semblance of order in a remarkably short time , considering the confusion into which they had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 55]: The space between the burning warehouse and that next it was not more than fifty feet in width , but fifty feet so hot no one took thought of entering there ; an area as discomfiting in appearance as it was beautiful with the thick rain of sparks and firebrands that fell upon it .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 32]: But the chief had decided that this space must be occupied , and more : must be held , since it was the only point of defence for the second warehouse .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 52]: The roof of this building would burn , which would mean the destruction of the warehouse , unless it could be mounted , because the streams of water could not play upon it from the ground , nor , from the ladders , do much more than wet the projecting eaves .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 30]: It was a gable roof , the eaves twenty feet lower on the south side than on the north , where the ladders could not hope to reach them .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 21]: Vanrevel swung his line of bucketeers round to throw water , not upon the flames , but upon the ladder-men .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 15]: Miss Carewe stood in the crowd upon the opposite side of the broad street .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 30]: Even there her cheeks were uncomfortably hot , and sometimes she had to brush a spark from her shoulder , though she was too much excited to mind this .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 51]: She was watching the beautiful fiery furnace between the north wall of the burning warehouse and the south wall of its neighbor , the fifty feet brilliant and misty with vaporous rose-color , dotted with the myriad red stars , her eyes shining with the reflection of their fierce beauty .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 75]: She saw how the vapors moved there , like men walking in fire , and she was vaguely recalling Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , when , over the silhouetted heads of the crowd before her , a long black ladder rose , wobbled , tilted crazily , then lamely advanced and ranged itself against the south wall of the second warehouse , its top rung striking ten feet short of the eaves .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 13]: She hoped that no one had any notion of mounting that ladder .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 59]: A figure appeared upon it immediately , that of a gentleman , bareheaded and in evening dress , with a brass trumpet swinging from a cord about his shoulders ; the noise grew less ; the shouting died away , and the crowd became almost silent , as the figure , climbing slowly drew up above their heads .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 17]: Two or three rungs beneath , came a second -- a man in helmet and uniform .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 17]: The clothes of both men , drenched by the bucketeers , clung to them , steaming .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 35]: As the second figure mounted , a third appeared ; but this was the last , for the ladder was frail , and sagged toward the smoking wall with the weight of the three .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 39]: The chief , three-fourths of the way to the top , shouted down a stifled command , and a short grappling-ladder , fitted at one end with a pair of spiked iron hooks , was passed to him .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 58]: Then he toiled upward until his feet rested on the third rung from the top ; here he turned , setting his back to the wall , lifted the grappling-ladder high over his head so that it rested against the eaves above him , and brought it down sharply , fastening the spiked hooks in the roof .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 34]: As the eaves projected fully three feet , this left the grappling-ladder hanging that distance out from the wall , its lowest rung a little above the level of the chief 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 12]: Miss Betty drew in her breath with a little choked cry .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 73]: There was a small terraced hill of piled-up packing-boxes near her , possession of which had been taken by a company of raggamuffinish boys , and she found herself standing on the highest box and sharing the summit with these questionable youths , almost without noting her action in mounting thither , so strained was the concentration of her attention upon the figure high up in the rose-glow against the warehouse wall .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 24]: The man , surely , surely , was not going to trust himself to that bit of wooden web hanging from the roof !
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 9]: Where was Miss Bareaud that she permitted it ?
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 41]: Ah , if Betty had been Fanchon and madwoman enough to have accepted this madman , she would have compelled him to come down at once , and thereafter would lock him up in the house whenever the bells rang !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 14]: But the roof was to be mounted or Robert Carewe 's property lost .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 22]: Already little flames were dancing up from the shingles , where firebrands had fallen , their number increasing with each second .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 36]: So Vanrevel raised his arms , took a hard grip upon the lowest rung of the grappling-ladder and tried it with his weight ; the iron hooks bit deeper into the roof ; they held .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 87]: He swung himself out into the air with nothing beneath him , caught the rung under his knee , and for a moment hung there while the crowd withheld from breathing ; then a cloud of smoke , swirling that way , made him the mere ghostly nucleus of himself , blotted him out altogether , and , as it rose slowly upward , showed the ladder free and empty , so that at first there was an instant when they thought that he had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 16]: But , as the smoke cleared , there was the tall figure on the roof .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 20]: It was an agile and daring thing to do , and the man who did it was mightily applauded .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 67]: The cheering bothered him , however , for he was trying to make them understand , below , what would happen to the `` Engine Company '' in case the water was not sent through the lines directly ; and what he said should be done to the engineers included things that would have blanched the cheek of the most inventive Spanish Inquisitor that ever lived .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 14]: Miss Betty made a gesture as if to a person within whispering distance .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 44]: `` Your coat is on fire , '' she said in an ordinary conversational tone , without knowing she had spoken aloud , and Mr. Vanrevel , more than one hundred feet away , seemed particularly conscious of the pertinence of her remark .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 53]: He removed the garment with alacrity , and , for the lack of the tardy water , began to use it as a flail upon the firebrands and little flames about him ; the sheer desperate best of a man in a rage , doing what he could when others failed him .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 77]: Showers of sparks fell upon him ; the smoke was rising everywhere from the roof and the walls below ; and , growing denser and denser , shrouded him in heavy veils , so that , as he ran hither and thither , now visible , now unseen , stamping and beating and sweeping away the brands that fell , he seemed but the red and ghostly caricature of a Xerxes , ineffectually lashing the sea .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 18]: They were calling to him imploringly to come down , in heaven 's name to come down !
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 58]: The second man had followed to the top of the ladder against the wall , and there he paused , waiting to pass up the line of hose when the word should come that the force-pump had been repaired ; but the people thought that he waited because he was afraid to trust himself to the grappling-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 27]: He was afraid , exceedingly afraid ; though that was not why he waited ; and he was still chuckling over the assault of the axes .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 56]: His situation had not much the advantage of that of the chief : his red shirt might have been set with orange jewels , so studded it was with the flying sparks ; and , a large brand dropping upon his helmet , he threw up his hand to dislodge it and lost the helmet .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 26]: The great light fell upon his fair hair and smiling face , and it was then that Miss Betty recognized the Incroyable of her garden .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 59]: The Ever Unpractical Feminine It was an investigating negro child of tender years , who , possessed of a petty sense of cause and effect , brought an illuminative simplicity to bear upon the problem of the force-pump ; and a multitudinous agitation greeted his discovery that the engineers had forgotten to connect their pipes with the river .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 55]: This naive omission was fatal to the second warehouse ; the wall burst into flame below Crailey Gray , who clung to the top of the ladder , choking , stifled , and dizzily fighting the sparks that covered him , yet still clutching the nozzle of the hose-line they had passed to him .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 43]: When the stream at last leaped forth , making the nozzle fight in his grasp , he sent it straight up into the air and let the cataract fall back upon himself and upon the two men beneath him on the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 39]: There came a moment of blessed relief ; and he looked out over the broad rosy blur of faces in the street , where no one wondered more than he how the water was to reach the roof .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 22]: Suddenly he started , wiped his eyes with his wet sleeve , and peered intently down from under the shading arm .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 64]: His roving glance crossed the smoke and flame to rest upon a tall , white figure that stood , full-length above the heads of the people , upon a pedestal wrought with the grotesque images of boys : a girl 's figure , still as noon , enrapt , like the statue of some young goddess for whom were made these sacrificial pyres .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 6]: Mr. Gray recognized his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 39]: A blackened and unrecognizable face peered down from the eaves , and the voice belonging to it said , angrily : `` Why did n't they send up that line before they put the water through it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 19]: `` Never mind , Tom , '' answered Crailey cheerfully , `` I 'll bring it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: `` You ca n't ; I 'll come down for it .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 10]: Do n't be every kind of a fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: `` You want a monopoly , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 66]: And Crailey , calling to Tappingham Marsh , next below him , to come higher , left the writhing nozzle in the latter 's possession , swung himself out upon the grappling-ladder , imitating the chief 's gymnastics , and immediately , one hand grasping the second rung , one knee crooked over the lowest , leaned head down and took the nozzle from Marsh .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 42]: It was a heavy weight , and though Marsh supported the line beneath it , the great stream hurtling forth made it a difficult thing to manage , for it wriggled , recoiled and struggled as if it had been alive .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 49]: Crailey made three attempts to draw himself up ; but the strain was too much for his grip , and on the third attempt his fingers melted from the rung , and he swung down fearfully , hanging by his knee , but still clinging to the nozzle .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 30]: `` Give it up , Crailey ; it is n't worth it , '' Vanrevel called from overhead , not daring the weight of both on the light grappling-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 55]: But though Crailey cared no more for the saving of Robert Carewe 's property than for a butterfly 's wing in China , he could not give up now , any more than as a lad he could have forborne to turn somersaults when the prettiest little girl looked out of the school-house window .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 75]: He passed the nozzle to Tappingham , caught the second rung with his left hand , and , once more hanging head downward , seized the nozzle ; then , with his knee hooked tight , as the gushing water described a huge semicircle upon the smoke and hot vapor , he made a mad lurch through the air , while women shrieked ; but he landed upright , half-sitting on the lowest rung .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 47]: He climbed the grappling-ladder swiftly , in spite of the weight and contortions of the unmanageable beast he carried with him ; Tom leaned far down and took it from him ; and Crailey , passing the eaves , fell , exhausted , upon the roof .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 21]: Just as he reached this temporary security , a lady was borne , fainting , out of the acclaiming crowd .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: Fanchon was there .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 54]: Word had been passed to the gentlemen of the `` Engine Company '' to shut off the water in order to allow the line to be carried up the ladder , and they received the command at the moment Tom lifted the nozzle , so that the stream dried up in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 28]: This was the last straw , and the blackened , singed and scarred chief , setting the trumpet to his lips , gave himself entirely to wrath .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 28]: It struck Crailey , even as he lay , coughing and weeping with smoke , that there was something splendid and large in the other 's rage .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 96]: Vanrevel was ordinarily so steady and cool that this was worth seeing , this berserker gesture ; worth hearing , this wonderful profanity , like Washington 's one fit of cursing ; and Crailey , knowing Tom , knew , too , that it had not come upon him because Carewe had a daughter into whose eyes Tom had looked ; nor did he rage because he believed that Crailey 's life and his were in the greater hazard for the lack of every drop of water that should have issued from the empty nozzle .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 106]: Their lungs were burdened with smoke , while the intolerable smarting of throat , eyes , and nostrils was like the incision of a thousand needles in the membranes ; their clothes were luminous with glowing circles where the sparks were eating ; the blaze widened on the wall beneath them , and Marsh was shouting hoarsely that he could no longer hold his position on the ladder ; yet Crailey knew that none of this was in Tom 's mind as he stood , scorched , blistered , and haggard , on the edge of the roof , shaking his fist at the world .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 18]: It was because his chance of saving the property of a man he despised was being endangered .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 12]: Crailey stretched forth a hand and touched his friend 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 17]: `` Your side of the conversation is a trifle loud , Tom , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 18]: `` Miss Carewe is down there , across the street , on a pile of boxes . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 25]: Tom stopped in the middle of a word , for which he may have received but half a black stroke from the recording angel .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 23]: He wheeled toward the street , and , shielding his inflamed eyes with his hand , gazed downward in a stricken silence .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 25]: From that moment Mr. Vanrevel 's instructions to his followers were of a decorum at which not the meekest Sunday-school scholar dare have cavilled .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 45]: The three men now on the long ladder , Marsh , Eugene Madrillon , and Will Cummings , found their position untenable ; for the flames , reaching all along the wall , were licking at the ladder itself , between Marsh and Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 27]: `` I ca n't stand this any longer , '' gasped Tappingham , `` but I ca n't leave those two up there , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 11]: `` Not alone , '' shouted Cummings from beneath Madrillon .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 7]: `` Let 's go up . ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 79]: Thus it happened , that when the water came again , and Vanrevel let it fall in a grateful cascade upon Crailey and himself , three manly voices were heard singing , as three men toiled through the billows of rosy gray , below the beleaguered pair : `` Oh the noble Duke of York , He had Ten thousand men ; He marched them up the side of a house , And marched them down again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 29]: A head appeared above the eaves , and Marsh , then Eugene , then Cummings , came crawling over the cornice in turn , to join their comrades .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 41]: They were a gallant band , those young gentlemen of Rouen , and they came with the ironical song on their lips , and , looking at one another , ragged and scarified , burst into hoarse but indomitable laughter .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 14]: Two others made an attempt to follow , and would not be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 72]: It was noticed that parts of the lower ladder had been charring ; and the ladder-men were preparing to remove it to a less dangerous point , when old General Trumble and young Jefferson Bareaud made a rush to mount it , and were well upon their upward way before the ladder , weakened at the middle , sagged , splintered , and broke , Trumble and Bareaud falling with it .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 22]: And there was the grappling-ladder , dangling forty feet above the ground ; and there were the five upon the roof .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 17]: The Department had no other ladder of more than half the length of the shattered one .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 32]: Not only the Department , but every soul in Rouen , knew that ; and there rose the thick , low sigh of a multitude , a sound frightful to hear .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 16]: It became a groan , then swelled into a deep cry of alarm and lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 62]: And now , almost simultaneously , the west wall of the building , and the south wall , and all the southwestern portions of the roof , covered them-selves with voluminous mantles of flame , which increased so hugely and with such savage rapidity that the one stream on the roof was seen to be but a ridiculous and useless opposition .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 16]: Everybody began to shout advice to his neighbor ; and nobody listened even to himself .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 19]: The firemen were in as great a turmoil as was the crowd , while women covered their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 30]: Young Frank Chenoweth was sobbing curses upon the bruised and shaking Trumble and Jefferson Bareaud , who could only stand remorseful , impotently groaning , and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 53]: The walls of the southernmost warehouse followed the roof , crashing inward one after the other , a sacrificial pyre with its purpose consummated ; and in the seeth and flare of its passing , Tom Vanrevel again shaded his eyes with his hand , and looked down across the upturned faces .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 23]: The pedestal with the grotesque carvings was still there ; but the crowning figure had disappeared -- the young goddess was gone .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 58]: For she , of all that throng , had an idea in her head , and , after screaming it to every man within reach , only to discover the impossibility of making herself understood in that Babel , she was struggling to make her way toward the second warehouse , through the swaying jam of people .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 39]: It was a difficult task , as the farther in she managed to go , the denser became the press and the more tightly she found the people wedged , until she received involuntary aid from the firemen .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 40]: In turning their second stream to play ineffectually upon the lower strata of flame , they accidentally deflected it toward the crowd , who separated wildly , leaving a big gap , of which Miss Betty took instant advantage .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 24]: She darted across , and the next moment , unnoticed , had entered the building through the door which Crailey Gray had opened .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 74]: The five young men on the roof were well aware that there was little to do but to wait , and soon they would see which was to win , they or the fire ; so they shifted their line of hose to the eastern front of the building -- out of harm 's way , for a little time , at least -- and held the muzzle steady , watching its work .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 14]: And in truth it was not long before they understood which would conquer .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 56]: The southern and western portions of the building had flung out great flames that fluttered and flared on the breeze like Titanic flags ; and steadily , slowly , at first , then faster as the seconds flew , the five were driven backward , up the low slope of the roof toward the gable-ridge .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 26]: Tom Vanrevel held the first joint of the nozzle , and he retreated with a sulky face , lifting his foot grudgingly at each step .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 30]: They were all silent , now , and no one spoke until Will Cummings faltered : `` Surely they 'll get a rope up to us some way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 27]: Will knew as well as did the others that there was no way ; but his speech struck the sullen heart of the chief with remorse .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 3]: He turned .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 15]: `` I hope you 'll all forgive me for getting you up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 53]: A sound , half sob , half giggle , came from the parched lips of Eugene Madrillon , as he patted Tom on the shoulder without speaking , and Crailey nodded quietly , then left the group and went to the eastern edge of the roof and looked out upon the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 55]: Cummings dropped the line and sat down , burying his hot face in his arms , for they all saw that Vanrevel thought `` it was no use , '' but a question of a few minutes , and they would retreat across the gable and either jump or go down with the roof .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 47]: Since the world began , idle and industrious philosophers have speculated much upon the thoughts of men about to die ; yet it can not be too ingenuous to believe that such thoughts vary as the men , their characters , and conditions of life vary .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 66]: Nevertheless , pursuant with the traditions of minstrelsy and romance , it is conceivable that young , unmarried men , called upon to face desperate situations , might , at the crucial moment , rush to a common experience of summoning the vision , each of his heart 's desire , and to meet , each his doom , with her name upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 46]: An extraordinary thing occurred in the present instance , for , by means of some fragmentary remarks let fall at the time , and afterward recalled such as Tappingham Marsh 's gasping : `` At least it will be on her father 's roof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 55]: and from other things later overheard , an inevitable deduction has been reached that four of the five gentlemen in the perilous case herein described were occupied with the vision of the same person , to wit : Miss Elizabeth Carewe , `` the last -- the prettiest -- to come to town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 29]: Crailey Gray , alone , spoke not at all ; but why did he strain and strain his eyes toward that empty ' pedestal with the grotesque carvings ?
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 26]: Did he seek Fanchon there , or was Miss Carewe the last sweet apparition in the fancies of all five of the unhappy young men ?
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 51]: The coincidence of the actual appearance of the lady among them , therefore seemed the more miraculous , when , wan and hopeless , staggering desperately backward to the gable-ridge , they heard a clear contralto voice behind them : `` Had n't you better all come down now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 3]: it said .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 12]: -- `` The stairway will be on fire before long . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 37]: Only one thing could have been more shockingly unexpected to the five than that there should be a sixth person on the roof , and this was that the sixth person should be Miss Betty Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 16]: They turned , aghast , agape , chopfallen with astonishment , stunned , and incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 43]: She stood just behind the gable-ridge , smiling amiably , a most incongruous little pink fan in her hand , the smoke-wreaths partly obscuring her and curling between the five and her white dress , like mists floating across the new moon .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 10]: Was it but a kindly phantasm of the brain ?
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 13]: Was it the incarnation of the last vision of the lost Volunteers ?
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 31]: Was it a Valkyrie assuming that lovely likeness to perch upon this eyrie , waiting to bear their heroic souls to Valhalla , or -- was it Miss Betty Carewe ?
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 44]: To the chief she spoke -- all of them agreed to that afterward -- but it was Crailey who answered , while Tom could only stare , and stand wagging his head at the lovely phantom , like a Mandarin on a shelf .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: `` My mother in heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 3]: gasped Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 9]: `` How did you come up here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 31]: `` There 's a trap in the roof on the other side of the ridge , '' she said , and she began to fan herself with the pink fan .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 27]: `` A stairway runs all the way down -- old Nelson showed me through these buildings yesterday -- and that side is n't on fire yet .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 26]: I 'm so sorry I did n't think of it until a moment ago , because you could have brought the water up that way .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 13]: But do n't you think you 'd better come down now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 44]: The Comedian Not savage Hun , nor `` barbarous Vandyke , '' nor demon Apache , could wish to dwell upon the state of mind of the Chief of the Rouen Volunteer Fire Department ; therefore , let the curtain of mercy descend .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 32]: Without a word , he turned and dragged the nozzle to the eastern eaves , whence , after a warning gesture to those below , he dropped it to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 22]: And , out of compassion , it should be little more than hinted that the gesture of warning was very slight .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 90]: When the rescued band reached the foot of the last flight of stairs , they beheld the open doorway as a frame for a great press of intent and con-torted faces , every eye still strained to watch the roof ; none of the harrowed spectators comprehending the appearance of the girl 's figure there , nor able to see whither she had led the five young men , until Tappingham Marsh raised a shout as he leaped out of the door and danced upon the solid earth again .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 40]: Then , indeed , there was a mighty uproar ; cheer after cheer ascended to the red vault of heaven ; women wept , men whooped , and the people rushed for the heroes with wide-open , welcoming arms .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 29]: Jefferson Bareaud and Frank Chenoweth and General Trumble dashed at Tom Vanrevel with incoherent cries of thanksgiving , shaking his hands and beating him hysterically upon the back .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 7]: He greeted them with bitter laughter .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 24]: `` Help get the water into the next warehouse ; this one is beyond control , but we can save the other two .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 9]: Take the lines in through the door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 51]: He brushed the rejoicing friends off abruptly , and went on in a queer , hollow voice : `` There are stairs -- and I 'm so sorry I did n't think of it until a moment ago , because you could have brought the water up that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 16]: A remarkable case of desertion had occurred , the previous instant , under his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 30]: As the party emerged from the warehouse into the street , Tom heard Crailey say hurriedly to Miss Carewe : `` Let me get you away come quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 24]: saw him suddenly seize her band , and , eluding the onrushing crowd , run with her round the corner of the building .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 46]: And somehow , through what inspiration , or through what knowledge of his partner 's `` temperament , '' heaven knows , the prophetic soul of the chief was unhappily assured that Crailey would offer himself as escort to her home , and find acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 4]: But why not ?
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 33]: Was it Crailey who had publicly called his fellow-man fool , idiot , imbecile , at the top of his lungs , only to find himself the proven numskull of the universe !
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 39]: Tom stood for a moment staring after the vanishing pair , while over his face stole the strangest expression that ever man saw there ; then , with meekly bowed shoulders , he turned again to his work .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 31]: At the corner of the warehouse , Miss Carewe detached her hand from Crailey 's , yet still followed him as he made a quick detour round the next building .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 21]: A minute or two later they found themselves , undetected , upon Main Street in the rear of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 4]: There Crailey paused .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 16]: `` Forgive me , '' he said , breathlessly , `` for taking your hand .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 10]: I thought you would like to get away . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 39]: She regarded him gravely , so that he found it difficult to read her look , except that it was seriously questioning ; but whether the interrogation was addressed to him or to herself he could not determine .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 16]: After a silence she said : `` I do n't know why I followed you .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 17]: I believe it must have been because you did n't give me time to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 14]: This , of course , made him even quicker with her than before .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: `` It 's all over , '' he said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 45]: `` The first warehouse is gone ; the second will go , but they 'll save the others easily enough , now that you have pointed out that the lines may be utilized otherwise than as adjuncts of performances on the high trapeze ! ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 23]: They were standing by a picket-fence , and he leaned against it , overcome by mirth in which she did not join .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 15]: Her gravity reacted upon him at once , and his laughter was stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 14]: `` Will you not accept me as an escort to your home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 4]: he said formally .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 29]: `` I do not know , '' she returned simply , the sort of honest trouble in her glance that is seen only in very young eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 8]: ` What reason in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 10]: he returned , with a crafty sharpness of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 75]: She continued to gaze upon him thoughtfully , while he tried to look into her eyes , but was baffled because the radiant beams from the lady 's orbs -LRB- as the elder Chenoweth might have said -RRB- rested somewhere dangerously near his chin , which worried him , for , though his chin made no retreat and was far from ill-looking , it was , nevertheless , that feature which he most distrusted .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you tell me why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 5]: he repeated , uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 29]: `` Because , '' she answered at last , speaking hesitatingly , `` because it is n't so easy a matter for me as you seem to think .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 26]: You have not been introduced to me , and I know you never will be , and that what you told me was true . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 10]: `` Which part of what I told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: The question escaped from him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 17]: `` That the others might come when they liked , but that you could not . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 19]: His expression altered to a sincere dejection ; his shoulders drooped , and his voice indicated supreme annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 10]: `` I might have known someone would tell you !
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 4]: Who was it ?
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 18]: Did they say why I -- '' `` On account of your quarrel with my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 8]: `` My quarrel with your father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 16]: he exclaimed ; and his face lit with an elated surprise ; his shoulders straightened .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 19]: He took a step nearer her , and asked , eagerly : `` Who told you that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 5]: `` My father himself .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 36]: He spoke of a Mr. Vanrevel whom he -- disliked , and whom I must not meet ; and , remembering what you had said , of course I knew that you were he . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 26]: Crailey 's lips began to form a smile of such appealing and inimitable sweetness that Voltaire would have trusted him ; a smile alto-gether rose-leaves .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 26]: `` Then I lose you , '' he said , `` for my only chance to know you was in keeping it hidden from you .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 6]: And now you understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 21]: `` No , '' she answered , gravely , `` I do n't understand ; that is what troubles me .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 33]: If I did , and believed you had the right of the difference , I could believe it no sin that you should speak to me , should take me home now .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 16]: I think it is wrong not to act from your own understanding of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 59]: The young man set his expression as one indomitably fixed upon the course of honor , cost what it might ; and , in the very action , his lurking pleasure in doing it hopped out in the flicker of a twinkle in his eyes , and as instantly sought cover again -- the flea in the rose-jar .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 14]: `` Then you must ask some other , '' he said , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 8]: `` A disinterested person should tell you .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 39]: The difference was political in the beginning , but became personal afterward ; and it is now a quarrel which can never be patched up , though , for my part , I wish that it could be .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 16]: I can say no more , because a party to it should not speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 57]: She met his level look squarely at last ; and no man ever had a more truthful pair of eyes than Crailey Gray , for it was his great accomplishment that he could adjust his emotion , his reason , and something that might be called his faith , to fit any situation in any character .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 11]: `` You may take me home , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 20]: `` I may be wrong , and even disloyal ; but I do not feel it so , now .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 30]: You did a very brave thing tonight to save him from loss , and I think that what you have said was just what you should have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 22]: So they went down the street , the hubbub and confusion of the fire growing more and more indistinct behind them .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 34]: They walked slowly , and , for a time , neither spoke ; yet the silence was of a kind which the adept rejoiced to have produced thus soon -- their second meeting .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 59]: For he believed there were more strange things in heaven and earth than Horatio wot ; and one of the strangest was that whenever he was near an attractive woman during a silence such as this , something not to be defined , but as effective as it was indefinite , always went out from him to her .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 30]: It was like a word of tenderness , a word too gentle , too compelling , too sweet , to be part of any tongue , spoken or written .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 19]: And more : this ineffable word had an echo , and came back to him from the woman .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 46]: As his partner had in dress , so Crailey had with women , some color of the Beau ; but it was not in what experience had given him to recognize as a fact : that they were apt to fall in love with him .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 21]: -LRB- That they were apt to remain in love with him -- he understood perfectly -- was another matter . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 47]: And he knew when they were doing it ; could have told them accurately , at each step , what they were feeling , thinking , dreaming , during the process , because he was usually exhibiting the same symptoms to himself at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 63]: Thus , his own breast occupied with that dizzy elation which followed its reception of the insane young god 's arrows , and his heart warm with the rise of the old emotion that he knew so well , he was nevertheless able to walk with his finger on the pulse of the exquisite moment , counting her heartbeats and his own .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 49]: So , to his fancy , as they walked , the little space between them was hung with brilliant strands , like gossamer chains of gold , already linking them together ; every second fixing another slender , precious fetter , binding them closer , drawing her nearer .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 17]: He waited until they passed into the shadows of the deserted Carewe Street before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 12]: There he stopped abruptly ; at which she turned , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 31]: `` Now that you have saved my life , '' he said , in a low , tremulous tone , `` what are you going to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 19]: Her eyes opened almost as widely as they had at her first sight of him in her garden .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 21]: There was a long pause before she replied , and when she did , it was to his considerable surprise .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 37]: `` I have never seen a play , except the funny little ones we acted at the convent , '' she said , `` but is n't that the way they speak on the stage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 30]: Crailey realized that his judgment of the silence bad been mistaken , and yet it was with a thrill of delight that he recognized her clear reading of him .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 7]: He had been too florid again .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: `` Let us go . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 8]: His voice was soft with restrained forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 7]: `` You mocked me once before .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 5]: `` Mocked you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 8]: she repeated , as they went on .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 10]: `` Mocked me , '' he said , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 25]: `` Mocked me for seeming theatrical , and yet you have learned that what I said was true ; as you will again . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 33]: She mused upon this ; then , as in whimsical indulgence to an importunate child : `` Well , tell me what you mean when you say I saved your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 29]: `` You came alone , '' he began , hastily , `` to stand upon that burning roof -- '' `` Whence all but him had fled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 8]: Her laughter rang out , interrupting him .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 25]: `` My room was on the fourth floor at St. Mary 's , and I did n't mind climbing three flights this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 7]: Crailey 's good-nature was always perfect .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 10]: `` You mock me and you mock me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 14]: he cried , and made her laughter but part of a gay duet .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 23]: `` I know I have gone too fast , have said things I should have waited to say ; but , ah !
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 17]: remember the small chance I have against the others who can see you when they like .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 21]: Do n't flout me because I try to make the most of a rare , stolen moment with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 4]: `` Do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 8]: she exclaimed , grave upon the instant .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 8]: `` Do make the most of it !
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 6]: I have nothing but inexperience .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: Make the most by treating me seriously .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 4]: Wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 18]: I know you can , and I -- I -- '' She faltered to a full stop .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 30]: She was earnest and quiet , and there had been something in her tone , too -- as very often there was -- that showed how young she was .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 31]: she began again , turning to him impulsively , `` I have thought about you since that evening in the garden , and I have wished I could know you .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 24]: I ca n't be quite clear how it happened , but even those few minutes left a number of strong impressions about you .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 28]: And the strongest was that you were one with whom I could talk of a great many things , if you would only be real with me .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 46]: I believe -- though I 'm not sure why I do -- that it is very difficult for you to be real ; perhaps because you are so different at different times that you are n't sure , yourself , which the real you is .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 38]: But the person that you are beginning to be for my benefit must be the most trifling of all your selves , lighter and easier to put on than the little mask you carried the other night .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: If there were nothing better underneath the mask , I might play , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 10]: `` Did you learn this at the convent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 3]: gasped Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 17]: `` There was a world there in miniature , '' she answered , speaking very quickly .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 18]: `` I think all people are made of the same materials , only in such different proportions .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 43]: I think a little world might hold as much as the largest , if you thought it all out hard enough , and your experience might be just as broad and deep in a small corner of the earth as anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 6]: But I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 11]: I want to understand -- I want to understand everything !
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 26]: I read books , and there are people -- but no one who tells me what I want -- I -- '' `` Stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 5]: He lifted his hand .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 17]: `` I wo n't act ; I shall never ` play ' for you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 15]: He was breathless ; the witching silence was nothing to what stirred him now .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 23]: A singular exaltation rose in him , together with the reckless impulse to speak from the mood her vehement confidence had in-spired .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: He gave way to it .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 12]: `` I know , I know , '' he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 15]: `` I understand all you mean , all you feel , all you wish .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 13]: It is all echoing here , and here , and here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 21]: He touched his breast , his eyes , and his forehead with the fingers of his long and slender hand .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 41]: `` We sigh and strain our eyes and stretch out our arms in the dark , groping always for the strange blessing that is just beyond our grasp , seeking for the precious unknown that lies just over the horizon !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 26]: It 's what they meant by the pot of gold where the rainbow ends -- only , it may be there , after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 16]: They stopped unconsciously , and remained standing at the lower end of the Carewe hedge .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 35]: The western glow had faded , and she was gazing at him through the darkness , leaning forward , never dreaming that her tight grasp had broken the sticks of the little pink fan .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' she whispered , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: `` You are right : you understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 44]: He went on , the words coming faster and faster : `` We are haunted -- you and I -- by the wish to know all things , and by the question that lies under every thought we have : the agonizing Whither ?
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 6]: Is n't it like that ?
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: It is really death that makes us think .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 17]: You are a good Catholic : you go to mass ; but you wish to know .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: Does God reign , or did it all happen ?
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 49]: Sometimes it seems so deadly probable that the universe just was , no God to plan it , nothing but things ; that we die as sparrows die , and the brain is all the soul we have , a thing that becomes clogged and stops some day .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 6]: And is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 14]: She shivered slightly , but her steadfast eyes did not shift from him .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 47]: He threw back his head , and his face , uplifted to the jewelled sky of the moonless night , was beatific in its peacefulness , as he continued in an altered tone , gentle and low : `` I think all questions are answered there .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 6]: The stars tell it all .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 8]: When you look at them you know !
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 8]: They have put them on our flag .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 47]: There are times when this seems but a poor nation : boastful , corrupt , violent , and preparing , as it is now , to steal another country by fraud and war ; yet the stars on the flag always make me happy and confident .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 45]: Do you see the constellations swinging above us , such unimaginable vastnesses , not roving or crashing through the illimitable at haphazard , but moving in more excellent measure , and to a finer rhythm , than the most delicate clockwork man ever made ?
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 37]: The great ocean-lines mark our seas with their paths through the water ; the fine brains of the earth are behind the ships that sail from port to port , yet how awry the system goes !
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 16]: When does a ship come to her harbor at an hour determined when she sailed ?
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 13]: What is a ship beside the smallest moon of the smallest world ?
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 33]: But , there above us , moons , worlds , suns , all the infinite cluster of colossi , move into place to the exactness of a hair at the precise instant .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 26]: That instant has been planned , you see ; it is part of a system -- and can a system exist that no mind made ?
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 9]: Think of the Mind that made this one !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 16]: Do you believe so inconceivably majestic an Intelligence as that could be anything but good ?
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 32]: Ah , when you wonder , look above you ; look above you in the night , I say , '' he cried , his hand upraised like his transfigured face .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 19]: `` Look above you and you will never fear that a sparrow 's fall could go unmarked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 35]: It was not to the stars that she looked , but to the orator , as long as he held that pose , which lasted until a hard-ridden horse came galloping down the street .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 35]: As it dashed by , though the rider looked neither to right nor left , Miss Betty unconsciously made a feverish clutch at her companion 's sleeve , drawing him closer to the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 15]: `` It is my father , '' she said hurriedly in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 7]: `` He must not see you .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 6]: You must never come here .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 19]: Perhaps -- '' She paused , then quickly whispered : `` You have been very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 19]: He looked at her keenly , and through the dimness saw that her face was shining with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 37]: He did not speak again , but , taking a step back-ward , smiled faintly , bent his head in humble acquiescence , and made a slight gesture of his hand for her to leave him .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 30]: She set her eyes upon his once more , then turned swiftly and almost ran along the hedge to the gate ; but there she stopped and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 17]: He was standing where she had left him , his face again uplifted to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 20]: She waved him an uncertain farewell , and ran into the garden , both palms against her burning cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 37]: Night is the great necromancer , and strange are the fabrics he weaves ; he lays queer spells ; breathes so eerie an intoxication through the dusk ; he can cast such glamours about a voice !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 8]: He is the very king of fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 45]: Miss Betty began to walk rapidly up and down the garden paths , her head bent and her bands still pressed to her cheeks ; now and then an unconscious exclamation burst from her , incoherent , more like a gasp than a word .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 22]: A long time she paced the vigil with her stirring heart , her skirts sweeping the dew from the leaning flowers .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 17]: Her lips moved often , but only the confused , vehement `` Oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 38]: came from them , until at last she paused in the middle of the garden , away from the trees , where all was open to the sparkling firmament , and extended her arms over her head .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 18]: `` O , strange teacher , '' she said aloud , `` I take your beautiful stars !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: I shall know how to learn from them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 15]: She gazed steadily upward , enrapt , her eyes resplendent with their own starlight .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 10]: `` Oh , stars , stars , stars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 31]: In the teeth of all wizardry , Night 's spells do pass at sunrise ; marvellous poems sink to doggerel , mighty dreams to blown ashes and solids regain weight .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 28]: Miss Betty , waking at daybreak , saw the motes dancing in the sun at her window , and watched them with a placid , unremembering eye .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 22]: She began to stare at them in a puzzled way , while a look of wonder slowly spread over her face .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: Suddenly she sat upright , as though something had startled her .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 5]: Her fingers clenched tightly .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 9]: `` Ah , if that was playing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 72]: A Tale of a Political Difference Mr. Carewe was already at the breakfast-table , but the light of his countenance , hidden behind the Rouen Journal , was not vouchsafed to his daughter when she took her place opposite him , nor did he see fit to return her morning greeting , from which she generously concluded that the burning of the two warehouses had meant a severe loss to him .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 13]: `` I am so sorry , father , '' she said gently .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 17]: -LRB- She had not called him `` papa '' since the morning after her ball . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 15]: `` I hope it is n't to be a great trouble to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 28]: There was no response , and , after waiting for some time , she spoke again , rather tremulously , yet not timidly : `` Father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 50]: He rose , and upon his brow were marked the blackest lines of anger she had ever seen , so that she leaned back from him , startled ; but he threw down the open paper before her on the table , and struck it with his clenched fist .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 5]: `` Read that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 9]: And he stood over her while she read .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 15]: There were some grandiloquent headlines : `` Miss Elizabeth Carewe an Angel of Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 10]: Charming Belle Saves the Lives of Five Prominent Citizens !
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 13]: Her Presence of Mind Prevents Conflagration from Wiping Out the City ! ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 50]: It may be noted that Will Cummings , editor and proprietor of the Journal , had written these tributes , as well as the whole account of the evening 's transactions , and Miss Betty loomed as large in Will 's narrative as in his good and lovelorn heart .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 18]: There was very little concerning the fire in the Journal ; it was nearly all about Betty .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 21]: That is one of the misfortunes which pursue a lady who allows an editor to fall in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 58]: However , there was a scant mention of the arrival of the Volunteers `` upon the scene '' -LRB- though none at all at the cause of their delay -RRB- and an elo-quent paragraph was devoted to their handsome appearance , Mr. Cummings having been one of those who insisted that the new uniforms should be worn .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 73]: `` Soon , '' said the Journal , `` through the daring of the Chief of the Department , and the Captain of the Hook-and-Ladder Company , one of whom placed and mounted the grappling-ladder , over which he was immediately followed by the other carrying the hose , a stream was sent to play upon the devouring element , a feat of derring-do personally witnessed by a majority of our readers .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 53]: Mr. Vanrevel and Mr. Gray were joined by Eugene Madrillon , Tappingham Marsh , and the editor of this paper , after which occurred the unfortunate accident to the long ladder , leaving the five named gentlemen in their terrible predicament , face to face with death in its most awful form .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 15]: At this frightful moment '' -- and all the rest was about Miss Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 16]: As Will himself admitted , he had `` laid himself out on that description . ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 17]: One paragraph was composed of short sentences , each beginning with the word `` alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: `` Alone she entered the shattered door !
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: Alone she set foot upon the first flight of stairs !
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 6]: Alone she ascended the second !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 6]: Alone she mounted the third .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 9]: Alone she lifted her hand to the trap !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 6]: Alone she opened it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 44]: She was declared to have made her appearance to the unfortunate prisoners on the roof , even as `` the palm-laden dove to the despairing Noah , '' and Will also asserted repeatedly that she was the `` Heroine of the Hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 50]: Miss Betty blushed to see her name so blazoned forth in print ; but she lacked one kind of vanity , and failed to find good reason for more than a somewhat troubled laughter , the writer 's purpose was so manifestly kind in spite of the bizarre result .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 11]: `` Oh , I wish Mr. Cummings had n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 35]: `` It would have been better not to speak of me at all , of course ; but I ca n't see that there is anything to resent -- it is so funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 4]: `` Funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 85]: Mr. Carewe repeated the word in a cracked falsetto , with the evident intention of mocking her , and at the same time hideously contorted his face into a grotesque idiocy of expression , pursing his lips so extremely , and setting his brows so awry , that his other features were cartooned out of all familiar likeness , effecting an alteration as shocking to behold , in a man of his severe cast of countenance , as was his falsetto mimicry to hear .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 36]: She rose in a kind of terror , perceiving that this contortion was produced in burlesque of her own expression , and , as he pressed nearer her , stepped back , overturning her chair .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 31]: She had little recollection of her father during her childhood ; and as long as she could remember , no one had spoken to her angrily , or even roughly .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 22]: As she retreated from him , he leaned forward , thrusting the hideous mask closer to her white and horror-stricken face .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 12]: `` You ca n't see anything to resent in that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 3]: he gibbered .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: `` It 's so funny , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 2]: Funny !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 2]: Funny !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 2]: Funny !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 17]: I 'll show you whether it 's funny or not , I 'll show you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: His voice rose almost to a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 16]: `` You hang around fires , do you , on the public streets at night ?
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 22]: You 're a nice one for me to leave in charge of my house while I 'm away , you trollop !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 11]: What did you mean by going up on that roof ?
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 8]: You knew that damned Vanrevel was there !
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: You did , I say , you knew it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 31]: She ran toward the door with a frightened cry ; but he got between it and her , menacing her with his upraised open hands , shaking them over her .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 12]: `` You 're a lovely daughter , are n't you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 4]: he shouted hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 15]: `` You knew perfectly well who was on that roof , and you went !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 5]: Did n't you go ?
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 4]: Answer me that !
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 20]: If I 'd had arms about me when I got there , I 'd have shot that man dead !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 13]: He was on my property , giving orders , the black hound !
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 48]: And when I ordered him out , he told me if I interfered with his work before it was finished , he 'd have me thrown out -- me that owned the whole place ; and there was n't a man that would lend me a pistol !
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 4]: ` Rescue ! '
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 21]: You 'd better rescue him from me , you palm-laden dove , for I 'll shoot him , I will !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: I 'll kill that dog ; and he knows it .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 13]: He can bluster in a crowd , but he 'll hide now !
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 22]: He 's a coward and -- '' `` He came home with me ; he brought me home last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 25]: Her voice rang out in the room like that of some other person , and she hardly knew that it was herself who spoke .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 5]: `` You lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 43]: he screamed , and fell back from her , his face working as though under the dominance of some physical disorder , the flesh of it plastic beyond conception , so that she cried out and covered her face with her arm .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 4]: `` You lie !
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 17]: I saw you at the hedge with Crailey Gray , though you thought I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 10]: What do you want to lie like that for ?
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 8]: Vanrevel did n't even speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 4]: I asked Madrillon .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 4]: You lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 49]: He choked upon the words ; a racking cough shook him from head to foot ; he staggered back and dropped upon her overturned chair , his arms beating the table in front of him , his head jerking spasmodically backward and forward as he gasped for breath .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 15]: `` Ring the bell , '' he panted thickly , with an incoherent gesture .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 4]: `` Nelson knows .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 3]: Ring ! ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 4]: Nelson evidently knew .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 31]: He brought brandy and water from the sideboard with no stinting hand , and within ten minutes Mr. Carewe was in his accustomed seat , competent to finish his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 15]: In solitude , however , he sat , and no one guessed his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 16]: For Miss Betty had fled to her own room , and had bolted the door .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 20]: She lay upon the bed , shuddering and shivering with nausea and cold , though the day was warm .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 51]: Then , like a hot pain in her breast , came a homesickness for St. Mary 's , and the flood-tide of tears , as she thought of the quiet convent in the sunshine over to the west , the peace of it , and the goodness of everybody there .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: `` Sister Cecilia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 30]: Her shoulders shook with the great sob that followed this name , dearest to her in the world , convulsively whispered to the pil-low `` Dear Sister Cecilia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 25]: She patted the white pillow with her hand , as though it were the cool cheek against which she yearned to lay her own .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 12]: `` Ah , you would know -- you would know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 34]: With the thought of the serene face of the good Sister , and of the kind arms that would have gone round her in her trouble , her sobbing grew loud and uncontrollable .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 19]: But she would not have her father hear it , and buried her face deep in the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 35]: After a time , she began to grow quieter , turned , and lay with wet eyes staring unseeingly at the wall , her underlip quivering with the deep intake of each broken sigh .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 10]: `` Oh , stars , stars , stars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 4]: `` Missy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: There came a soft knock upon the door and the clink of silver upon china .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 4]: `` Missy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 38]: So quick was Miss Betty that , although she answered almost at once , the tears were washed away , and she was passing a cool , wet towel over her eyes at the moment she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 4]: `` Jass me .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 10]: I brung yo ' breakfas ' , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 49]: Old Nelson 's voice was always low and gentle , with a quaver and hesitancy in the utterance ; now it was tender and comforting with the comprehension of one in suffering , the extraordinary tact , which the old of his race nearly all come to possess .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 11]: `` Li'l chicken-wing on piece brown toast , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 62]: When she opened the door he came in , bending attentively over his tray , and , without a glance toward his young mistress , made some show of fuss and bustle , as he placed it upon a table near the window and drew up a chair for her so that she could sit with her back to the light .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 5]: `` Dah now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 17]: he exclaimed softly , removing the white napkin and displaying other dainties besides the chicken wing .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 5]: `` Dass de way !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 38]: Dat ole Mamie in de kitchen , she got her failin 's an ' her grievin ' sins ; but de way she do han ` le chicken an ' biscuit sutney ai n't none on 'em !
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 15]: She plead fo ' me to ax you how you like dem biscuit . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 36]: He kept his head bent low over the table , setting a fork closer to Betty 's hand ; arranging the plates , then rearranging them , but never turning his eyes in her direction .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 10]: `` Dat ole Mamie mighty vain , yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 10]: He suffered a very quiet chuckle to escape him .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 18]: `` She did most sutney ` sist dat I ax you ai n't you like dem biscuit .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 19]: She de ve ' y vaines ' woman in dis State , dat ole Mamie , yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 24]: And now he cast one quick glance out of the corner of his eye at Miss Betty , before venturing a louder chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: `` She reckon dem biscuit goin ' git her by Sain ' Petuh when she ` proach de hevumly gates !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 2]: Uhuh !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 35]: I tell her she got git redemption fo ' de aigs she done ruin dese many yeahs ; 'cause she as useless wid an ommelick as a two-day calf on de slick ice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 7]: Here he laughed loud and long .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 25]: `` You jass go and talk wid dat Mamie , some day , Missy ; you 'll see how vain dat woman is . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 9]: `` Has father gone out , Nelson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 7]: asked Betty in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm ; he up town . ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 31]: The old man 's tone sank at once to the level of her own ; became confidential , as one speaks to another in a room where somebody is ill .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 15]: `` He mekkin ' perpetration to go down de rivuh dis aft ` noon .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 16]: He say he done broke de news to you dat he goin ' ` way .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 27]: Dey goin ' buil ' dem wa ` house right up , an ' yo ' pa he necistate go ` way ` count de contrack .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 28]: He be gone two week ' , honey , '' Nelson finished , without too much the air of imparting cheery tidings , but with just enough .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 9]: `` I am to stay here alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 6]: `` Law no , Missy !
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 90]: Dat big Miz Tanberry , dass de bes ' frien ' we all got , she home ag ` in , an ' yo ' pa goin ' invite her visit at de house , whiles he gone , an ' to stay a mont ' aftuh he git back , too , soze she kin go to all de doin 's an ' junketin 's wid you , and talk wid de young mens dat you don ' like whiles you talks wid dem you does like . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 9]: `` What time will father come home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 3]: `` Home ?
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 10]: He be gone two week ' , honey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: `` No ; I mean to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: `` Law !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 7]: He ain ' comin ' back .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 18]: Bid me pack de trunk an ' ca ' y um down to de boat at noon .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 20]: Den he bid me say far ' - ye-well an ' a kine good-bye fo ' him , honey .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 43]: ` Say he think you ai n't feelin ' too well , soze he wo n't ` sturb ye , hisself , an ' dat he unestly do hope you goin ' have splen ` id time whiles he trabblin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 14]: -LRB- Nelson 's imagination covered many deficits in his master 's courtesy . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 22]: `` Say he reckon you an ' ole Miz Tanberry goin ' git ` long mighty nice wid one ` nurr .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 39]: An ' dass what me an ' Mamie reckon ` spechually boun ' to take place , 'cause dat a mighty gay lady , dat big Miz Tanberry , an ' ole frien ' ` er owah fambly .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 15]: She ` uz a frien ' er yo ' momma 's , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 51]: Miss Betty had begun by making a pretence to eat , only to please the old man , but the vain woman 's cookery had been not unduly extolled , and Nelson laughed with pleasure to see the fluffy biscuits and the chicken wing not nibbled at but actually eaten .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 31]: This was a healthy young lady , he thought , one who would do the household credit and justify the extravagant pride which kitchen and stable already had in her .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 44]: He was an old house-servant , therefore he had seen many young ladies go through unhappy hours , and he admired Miss Betty the more because she was the first who had indulged in strong weeping and did not snuffle at intervals afterward .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 14]: He understood perfectly everything that had passed between father and daughter that morning .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 132]: When her breakfast was finished , she turned slowly to the window , and , while her eyes did not refill , a slight twitching of the upper lids made him believe that she was going over the whole scene again in her mind ; whereupon he began to move briskly about the room with a busy air , picking up her napkin , dusting a chair with his hand , exchanging the position of the andirons in the fireplace ; and , apparently discovering that the por-trait of Georges Meilhac was out of line , he set it awry , then straight again , the while he hummed an old `` spiritual '' of which only the words `` Chain de Lion Down '' were allowed to be quite audible .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 45]: They were repeated often , and at each repetition of them he seemed profoundly , though decorously , amused , in a way which might have led to a conjecture that the refrain bore some distant reference to his master 's eccentricity of temper .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 23]: At first be chuckled softly , but at the final iteration of `` Chain de Lion Down '' burst into outright laughter .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 7]: `` Honey , my Law ! ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 15]: he exclaimed , `` But yo ' pa de ` ceivin ` dest man !
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: He mighty proud er you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: `` Proud of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 7]: She turned to him in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 5]: Nelson 's laughter increased .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 12]: `` Hai n't be jass de ` ceivin ` dest man !
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 17]: Yessuh , he de sot-uppest man in dis town ` count what you done last night .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 13]: What he say dis mawn ' , dat jass his way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: `` Ah , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 6]: said Miss Betty , sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm !
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 13]: He proud er you , but he teahbul mad at dat man .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 13]: He hai n't mad at you , but he gotter cuss somebody !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 29]: Jass reach out fo ' de nighes ' he kin lay han 's on , an ' dis mawn ' it happen soze it were you , honey .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 2]: Uhuh !
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 12]: You oughter hearn him ins ' night when he come home .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 5]: Den it were me .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: Bless God , I ai n't keerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: He were n't mad at me , no mo 'n' he were at you .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 5]: He jass mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 9]: Miss Betty looked at the old fellow keenly .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 21]: He remained , however , apparently unconscious of her scrutiny , and occupied himself with preparations for removing the tray .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 15]: `` Nelson , what is the quarrel between my father and Mr. Vanrevel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 21]: He had lifted the tray , but set it down precipitately , bending upon her a surprised and sobered countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 20]: `` Missy , '' he said , gravely , `` Dey big trouble ` twix ' dem two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 9]: `` I know , '' she returned quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 12]: `` Wha ' fo ' you ax me , Missy ? ''

Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 13]: I do n't know anyone here well enough , except you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 6]: Nelson 's lips puckered solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 15]: `` Mist ' Vanrevel vote Whig ; but he ag ` in Texas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 9]: `` Well , what if he is ? ''

Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 23]: The old man 's gravity gave way to his enjoyment of the recollection , and he threw back his head to laugh .

Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 2]: Uhuh !

Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 19]: Nevertheless , as he lifted the tray again and crossed the room to go , his solemnity returned .

Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 11]: `` He was mistaken , it was Mr. Vanrevel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 8]: Nelson rolled his eyes fervently to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 11]: `` Den dat young man run pintedly on he death !

Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 56]: This was the speech he chose for his exit , but , after closing the door behind him , he opened it again , and said , cheerfully : `` Soon 's I git de trunk fix f ' yo ' pa , I bring ` roun ' dat bay colt wid de side saddle .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 17]: You better set ` bout gittin ' on yo ' ridin ' - habit , Missy .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 10]: De roads is mighty good dis sunshiny wedduh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 4]: `` Nelson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 18]: `` Do you think such an attack as father had this morning -- is -- dangerous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 21]: He had hoped for another chance to laugh violently before he left her , and this completely fitted his desire .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 8]: `` Ho , ho , he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: `` No 'm , no , no , honey !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 10]: He jass git so mad it mek him sick .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 13]: You couldn ' kill dat man wid a broad-ax , Missy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 15]: And he went down the hail leaving the reverberations of his hilarity behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 52]: The purpose of his visit had been effected , for , when Miss Betty appeared upon the horse-block in her green habit and gauntlets , she was smiling ; so that only a woman -- or a wise old man -- could have guessed that she had wept bitterly that morning .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 53]: She cantered out to the flat , open country to the east , where she found soft dirt-roads that were good for the bay colt 's feet , and she reached a cross-road several miles from town before she was overcome by the conviction that she was a wicked and ungrateful girl .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 28]: She could not place the exact spot of her guilt , but she knew it was there , somewhere , since she felt herself a guilty thing .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 41]: For the picture which Nelson had drawn rose before her : the one man standing alone in his rage on the platform , overwhelmed by his calm young adversary , beaten and made the butt of laughter for a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 51]: Her father had been in the wrong in that quarrel , and somehow she was sure , too , he must have been wrong in the `` personal '' one , as well : the mysterious difficulty over Fanchon 's Mr. Gray , who had looked so ashamed last night .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 15]: What feud could they make over him , of all people in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 33]: He looked strong enough to take care of his own quarrels , even if he was so rigorously bound by Fanchon 's apron-string when it came to a word with another girl !
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 27]: But the conclusion that her father had been in error did not lessen the pathetic appeal of the solitary figure facing the ridicule of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 63]: She felt that he always honestly believed himself in the right ; she knew that he was vain ; that he had an almost monstrous conception of his dignity ; and , realizing the bitterness of that public humiliation which he had undergone , she understood the wrath , the unspeakable pain and sense of outrage , which must have possessed him .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 51]: And now she was letting him go forth upon a journey -- his way beset with the chances of illness and accident -- whence he might never return ; she was letting him go without seeing him again ; letting him go with no word of farewell from his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: In brief : she was a wicked girl .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 18]: She turned the colt 's head abruptly to the west and touched his flanks with her whip .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 59]: So it fell out that as the packet foamed its passage backward from Carewe 's wharf into the current , the owner of the boat , standing upon the hurricane deck , heard a cry from the shore , and turned to behold his daughter dash down to the very end of the wharf on the well-lathered colt .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 26]: Miss Betty 's hair was blown about her face ; her cheeks were rosy , her eager eyes sparkling from more than the hard riding .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 4]: `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: she cried , `` I 'm sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 46]: She leaned forward out of the saddle , extending her arms to him appealingly in a charming gesture , and , absolutely ignoring the idlers on the wharf and the passengers on the steamer , was singly intent upon the tall figure on the hurricane-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 5]: `` Papa -- good-by .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 5]: Please forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 13]: `` By the Almighty , but that 's a fine woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 12]: said the captain of the boat to a passenger from Rouen .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 7]: `` Is she his daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 6]: `` Please forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 57]: the clear voice came again , with its quaver of entreaty , across the widening water ; and then , as Mr. Carewe made no sign , by word or movement , of hearing her , and stood without the slightest alteration of his attitude , she cried to him once more : `` Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 50]: The paddle-wheels reversed ; the boat swung down the river , Mr. Carewe still standing immovable on the hurricane-deck , while , to the gaze of those on the steamer , the figure on the bay colt at the end of the wharf began to grow smaller and smaller .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 43]: She was waving her handkerchief in farewell , and they could see the little white speck in the distance , dimmer and dimmer , yet fluttering still as they passed out of sight round the bend nearly three-quarters of a mile below .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 19]: The Rule of the Regent Betty never forgot her first sight of the old friend of her family .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 45]: Returning with a sad heart , she was walking the colt slowly through the carriage-gates , when an extravagantly stout lady , in green muslin illustrated with huge red flowers , came out upon the porch and waved a fat arm to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 37]: The visitor wore a dark-green turban and a Cashmere shawl , while the expanse of her skirts was nothing short of magnificent : some cathedral-dome seemed to have been misplaced and the lady dropped into it .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 17]: Her outstretched hand terrified Betty : how was she to approach near enough to take it ?
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 48]: Mrs. Tanberry was about sixty , looked forty , and at first you might have guessed she weighed nearly three hundred , but the lightness of her smile and the actual buoyancy which she somehow imparted to her whole dominion lessened that by at least a hundred-weight .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 50]: She ballooned out to the horse-block with a billowy rush somewhere between bounding and soaring ; and Miss Betty slid down from the colt , who shied violently , to find herself enveloped , in spite of the dome , in a vast surf of green and red muslin .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: `` My charming girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 44]: exclaimed the lady vehemently , in a voice of such husky richness , of such merriment and unction of delight , that it fell upon Miss Betty 's ear with more of the quality of sheer gayety than any she had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 4]: `` Beautiful child !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 8]: What a beautiful child you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 29]: She kissed the girl resoundingly on both cheeks ; stepped back from her and laughed , and clapped her fat hands , which were covered with flashing rings .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 11]: `` Oh , but you are a true blue Beauty !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 5]: You 're a Princess !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 12]: I am Mrs. Tanberry , Jane Tanberry , young Janie Tanberry .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 21]: I have n't seen you since you were a baby and your pretty mother was a girl like us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 13]: `` You are so kind to come , '' said Betty hesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 10]: `` I shall try to be very obedient . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 4]: `` Obedient ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 9]: Mrs. Tanberry uttered the word with a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 9]: `` You 'll be nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 26]: I am the light-mindedest woman in the universe , and anyone who obeyed me would be embroiled in everlasting trouble every second in the day .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 17]: You 'll find that I am the one that needs looking after , my charmer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 18]: She tapped Miss Betty 's cheek with her jeweled fingers as the two mounted the veranda steps .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 21]: `` It will be worry enough for you to obey yourself ; a body sees that at the first blush .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 12]: You have conscience in your forehead and rebellion in your chin .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 22]: Here Mrs. Tanberry sat upon , and obliterated , a large chair , Miss Carewe taking a stool at her knee .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 30]: `` People of our age ought n't to be bothered with obeying ; there 'll be time enough for that when we get old and ca n't enjoy anything .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 5]: Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 40]: Mrs. Tanberry punctuated her observations with short volleys of husky laughter , so abrupt in both discharge and cessation that , until Miss Betty became accustomed to the habit , she was apt to start slightly at each salvo .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 21]: `` I had a husband -- once , '' the lady resumed , `` but only once , my friend !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 15]: He had ideas like your father 's -- your father is such an imbecile !
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 55]: -- and he thought that wives , sisters , daughters , and such like ought to be obedient : that is , the rest of the world was wrong unless it was right ; and right was just his own little , teeny-squeeny prejudices and emotions dressed up for a crazy masquerade as Facts .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 3]: Poor man !
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: He only lasted about a year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 6]: And Mrs. Tanberry laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 14]: `` They 've been at me time and again to take another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 10]: She lowered her voice and leaned toward Betty confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 4]: `` Not I !
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 53]: I 'd be willing to engage myself to Crailey Gray -LRB- though Crailey has n't got round to me yet -RRB- for I do n't mind just being engaged , my dear ; but they 'll have to invent something better than a man before I marry any one of 'em again !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 12]: But I love 'em , I do , the Charming Billies !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 10]: And you 'll see how they follow me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 13]: She patted the girl 's shoulder , her small eyes beaming quizzically .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 12]: `` We 'll have the gayest house in Rouen , ladybird !
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 27]: The young men all go to the Bareauds ' , but they 'll come here now , and we 'll have the Bareauds along with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 24]: I 've been away a long time , just finished unpacking yesterday night when your father came in after the fire -- Whoo !
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 13]: what a state he was in with that devilish temper of his !
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 17]: Did n't I snap him up when he asked me to come and stay with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 50]: I 'd have come , even if you had n't been beautiful ; but I was wild to be your playmate , for I 'd heard nothing but ` Miss Betty Carewe , Miss Betty Carewe ' from everybody I saw , since the minute my stage came in .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 23]: You set 'em all mad at your ball , and I knew we 'd make a glorious house-full , you and I !
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 19]: Some of the vagabonds will turn up this very evening , you 'll see if they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 7]: The way they follow me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 71]: Mrs. Tanberry was irresistible : she filled the whole place otherwise than by the mere material voluminousness of her ; bubbling over with froth of nonsense which flew through the house , driven by her energy , like sea-foam on a spring gale ; and the day , so discordantly begun for Miss Betty , grew musical with her own laughter , answering the husky staccato of the vivacious newcomer .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 59]: Nelson waited upon them at table , radiant , his smile like the keyboard of an ebony piano , and his disappearances into the kitchen were accomplished by means of a surreptitious double-shuffle , and followed by the cachinnating echoes of the vain Mamie 's reception of the visitor 's sallies , which Nelson hastily retailed in passing .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 23]: Nor was Mrs. Tanberry 's prediction allowed to go unfulfilled regarding the advent of those persons whom she had designated as vagabonds .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 97]: It may have been out of deference to Mr. Carewe 's sense of decorum -LRB- or from a cautious regard of what he was liable to do when he considered that sense outraged -RRB- that the gallants of Rouen had placed themselves under the severe restraint of allowing three days to elapse after their introduction to Miss Carewe before they `` paid their respects at the house ; '' but , be that as it may , the dictator was now safely under way down the Rouen River , and Mrs. Tanberry reigned in his stead .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 75]: Thus , at about eight o'clock that evening , the two ladies sat in the library engaged in conversation -- though , for the sake of accuracy , it should be said that Mrs. Tanberry was engaged in conversation , Miss Betty in giving ear -- when their attention was arrested by sounds of a somewhat musical nature from the lawn , which sounds were immediately identified as emanating from a flute and violin .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 32]: Mrs. Tanberry bounded across the room like a public building caught by a cyclone , and , dashing at the candles , `` Blow 'em out , blow 'em out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 15]: she exclaimed , suiting the action to the word in a fluster of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 13]: asked Miss Carewe , startled , as she rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 9]: The candles were out before the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 4]: ` Why ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 10]: repeated the merry , husky voice in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 12]: `` My goodness , child precious , those vagabonds are here !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 11]: To think of your never having been serenaded before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 20]: She drew the girl to the window and pointed to a group of dim figures near the iliac bushes .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 8]: `` The dear , delightful vagabonds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 3]: she chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 7]: `` I knew they 'd come !
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 33]: It 's the beautiful Tappingham Marsh with his fiddle , and young Jeff Bareaud with his flute , and ` Gene Madrillon and little Frank Chenowith and thin Will Cummings to sing .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 6]: Hark to the rascals ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 59]: It is perfectly truthful to say that the violin and flute executed the prelude , and then the trio sounded full on the evening air , the more effective chords obligingly drawn out as long as the breath in the singers could hold them , in order to allow the two fair auditors complete benefit of the harmony .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 25]: They sang `` The Harp that Once Thro ' Tara 's Halls , '' and followed it with `` Long , Long Ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 24]: `` That , '' Mrs. Tanberry whispered , between stifled gusts of almost uncontrollable laughter , `` is meant for just me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 17]: `` Tell me the tales that to me were so dear , '' entreated the trio .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 7]: `` I told 'em plenty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 5]: gurgled the enlivening widow .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 14]: `` And I expect between us we can get up some more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 14]: `` Now you are come my grief is removed , '' they sang .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 18]: `` They mean your father is on his way to St. Louis , '' remarked Mrs. Tanberry .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 30]: `` Let me forget that so long you have roved , Let me believe that you love as you loved , Long , long ago , long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: `` Applaud , applaud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 14]: whispered Mrs. Tanberry , encouraging the minstrels by a hearty clapping of hands .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 47]: Hereupon dissension arose among the quintet , evidently a dispute in regard to their next selection ; one of the gentlemen appearing more than merely to suggest a solo by himself , while the others too frankly expressed adverse opinions upon the value of the offering .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 15]: The argument became heated , and in spite of many a `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: and `` Not so loud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 22]: the ill-suppressed voice of the intending soloist , Mr. Chenoweth , could be heard vehemently to exclaim : `` I will !
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 8]: I learned it especially for this occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 6]: I will sing it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 87]: His determination , patently , was not to be balked without physical encounter , consequently he was permitted to advance some paces from the lilac bushes , where he delivered himself , in an earnest and plaintive tenor , of the following morbid instructions , to which the violin played an obligato in tremulo , so execrable , and so excruciatingly discordant , that Mr. Chenoweth 's subsequent charge that it was done with a deliberately evil intention could never be successfully opposed : `` Go !
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 3]: Forget me !
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 10]: Why should Sorrow O'er that brow a shadow fling ?
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 2]: Go !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 13]: Forget me , and , to-morrow , Brightly smile and sweetly sing !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 3]: `` Smile !
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 11]: tho ' I may not be near thee ; Smile !
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 22]: tho ' I may never see thee ; May thy soul with pleasure shine Lasting as this gloom of mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 42]: Miss Carewe complied at once with the request ; while her companion , unable to stop with the slight expression of pleasure demanded by the songster , threw herself upon a sofa and gave way to the mirth that consumed her .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 25]: Then the candles were relit , the serenaders invited within ; Nelson came bearing cake and wine , and the house was made merry .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 42]: Presently , the romp , Virginia Bareaud , making her appearance on the arm of General Trumble , Mrs. Tanberry led them all in a hearty game of Blind-man 's Buff , followed by as hearty a dancing of Dan Tucker .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 24]: After that , a quadrille being proposed , Mrs. Tanberry suggested that Jefferson should run home and bring Fanchon for the fourth lady .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 61]: However , Virginia explained that she had endeavored to persuade both her sister and Mr. Gray to accompany the General and herself , but that Mr. Gray had complained of indisposition , having suffered greatly from headache , on account of inhaling so much smoke at the warehouse fire ; and , of course , Fanchon would not leave him .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 13]: -LRB- Miss Carewe permitted herself the slightest shrug of the shoulders . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 38]: So they danced the quadrille with Jefferson at the piano and Mr. Marsh performing in the character of a lady , a proceeding most unacceptable to the General , whom Mrs. Tanberry forced to be his partner .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 87]: And thus the evening passed gayly away , and but too quickly , to join the ghosts of all the other evenings since time began ; and each of the little company had added a cheerful sprite to the long rows of those varied shades that the after years bring to revisit us , so many with pathetic reproach , so many bearing a tragic burden of faces that we can not make even to weep again , and so few with simple merriment and lightheartedness .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 21]: Tappingham Marsh spoke the truth , indeed , when he exclaimed in parting , `` O rare Mrs. Tanberry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 11]: But the house had not done with serenades that night .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 57]: The guests had long since departed ; the windows were still and dark under the wan old moon , which had risen lamely , looking unfamiliar and not half itself ; the air bore an odor of lateness , and nothing moved ; when a delicate harmony stole out of the shadows beyond the misty garden .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 57]: Low but resonant chords sounded on the heavier strings of a guitar , while above them , upon the lighter wires , rippled a slender , tinkling melody that wooed the slumberer to a delicious half-wakefulness , as dreamily , as tenderly , as the croon of rain on the roof soothes a child to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 48]: Under the artist 's cunning touch the instrument was both the accompaniment and the song ; and Miss Betty , at first taking the music to be a wandering thread in the fabric of her own bright dreams , drifted gradually to consciousness to find herself smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 17]: Her eyes opened wide , but half closed again with the ineffable sweetness of the sound .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 23]: Then a voice was heard , eerily low , yet gallant and clear , a vibrant baritone , singing to the guitar .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 19]: `` My lady 's hair , That dark delight , Is both as fair And dusk as night .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 27]: I know some lovelorn hearts that beat In time to moonbeam twinklings fleet , That dance and glance like jewels there , Emblazoning the raven hair !
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 6]: `` Ah , raven hair !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 13]: So dark and bright , What loves lie there Enmeshed , to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 30]: I know some sighing lads that say Their hearts were snared and torn away ; And now as pearls one fate they share , Entangled in the raven hair .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 17]: `` Ah , raven hair , From such a plight Could you not spare One acolyte ?
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 14]: I know a broken heart that went To serve you but as ornament .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 12]: a ruby now you wear , Ensanguining the raven hair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 43]: The song had grown fainter and fainter , the singer moving away as he sang , and the last lines were almost inaudible in the distance The guitar could be heard for a moment or two more , then silence came again .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 32]: It was broken by a rustling in the room next to Miss Betty 's , and Mrs. Tanberry called softly through the open door : `` Princess , are you awake ?
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 7]: Did you hear that serenade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 22]: After a pause the answer came hesitatingly in a small , faltering voice : `` Yes -- if it was one .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 15]: I thought perhaps he was only singing as he passed along the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 15]: ejaculated Mrs. Tanberry , abruptly , as though she had made an unexpected discovery .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 17]: `` You knew better ; and this was a serenade that you did not laugh at .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 18]: Beautiful , I would n't let it go any farther , even while your father is gone .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 16]: Something might occur that would bring him home without warning -- such things have happened .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 13]: Tom Vanrevel ought to be kept far away from this house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 15]: `` Oh , it was not he , '' returned Miss Betty , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 6]: `` It was Mr. Gray .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 22]: Did n't you -- '' `` My dear , '' interrupted the other , `` Crailey Gray 's specialty is talking .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 61]: Most of the vagabonds can sing and play a bit , and so can Crailey , particularly when he 's had a few bowls of punch ; but when Tom Vanrevel touches the guitar and lifts up his voice to sing , there is n't an angel in heaven that would n't quit the place and come to hear him !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 8]: Crailey wrote those words to Virginia Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 13]: -LRB- Her hair is even darker than yours , you know . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 38]: That was when he was being engaged to her ; and Tom must have set the music to 'em lately , and now comes here to sing 'em to you ; and well enough they fit you !
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 10]: But you must keep him away , Princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 76]: Nevertheless , Betty knew the voice was not that which had bid her look to the stars , and she remained convinced that it belonged to Mr. Crailey Gray , who had been too ill , a few hours earlier , to leave the Bareaud house , and now , with Fanchon 's kisses on his lips , came stealing into her garden and sang to her a song he had made for another girl !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 15]: And the angels would leave heaven to listen when he sang , would they ?
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 3]: Poor Fanchon !
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 11]: No wonder she held him so tightly in leading strings !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 36]: He might risk his life all he wished at the end of a grappling-ladder , dangling in a fiery cloud above nothing ; but when it came to -- ah , well , poor Fanchon !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 18]: Did she invent the headaches for him , or did she make him invent them for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 29]: If there was one person in the world whom Miss Betty held in bitter contempt and scorn , it was the owner of that voice and that guitar .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 75]: CHAPTER X. Echoes of a Serenade More than three gentlemen of Rouen wore their hearts in their eyes for any fool to gaze upon ; but three was the number of those who told their love before the end of the first week of Mr. Carewe 's absence , and told it in spite of Mrs. Tanberry 's utmost effort to preserve , at all times , a conjunction between herself and Miss Betty .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 31]: For the good lady , foreseeing these declarations much more surely than did the subject of them , wished to spare her lovely charge the pain of listening to them .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 75]: Miss Carewe honored each of the lorn three with few minutes of gravity ; but the gentle refusal prevented never a swain from being as truly her follower as before ; not that she resorted to the poor device of half-dismissal , the every-day method of the school-girl flirt , who thus keeps the lads in dalliance , but because , even for the rejected , it was a delight to be near her .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 20]: For that matter , it is said that no one ever had enough of the mere looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 25]: Also , her talk was enlivening even to the lively , being spiced with surprising turns and amiably seasoned with the art of badinage .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 33]: To use the phrase of the time , she possessed the accomplishments , an antiquated charm now on the point of disappearing , so carefully has it been snubbed under whenever exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 58]: The pursuing wraith of the young , it comes to sit , a ghost at every banquet , driving the flower of our youth to unheard-of exertions in search of escape , to dubious diplomacy , to dismal inaction , or to wine ; yet time was when they set their hearts on `` the accomplishments . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 9]: Miss Betty Carewe at her harp , ah !
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 145]: it was a dainty picture : the clear profile , with the dark hair low across the temple , silhouetted duskily , in the cool , shadowy room , against the open window ; the slender figure , one arm curving between you and the strings , the other gleaming behind them ; the delicate little sandal stealing from the white froth of silk and lace to caress the pedal ; the nimble hands fluttering across the long strands , `` Like white blossoms borne on slanting lines of rain ; '' and the great gold harp rising to catch a javelin of sunshine that pierced the vines at the window where the honeysuckles swung their skirts to the refrain -- it was a picture to return many a long year afterward , and thrill the reveries of old men who were then young .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 57]: And , following the light cascading ripples of the harp , when her low contralto lifted in one of the `` old songs , '' she often turned inquiringly to see if the listener liked the music , and her brilliant , dark eyes would rest on his with an appeal that blinded his entranced soul .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 26]: She meant it for the mere indication of a friendly wish to suit his tastes , but it looked like the divine humility of love .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 14]: Nobody wondered that General Trumble should fall to verse-making in his old age .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: She sketched magnificently .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 31]: This is the very strongest support for the assertion : Frank Chenoweth and Tappingham Marsh agreed , with tears of enthusiasm , that `` magnificently '' was the only word .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 34]: They came to this conclusion as they sat together at the end of a long dinner -LRB- at which very little had been eaten -RRB- after a day 's picnic by the river .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 20]: Miss Carewe had been of their company , and Tappingham and Chenoweth found each his opportunity in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 24]: The party was small , and no one had been able to effect a total unconsciousness of the maneuvers of the two gentle-men .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 45]: Even Fanchon Bareaud comprehended languidly , though she was more blurred than ever , and her far-away eyes belied the mechanical vivacity of her manner , for Crailey was thirty miles down the river , with a fishing-rod neatly packed in a leather case .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 35]: Mr. Vanrevel , of course , was not invited ; no one would have thought of asking him to join a small party of which Robert Carewe 's daughter was to be a member .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 55]: But it was happiness enough for Tom , that night , to lie hidden in the shrubbery , looking up at the stars between the leaves , while he listened to her harp , and borne through the open window on enchanted airs , the voice of Elizabeth Carewe singing `` Robin Adair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 31]: It was now that the town indulged its liveliest spirit ; never an evening lacked its junketing , while the happy folk of Rouen set the early summer to music .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 19]: Serenade , dance , and song for them , the light-hearts , young and old making gay together !
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 35]: It was all laughter , either in sunshine or by candlelight , undisturbed by the far thunder below the southern horizon , where Zachary Taylor had pitched his tent , upon the Rio Grande .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 56]: One fair evening , soon after that excursion which had proved fatal to the hopes of the handsome Tappingham and of the youthful Chenoweth , it was the privilege of Mr. Thomas Vanrevel to assist Miss Carewe and her chaperon from their carriage , as they drove up to a dance at the Bareauds ' .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 29]: This good fortune fell only to great deserving , for he had spent an hour lurking outside the house in the hope of performing such offices for them .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 62]: Heaven was in his soul and the breath departed out of his body , when , after a moment of hesitation , Miss Betty 's little lace-gauntleted glove was placed in his hand , and her white slipper shimmered out from the lilac flounces of her dress to fall like a benediction , he thought , on each of the carriage-steps .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 38]: It was the age of garlands ; they wreathed the Muses , the Seasons , and their speech , so the women wore wreaths in their hair , and Miss Betty 's that night was of marguerites .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 42]: `` Read your fortune in them all , '' whispered Tom 's heart , `` and of whomsoever you wish to learn , every petal will say ` He loves you ; none declare , He loves you not ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 27]: She bowed slightly , but did not speak to him , which was perhaps a better reception than that accorded the young man by her companion .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 11]: `` Oh , it 's you , is it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 15]: was Mrs. Tanberry 's courteous observation as she canted the vehicle in her descent .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 26]: She looked sharply at Miss Betty , and even the small glow of the carriage-lamps showed that the girl 's cheeks had flushed very red .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 10]: Mr. Vanrevel , on the contrary , was pale .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 36]: They stood for a moment in awkward silence , while , from the lighted house where the flying figures circled , came the waltz : `` I dreamt that I dwe-helt in ma-har-ble halls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 34]: Tom 's own dreams were much wilder than the gypsy girl 's ; he knew that ; yet he spoke out bravely : `` Will you dance the two first with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 82]: Miss Betty bit her lip , frowned , turned away , and , vouchsafing no reply , walked toward the house with her eyes fixed on the ground ; but just as they reached the door she flashed over him a look that scorched him from head to foot , and sent his spirits down through the soles of his boots to excavate a grotto in the depths of the earth , so charged it was with wrathful pity and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 12]: she said abruptly , and followed Mrs. Tanberry to the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 20]: The elder lady shook her head solemnly as she emerged from the enormous folds of a yellow silk cloak .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 44]: `` Ah , Princess , '' she said , touching the girl 's shoulder with her jeweled hand , `` I told you I was a very foolish woman , and I am , but not so foolish as to offer advice often .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 10]: Yet , believe me , it wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 27]: I think that is one of the greatest young men I ever knew , and it 's a pity -- but it wo n't do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 13]: Miss Betty kept her face away from her guardian for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 64]: No inconsiderable amount of information had drifted to her , from here and there , regarding the career of Crailey Gray , and she thought how intensely she would have hated any person in the world except Mrs. Tanberry for presuming to think she needed to be warned against the charms of this serenading lady-killer , who was the property of another girl .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 17]: `` You must keep him away , I think , '' ventured Mrs. Tanberry , gently .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 15]: At that Betty turned to her and said , sharply : `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 13]: After this , please let us never speak of him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 14]: A slow nod of the other 's turbaned head indicated the gravest acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 11]: She saw that her companion 's cheeks were still crimson .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: `` I understand , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 24]: A buzz of whispering , like a July beetle , followed Miss Carewe and her partner about the room during the next dance .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 6]: How had Tom managed it ?
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 7]: Had her father never told her ?
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: Who had dared to introduce them ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 36]: Fanchon was the only one who knew , and as she whirled by with Will Cummings , she raised her absent glance long enough to give Tom an affectionate and warning shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 10]: Tom did not see this ; Miss Carewe did .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: She smiled upon him instantly and looked deep into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 6]: It was the third time .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 18]: She was not afraid of this man-flirt ; he was to be settled with once and forever .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 39]: She intended to avenge both Fanchon and herself ; yet it is a hazardous game , this piercing of eye with eye , because the point which seeks to penetrate may soften and melt , leaving one defenseless .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 99]: For perhaps ten seconds that straight look lasted , while it seemed to her that she read clear into the soul of him , and to behold it , through some befooling magic , as strong , tender , wise , and true , as his outward appearance would have made an innocent stranger believe him ; for he looked all these things ; she admitted that much ; and he had an air of distinction and resource beyond any she had ever known , even in the wild scramble for her kitten he had not lost it .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 54]: So , for ten seconds , which may be a long time , she saw a man such as she had dreamed , and she did not believe her sight , because she had no desire to be as credulous as the others , to be as easily cheated as that poor Fanchon !
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 58]: The luckless Tom found his own feet beautiful on the mountains , and , treading the heights with airy steps , appeared to himself wonderful and glorified -- he was waltzing with Miss Betty He breathed the entrancing words to himself , over and over : it was true , he was waltzing with Miss Betty Carewe !
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 21]: Her glove lay warm and light within his own ; his fingers clasped that ineffable lilac and white brocade waist .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 26]: Sometimes her hair came within an inch of his cheek , and then he rose outright from the hilltops and floated in a golden mist .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 55]: The glamour of which the Incroyable had planned to tell her some day , surrounded Tom , and it seemed to him that the whole world was covered with a beautiful light like a carpet , which was but the radiance of this adorable girl whom his gloves and coat-sleeve were permitted to touch .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 38]: When the music stopped , they followed in the train of other couples seeking the coolness of out-of-doors for the interval , and Tom , in his soul , laughed at all other men with illimitable condescension .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 15]: `` Stop here , '' she said , as they reached the open gate .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 20]: He was walking out of it , his head in the air , and Miss Betty on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 11]: Apparently , he would have walked straight across the State .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 10]: It was the happiest moment he had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 56]: He wanted to say something wonderful to her ; his speech should be like the music and glory and lire that was in him ; therefore he was shocked to hear himself remarking , with an inanity of utterance that sickened him : `` Oh , here 's the gate , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: Her answer was a short laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: `` You mean you wish to persuade me that you had forgotten it was there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 13]: `` I did not see it , '' he protested , lamentably .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 9]: `` I was n't thinking of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 15]: You were ` lost in thoughts of ' -- '' `` Of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 9]: he said , before he could check himself .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 12]: Her tone was as quietly contemptuous as she could make it .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 7]: `` How very frank of you !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 21]: May I ask : Are you convinced that speeches of that sort are always to a lady 's liking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 13]: `` No , '' he answered humbly , and hung his head .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 22]: Then she threw the question at him abruptly : `` Was it you who came to sing in our garden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 22]: There was a long pause before a profound sigh came tremulously from the darkness , like a sad and tender confession .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 6]: `` I thought so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Tanberry thought it was someone else ; but I knew that it was you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 13]: `` Yes , you are right , '' he said , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 5]: `` It was I .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 14]: It was my only way to tell you what you know now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 5]: `` Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 17]: She set it all aside with those two words and the slightest gesture of her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 14]: `` It was a song made for another girl , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 28]: she asked lightly , and with an icy smile , inquired farther : `` For the one -- the one before the last , I understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 7]: He lifted his head , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 9]: `` What has that to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 20]: The music was made for you -- but then , I think all music was made for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 18]: `` Leave the music out of it , if you please , '' she said , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 7]: `` Your talents make you modest !
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 35]: No doubt you consider it unmaidenly in me to have referred to the serenade before you spoke of it ; but I am not one to cast down my eyes and let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 14]: No , nor one too sweet to face the truth , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 6]: she cried with sudden passion .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 23]: `` To sing that song in the way you did , meant -- oh , you thought I would flirt with you !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 14]: What right had you to come with such a song to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 50]: Tom intended only to disclaim the presumption , so far from his thoughts , that his song had moved her , for he could see that her attack was prompted by her inexplicable impression that he had assumed the attitude of a conqueror , but his explanation began unfortunately .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 4]: `` Forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 27]: I think you have completely misunderstood ; you thought it meant something I did not intend , at all , and -- '' `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 21]: she said , and her eyes blazed , for now she beheld him as the arrant sneak of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 92]: He , the lady-killer , with his hypocritical air of strength and melancholy sweetness , the leader of drunken revels , and , by reputation , the town Lothario and Light-o ' - Love , under promise of marriage to Fanchon Bareaud , had tried to make love to another girl , and now his cowardice in trying to disclaim what he had done lent him the insolence to say to this other : `` My child , you are betrayed by your youth and conceit ; you exaggerate my meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 13]: I had no intention to distinguish you by coquetting with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 36]: This was her interpretation of him ; and her indignation was not lessened by the inevitable conclusion that he , who had been through so many scenes with women , secretly found her simplicity diverting .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 40]: Miss Betty had a little of her father in her ; while it was part of her youth , too , that , of all things she could least endure the shadow of a smile at her own expense .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 6]: `` Oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 9]: she cried , her voice shaking with anger .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 15]: `` I suppose your bad heart is half-choked with your laughter at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 10]: She turned from him swiftly , and left him .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 28]: Almost running , she entered the house , and hurried to a seat by Mrs. Tanberry , nestling to her like a young sapling on a hillside .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 77]: Instantaneously , several gentlemen , who had hastily acquitted themselves of various obligations in order to seek her , sprang forward with eager greetings , so that when the stricken Tom , dazed and confounded by his evil luck , followed her at about five paces , he found himself confronted by an impenetrable abbatis formed by the spiked tails of the coats of General Trumble , Madrillon , Tappingham Marsh , Cummings and Jefferson Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: Within this fortification rang out laughter and sally from Miss Carewe ; her color was high and her eyes sparkled never more brightly .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 8]: Flourish and alarums sounded for a quadrille .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 60]: Each of the semi-circle , firmly elbowing his neighbor , begged the dance of Miss Betty ; but Tom was himself again , and laid a long , strong hand on Madrillon 's shoulder , pressed him gently aside , and said : `` Forgive me ; Miss Carewe has honored me by the promise of this quadrille . ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 21]: He bowed , offering his arm , and none of them was too vain to envy that bow and gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 7]: For a moment he remained waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 32]: Miss Carewe rose slowly , and , directly facing him , said in composed and even voice : `` You force me to beg you never to address me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 17]: She placed her hand on the General 's arm , turning her back squarely upon Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 57]: In addition to those who heard , many persons in that part of the room saw the affront and paused in arrested attitudes ; others , observing these , turned inquiringly , so that sudden silence fell , broken only by the voice of Miss Betty as she moved away , talking cheerily to the General .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 10]: Tom was left standing alone in the broken semicircle .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 20]: All the eyes swept from her to him and back ; then everyone began to talk hastily about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 8]: The young man 's humiliation was public .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 38]: He went to the door under cover of the movement of the various couples to find places in the quadrille , yet every sidelong glance in the room still rested upon him , and he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 61]: He remained in the ball , alone , through that dance , and at its conclusion , walked slowly through the rooms , speaking to people , here and there , as though nothing had happened , but when the music sounded again , he went to the dressing-room , found his hat and cloak , and left the house .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 40]: For a while he stood on the opposite side of the street , watching the lighted windows , and twice he caught sight of the lilac and white brocade , the dark hair , and the wreath of marguerites .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: Then , with a hot pain in his breast , and the step of a Grenadier , he marched down the street .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 12]: In the carriage Mrs. Tanberry took Betty 's hand in hers .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 33]: `` I 'll do as you wish , child , '' she said , `` and never speak to you of him again as long as I live , except this once .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 30]: I think it was best for his own sake as well as yours , but -- '' `` He needed a lesson , '' interrupted Miss Betty , wearily .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 13]: She had danced long and hard , and she was very tired .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 9]: Mrs. Tanberry 's staccato laugh came out irrepressibly .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 9]: `` All the vagabonds do , Princess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: `` And I think they are getting it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 54]: `` No , no , I do n't mean -- '' `` We 've turned their heads , my dear , between us , you and I ; and we 'll have to turn 'em again , or they 'll break their necks looking over their shoulders at us , the owls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: She pressed the girl 's hand affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 25]: `` But you 'll let me say something just once , and forgive me because we 're the same foolish age , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 19]: It 's only this : The next young man you suppress , take him off in a corner !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 21]: Lead him away from the crowd where he wo n't have to stand and let them look at him afterward .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 14]: That 's all , my dear , and you must n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: said Miss Betty hotly .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 12]: `` No , no , '' said Mrs. Tanberry , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 13]: `` It was better this time to do just what you did .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 22]: I 'd have done it myself , to make quite sure he would keep away -- because I like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 5]: said Miss Betty again .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 14]: she repeated and reiterated to herself after Mrs. Tanberry had gone to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 21]: She had sunk into a chair in the library with a book , and `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 18]: she whispered as the open unread page blurred before her , `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 24]: He had needed his lesson ; but she had to bear the recollection of how white his face went when he received it .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 44]: Her affront had put about him a strange loneliness : the one figure with the stilled crowd staring ; it had made a picture from which her mind 's eye had been unable to escape , danced she never so hard and late .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 22]: Unconsciously , Robert Carewe 's daughter had avenged the other figure which had stood in lonely humiliation before the staring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 18]: Ah , did they think it was in her to hurt any living thing in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 16]: The book dropped from her lap , and she bowed her head upon her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 9]: -- and tears upon the small lace gauntlets !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 25]: She saw them , and with an incoherent exclamation , half self-pitying , half impatient , ran out to the stars above her garden .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 23]: She was there for perhaps half an hour , and just before she returned to the house she did a singular thing .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 49]: Standing where all was clear to the sky , where she had stood after her talk with the Incroyable , when he had bid her look to the stars , she raised her arms to them again , her face , pale with a great tenderness , uplifted .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 8]: `` You , you , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 6]: `` I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 47]: And yet it was to nothing definite , to no man , nor outline of a man , to no phantom nor dream-lover , that she spoke ; neither to him she had affronted , nor to him who had bidden her look to the stars .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 8]: Nor was it to the stars themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 15]: She returned slowly and thoughtfully to the house , wondering what she had meant .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 20]: A Voice in a Garden Crailey came home the next day with a new poem , but no fish .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 78]: He lounged up the stairs , late in the afternoon , humming cheerfully to himself , and , dropping his rod in a corner of Tom 's office , laid the poem on the desk before his partner , produced a large , newly-replenished flask , opened it , stretched himself comfortably upon a capacious horse-hair sofa , drank a deep draught , chuckled softly , and requested Mr. Vanrevel to set the rhymes to music immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 11]: `` Try it on your instrument , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 25]: `` It 's a simple verse about nothing but stars , and you can work it out in twenty minutes with the guitar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 16]: `` It is broken , '' said Tom , not looking up from his work .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 3]: `` Broken !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 3]: When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 5]: `` Last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 6]: `` Who broke it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 11]: `` It fell from the table in my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 8]: Easily mended , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 12]: `` I think I shall not play it soon again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 13]: Crailey swung his long legs off the sofa and abruptly sat upright .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 6]: `` What 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 4]: he asked gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 49]: Tom pushed his papers away from him , rose and went to the dusty window that looked to the west , where , at the end of the long street , the sun was setting behind the ruin of charred timbers on the bank of the shining river .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 14]: `` It seems that I played once too often , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 5]: Crailey was thoroughly astonished .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 17]: He took a long , affectionate pull at the flask and offered it to his partner .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 27]: `` No , '' said Tom , turning to him with a troubled face , `` and if I were you , I would n't either .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 11]: These fishing trips of yours -- '' `` Fishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 3]: Crailey laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 6]: `` Trips of a poetaster !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 12]: It 's then I write best , and write I will !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 32]: There 's a poem , and a damned good one , too , old preacher , in every gill of whiskey , and I 'm the lad that can extract it !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 23]: what 's better than to be out in the open , all by yourself in the woods , or on the river ?
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 16]: Think of the long nights alone with the glory of heaven and a good demijohn .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 21]: Why , a man 's thoughts are like actors performing in the air and all the crowding stars for audience !
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 25]: You know in your soul you 'd rather have me out there , going it all by myself , than raising thunder over town .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 18]: And you know , too , it does n't tell on me ; it does n't show !
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 23]: You could n't guess , to save your life , how much I 've had to-day , now , could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' returned the other , `` I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 20]: `` Well , well , '' said Crailey , good-naturedly , `` we were n't talking of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 19]: He set down the flask , went to his friend and dropped a hand lightly on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 8]: `` What made you break the guitar ?
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 4]: Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: `` What makes you think I broke it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 5]: asked his partner sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 12]: `` Tell me why you did it , '' said Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 28]: And Tom , pacing the room , told him , while Crailey stood in silence , looking him eagerly in the eye whenever Tom turned his way .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 25]: The listener interrupted seldom ; once it was to exclaim : `` But you have n't said why you broke the guitar ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 12]: ` If thine eye offend thee , pluck it out ! '
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 14]: I ought to have cut off the hands that played to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 11]: `` And cut your throat for singing to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 6]: `` She was right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 11]: the other answered , striding up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 7]: `` Right -- a thousand times !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 5]: in everything she did .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 12]: That I should even ap-proach her , was an unspeakable insolence .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 24]: I had forgotten , and so , possibly , had she , but I had not even been properly introduced to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 17]: `` No , you had n't , that 's true , '' observed Crailey , reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 16]: `` You do n't seem to have much to reproach her with , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 5]: `` Reproach her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 30]: `` That I should dream she would speak to me or have anything to do with me , was to cast a doubt upon her loyalty as a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 7]: She was right , I say !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: And she did the only thing she could do : rebuked me before them all .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 14]: No one ever merited what he got more roundly than I deserved that .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 26]: Who was I , in her eyes , that I should besiege her with my importunities , who but her father 's worst enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 7]: Deep anxiety knitted Crailey 's brow .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 15]: `` I understood she knew of the quarrel , '' he said , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 17]: `` I saw that , the other evening when I helped her out of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 22]: She spoke of it on the way home , I remember ; but how did she know that you were Vanrevel ?
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 14]: No one in town would be apt to mention you to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: `` No , but she did know , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' returned Mr. Gray slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 5]: `` So it seems !
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 26]: Probably her father told her to avoid you , and described you so that she recognized you as the man who caught the kitten . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 39]: He paused , picked up the flask , and again applied himself to its contents , his eyes peering over the up-tilted vessel at Tom , who continued to pace up and down the length of the office .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 38]: After a time , Crailey , fumbling in his coat , found a long cheroot , and , as he lit it , inquired casually : `` Do you remember if she addressed you by name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: `` I think not , '' Tom answered , halting .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 7]: `` What does it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 6]: Crailey drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: `` It does n't , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 19]: `` She knew me well enough , '' said Tom , sadly , as he resumed his sentry-go .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' repeated Crailey , deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 10]: `` So it seems ; so it seems ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 29]: He blew a long stream of smoke out into the air before him , and softly mur-mured again : `` So it seems , so it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 28]: Silence fell , broken only by the sound of Tom 's footsteps , until , presently , some one informally shouted his name from the street below .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 34]: It was only Will Cummings , passing the time of day , but when Tom turned from the window after answering him , Crailey , his poem , and his flask were gone .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 45]: That evening Vanrevel sat in the dusty office , driving himself to his work with a sharp goad , for there was a face that came between him and all else in the world , and a voice that sounded always in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 29]: But the work was done before he rose from his chair , though he showed a haggard visage as he bent above his candles to blow them out .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 52]: It was eleven o'clock ; Crailey had not come back , and Tom knew that his light-hearted friend would not return for many hours ; and so , having no mind to read , and no belief that he could if he tried , he went out to walk the streets .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 39]: He went down to the river first , and stood for a little while gazing at the ruins of the two warehouses , and that was like a man with a headache beating his skull against a wall .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 46]: As he stood on the blackened wharf , he saw how the charred beams rose above him against the sky like a gallows , and it seemed to him that nothing could have been a better symbol , for here he had hanged his self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 5]: `` Reproach her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 11]: He , who had so displayed his imbecility before her !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 58]: Had he been her father 's best friend , he should have had too great a sense of shame to dare to speak to her after that night when her quiet intelligence had exhibited him to himself , and to all the world , as nought else than a fool -- and a noisy one at that !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 57]: Suddenly a shudder convulsed him ; he struck his open palm across his forehead and spoke aloud , while , from horizon to horizon , the night air grew thick with the whispered laughter of observing hobgoblins : `` And even if there had been no stairway , we could have slid down the hose-line ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 39]: He retraced his steps , a tall , gray figure moving slowly through the blue darkness , and his lips formed the heart-sick shadow of a smile when he found that he had unconsciously turned into Carewe Street .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 51]: Presently he came to a gap in a hedge , through which he had sometimes stolen to hear the sound of a harp and a girl 's voice singing ; but he did not enter there tonight , though he paused a moment , his head bowed on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 65]: There came a sound of voices ; they seemed to be moving toward the hedge , toward the gap where he stood ; one a man 's eager , quick , but very musical ; the other , a girl 's , a rich and clear contralto that passed into Tom 's soul like a psalm of rejoicing and like a scimitar of flame .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 64]: He shivered , and moved away quickly , but not before the man 's voice , somewhat louder for the moment , came distinctly from the other side of the hedge : `` After all , '' said the voice , with a ripple of laughter , `` after all , were n't you a little hard on that poor Mr. Gray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 11]: Tom did not understand , but he knew the voice .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 7]: It was that of Crailey Gray .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 14]: He heard the same voice again that night , and again stood unseen .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 75]: Long after midnight he was still tramping the streets on his lonely rounds , when he chanced to pass the Rouen House , which hostelry bore , to the uninitiated eye , the appearance of having closed its doors upon all hospitalities for the night , in strict compliance with the law of the city fathers , yet a slender wand of bright light might be discovered underneath the street door of the bar-room .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 40]: From within the merry retreat issued an uproar of shouting , raucous laughter and the pounding of glasses on tables , heralding all too plainly the hypocrisy of the landlord , and possibly that of the city fathers also .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 49]: Tom knew what company was gathered there : gamblers , truckmen , drunken farmers , men from the river steamers making riot while their boats lay at the wharf , with a motley gathering of good-for-nothings of the back-alleys , and tippling clerks from the Main Street stores .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 60]: There came loud cries for a song , and , in answer , the voice of Crailey rose over the general din , somewhat hoarse , and never so musical when he sang as when he spoke , yet so touching in its dramatic tenderness that soon the noise fell away , and the roisterers sat quietly to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 16]: It was not the first time Ben Jonson 's song had stilled a disreputable company .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 29]: `` I sent thee late a rosy wreath , Not so much honoring thee , As giving it the hope that there It might not withered be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 40]: Perhaps , just then , Vanrevel would have wished to hear him sing anything in the world rather than that , for on Crailey 's lips it carried too much meaning tonight , after the voice in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 31]: And Tom lingered no more near the betraying sliver of light beneath the door than he had by the gap in the hedge , but went steadily on his way .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 27]: Not far from the hotel he passed a small building brightly lighted and echoing with unusual clamors of industry : the office of the Rouen Journal .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 33]: The press was going , and Mr. Cummings 's thin figure crossed and recrossed the windows , while his voice could be heard energetically bidding his assistants to `` Look alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 50]: so that Tom imagined that something might have happened between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande ; but he did not stop to ask the journalist , for he desired to behold the face of none of his friends until he had fought out some things within himself .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 7]: So he strode on toward nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 13]: Day was breaking when Mr. Gray climbed the stairs to his room .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 49]: There were two flights , the ascent of the first of which occupied about half an hour of Crailey 's invaluable time ; and the second might have taken more of it , or possibly consumed the greater part of the morning , had he received no assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 55]: But , as he reclined to meditate upon the first landing , another man entered the hallway from without , ascended quickly , and Crailey became pleasantly conscious that two strong hands had lifted him to his feet ; and , presently , that he was being borne aloft upon the new-comer 's back .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 53]: It seemed quite a journey , yet the motion was soothing , so he made no effort to open his eyes , until he found himself gently deposited upon the couch in his own chamber , when he smiled amiably , and , looking up , discovered his partner standing over him .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 15]: Tom was very pale and there were deep , violet scrawls beneath his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 13]: For once in his life he had come home later than Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 14]: `` First time , you know , '' said Crailey , with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: `` You 'll admit first time completely incapable ?
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 13]: Often needed guiding hand , but never -- quite -- before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' said Tom , quietly , `` it is the first time I ever saw you quite finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: `` Think I must be growing old and constitution refuses bear it .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 11]: Disgraceful to be seen in condition , yet celebration justified .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: H'rah for the news ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 6]: He waved his hand wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 9]: `` Old red , white , and blue !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 8]: American eagle now kindly proceed to scream !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 10]: Starspangled banner intends streaming to all the trade winds !
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 4]: Sea to sea !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 11]: Glorious victories on political thieving exhibition -- no , expedition !
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 15]: Everybody not responsible for the trouble to go and get himself patriotically killed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 4]: `` Water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 6]: said the other , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 38]: Tom brought the pitcher , and Crailey , setting his hot lips to it , drank long and deeply ; then , with his friend 's assistance , he tied a heavily moistened towel round his head .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 32]: `` All right very soon and sober again , '' he muttered , and lay back upon the pillow with eyes tightly closed in an intense effort to concentrate his will .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 24]: When he opened them again , four or five minutes later , they had marvellously cleared and his look was self-contained and sane .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: `` Have n't you heard the news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 7]: He spoke much more easily now .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 10]: `` It came at midnight to the Journal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 12]: `` No ; I 've been walking in the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 22]: `` The Mexicans crossed the Rio Grande on the twenty-sixth of last month , captured Captain Thornton and murdered Colonel Crook .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 7]: That means war is certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 14]: `` It has been certain for a long time , '' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 10]: `` Polk has forced it from the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 20]: `` Then it 's a devil of a pity he ca n't be the only man to die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 8]: `` Have they called for volunteers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 8]: asked Tom , going toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 14]: `` No ; but if the news is true , they will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' said Tom ; and as he reached the hallway he paused .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 9]: `` Can I help you to undress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 5]: `` Certainly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 6]: Crailey sat up , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 11]: `` Ca n't you see that I 'm perfectly sober ?
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 14]: It was the merest temporary fit , and I 've shaken it off .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 6]: Do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 29]: He got upon his feet , staggered , but shook himself like a dog coming out of the water , and came to the door with infirm steps .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 12]: `` You 're going to bed , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 7]: `` You 'd much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 7]: `` No , '' answered Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 4]: `` Are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 7]: I 'm going to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 15]: `` You 've been all up night , too , have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 10]: Crailey put his hand on the other 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 8]: `` Were you hunting for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 8]: `` No ; not last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 15]: Crailey lurched suddenly , and Tom caught him about the waist to steady him .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 15]: `` Sweethearting , tippling , vingt-et-un , or poker , eh , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 10]: he shouted , thickly , with a wild laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 17]: `` Ha , ha , old smug-face , up to my bad tricks at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 24]: But , recovering himself immediately , he pushed the other off at arm 's length , and slapped himself smartly on the brow .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 19]: `` Never mind ; all right , all right -- only a bad wave , now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: A walk will make me more a man than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 12]: `` You 'd much better go to bed , Crailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 12]: I 'm going to change my clothes and go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 52]: Crailey did not answer , but at that moment the Catholic church-bell , summoning the faithful to mass , pealed loudly on the morning air ; and the steady glance of Tom Vanrevel rested upon the reckless eyes of the man beside him as they listened together to its insistent call .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 16]: Tom said , gently , almost timidly : `` You have an -- engagement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 7]: This time the answer came briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 28]: `` Yes ; I promised to take Fanchon to the cemetery before breakfast , to place some flowers on the grave of the little brother who died .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 8]: This happens to be his birthday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 11]: It was Tom who averted his eyes , not Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 56]: `` Then you 'd best hurry , '' he said , hesitatingly ; `` I must n't keep you , '' and went downstairs to his office with flushed cheeks , a hanging head , and an expression which would have led a stranger to believe that he had just been caught in a lie .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 50]: He went to the Main Street window , and seated himself upon the ledge , the only one in the room not too dusty for occupation ; for here , at this hour , Tom had taken his place every morning since Elizabeth Carewe had come from the convent .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 17]: The window was a coign of vantage , commanding the corner of Carewe and Main streets .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 58]: Some distance west of the corner , the Catholic church cast its long shadow across Main Street , and , in order to enter the church , a person who lived upon Carewe Street must pass the corner , or else make a half-mile detour and approach from the other direction -- which the person never did .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 57]: Tom had thought it out the first night that the image of Miss Betty had kept him awake -- and that was the first night Miss Carewe spent in Rouen -- the St. Mary 's girl would be sure to go to mass every day , which was why the window-ledge was dusted the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 98]: The glass doors of the little corner drug-store caught the early sun of the hot May morning and became like sheets of polished brass ; a farmer 's wagon rattled down the dusty street ; a group of Irish waitresses from the hotel made the boardwalk rattle under their hurried steps as they went toward the church , talking busily to one another ; and a blinking youth in his shirt-sleeves , who wore the air of one newly , but not gladly , risen , began to struggle mournfully with the shutters of Madrillon 's bank .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 21]: A moment later , Tom heard Crailey come down the stairs , sure of foot and humming lightly to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 49]: The door of the office was closed ; Crailey did not look in , but presently appeared , smiling , trim , immaculate , all in white linen , on the opposite side of the street , and offered badinage to the boy who toiled at the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 43]: The bell had almost ceased to ring when a lady , dressed plainly in black , but graceful and tall , came rapidly out of Carewe Street , turned at the corner by the little drug-store , and went toward the church .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 19]: The boy was left staring , for Crailey 's banter broke off in the middle of a word .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 14]: He overtook her on the church steps , and they went in together .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 50]: That afternoon Fanchon Bareaud told Tom how beautiful her betrothed had been to her ; he had brought her a great bouquet of violets and lilies-of-the-valley , and had taken her to the cemetery to place them on the grave of her baby brother , whose birthday it was .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 30]: Tears came to Fanchon 's eyes as she spoke of her lover 's goodness , and of how wonderfully he had talked as they stood beside the little grave .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 18]: `` He was the only one who remembered that this was poor tiny Jean 's birthday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 6]: she said , and sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 17]: `` He came just after breakfast and asked me to go out there with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 50]: The Room in the Cupola Mr. Carewe returned , one warm May afternoon , by the six o'clock boat , which was sometimes a day late and sometimes a few hours early ; the latter contingency arising , as in the present instance , when the owner was aboard .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 36]: Nelson drove him from the wharf to the bank , where he conferred briefly , in an undertone , with Eugene Madrillon ; after which Eugene sent a note containing three words to Tappingham Marsh .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 29]: Marsh tore up the note , and sauntered over to the club , where he found General Trumble and Jefferson Bareaud amicably discussing a pitcher of cherry bounce .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 21]: `` He has come , '' said Tappingham , pleased to find the pair the only occupants of the place .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 13]: `` He saw Madrillon , and there 's a session to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 6]: `` Praise the Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 10]: exclaimed the stout General , rising to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 9]: `` I 'll see old Chenoweth at once .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 7]: My fingers have the itch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 10]: `` And mine , too , '' said Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 17]: `` I 'd begun to think we 'd never have a go with him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 8]: `` You must see that Crailey comes .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 6]: We want a full table .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 14]: Drag him , if you ca n't get him any other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 11]: `` He wo n't need urging , '' said Jefferson .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 9]: `` But he cut us last time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 7]: `` He wo n't cut tonight .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 4]: What hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 7]: `` Nine , '' answered Tappingham .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 12]: `` It 's to be a full sitting , remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 11]: `` Do n't fear for us , '' laughed Trumble .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: `` Nor for Crailey , '' Jefferson added .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 29]: `` After so long a vacation you could n't keep him away if you chained him to the court-house pillars ; he 'd tear 'em in two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 11]: `` Here 's to our better fortunes , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 22]: said the old soldier , filling a glass for Tappingham ; and , `` Here 's to our better fortunes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 12]: echoed the young men , pouring off the gentle liquor heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 13]: Having thus made libation to their particular god , the trio separated .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 29]: But Jefferson did not encounter the alacrity of acceptance he expected from Crailey , when he found him , half an hour later , at the hotel bar .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 69]: Indeed , at first , Mr. Gray not only refused outright to go , but seriously urged the same course upon Jefferson ; moreover , his remonstrance was offered in such evident good faith that Bareaud , in the act of swallowing one of his large doses of quinine , paused with only half the powder down his throat , gazing , nonplussed , at his prospective brother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 6]: `` My immortal soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 6]: `` Is this Crailey Gray ?
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 6]: What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 9]: `` Nothing , '' replied Crailey , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 12]: `` Only do n't go , you 've lost enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 10]: `` Well , you 're a beautiful one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 8]: Jefferson exclaimed , with an incredulous laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 16]: `` You 're a master hand ; you , to talk about losing enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 49]: `` I know , I know , '' Crailey began , shaking his head , `` but -- '' `` You 've promised Fanchon never to go again , and you 're afraid Miss Betty will see or hear us , and tell her you were there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 9]: `` I do n't know Miss Carewe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 23]: `` Then you need n't fear ; besides , she 'll be out when we come , and asleep when we go .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 12]: She will never know we 've been in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 52]: `` That has nothing to do with it , '' said Crailey , impatiently ; and he was the more earnest because he remembered the dangerous geography of the Carewe house , which made it impossible for anyone to leave the cupola-room except by the long hall which passed certain doors .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 26]: `` I will not go , and what 's more , I promised Fanchon I 'd try to keep you out of it hereafter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 9]: `` Lord , but we 're virtuous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 5]: laughed the incredulous Jefferson .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 13]: `` I 'll come for you at a quarter to nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 11]: `` I will not go , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 3]: Jefferson roared .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 6]: `` Yes , you will .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 11]: You could n't keep from it if you tried ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 42]: And he took himself off , laughing violently , again promising to call for Crailey on his way to the tryst , and leaving him still warmly protesting that it would be a great folly for either of them to go .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 21]: Crailey looked after the lad 's long , thin figure with an expression as near anger as he ever wore .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 11]: `` He 'll go , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 14]: `` And -- ah , well -- I 'll have to risk it !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 34]: I 'll go with him , but only to try and bring him away early -- that is , as early as it 's safe to be sure that they are asleep downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 6]: And I wo n't play .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 13]: No , I 'll not play ; I 'll not play . ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 15]: He paid his score and went out of the hotel by a side door .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 51]: Some distance up the street , Bareaud was still to be seen , lounging homeward in the pleasant afternoon sunshine , he stopped on a corner and serenely poured another quinine powder into himself and threw the paper to a couple of pigs who looked up from the gutter maliciously .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 5]: `` Confound him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 6]: said Crailey , laughing ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 21]: `` He makes me a missionary -- for I 'll keep my word to Fanchon in that , at least !
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 7]: I 'll look after Jefferson tonight .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: Ah , I might as well be old Tom Vanrevel , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 12]: Meanwhile , Mr. Carewe had taken possession of his own again .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 48]: His daughter ran to the door to meet him ; she was trembling a little , and , blushing and smiling , held out both her hands to him , so that Mrs. Tanberry vowed this was the loveliest creature in the world , and the kindest .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 16]: Mr. Carewe bowed slightly , as to an acquaintance , and disregarded the extended hands .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 31]: At that , the blush faded from Miss Betty 's cheeks ; she trembled no more , and a salutation as icy as her father 's was returned to him .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 39]: He bent his heavy brows upon her , and shot a black glance her way , being , of course , immediately enraged by her reflection of his own manner , but he did not speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 32]: Nor did he once address her during the evening meal , preferring to honor Mrs. Tanberry with his conversation , to that diplomatic lady 's secret anger , but outward amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 54]: She cheerfully neglected to answer him at times , having not the slightest awe of him , and turned to the girl instead ; indeed , she was only prevented from rating him soundly at his own table by the fear that she might make the situation more difficult for her young charge .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 39]: As soon as it was possible , she made her escape with Miss Betty , and they drove away in the twilight to pay visits of duty , leaving Mr. Carewe frowning at his coffee on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 45]: When they came home , three hours later , Miss Betty noticed that a fringe of illumination bordered each of the heavily curtained windows in the cupola , and she uttered an exclamation , for she had never known that room to be lighted .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 33]: she cried , touching Mrs. Tanberry 's arm , as the horses trotted through the gates under a drizzle of rain , `` I thought the room in the cupola was empty .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 24]: It 's always locked , and when I came from St. Mary 's he told me that old furniture was stored there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 8]: Mrs. Tanberry was grateful for the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 18]: `` He may have gone there to read , '' she answered , in a queer voice .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 18]: `` Let us go quietly to bed , child , so as not to disturb him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 32]: Betty had as little desire to disturb her father as she had to see him ; therefore she obeyed her friend 's injunction , and went to her room on tip-toe .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 14]: The house was very silent as she lit the candles on her bureau .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 33]: Outside , the gentle drizzle and the soothing tinkle from the eaves were the only sounds ; within , there was but the faint rustle of garments from Mrs. Tanberry 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 38]: Presently the latter ceased to be heard , and a wooden moan of protest from the four-poster upon which the good lady reposed , announced that she had drawn the curtains and wooed the rulers of Nod .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 28]: Although it was one of those nights of which they say , `` It is a good night to sleep , '' Miss Betty was not drowsy .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 22]: She had half-unfastened one small sandal , but she tied the ribbons again , and seated herself by the open window .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 35]: The ledge and casement framed a dim oblong of thin light from the candles behind her , a lonely lustre , which crossed the veranda to melt shapelessly into darkness on the soggy lawn .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 24]: She felt a melancholy in the softly falling rain and wet , black foliage that chimed with the sadness of her own spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 21]: The night suited her very well , for her father 's coming had brought a weight of depression with it .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 16]: Why could he not have spoken one word to her , even a cross one ?
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 42]: She knew that he did not love her , yet , merely as a fellow-being , she was entitled to a measure of courtesy ; and the fact that she was his daughter could not excuse his failure to render it .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 13]: Was she to continue to live with him on their present terms ?
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 41]: She had no intention to make another effort to alter them ; but to remain as they were would be intolerable , and Mrs. Tanberry could not stay forever , to act as a buffer between her and her father .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 68]: Peering out into the dismal night , she found her own future as black , and it seemed no wonder that the Sisters loved the convent life ; that the pale nuns forsook the world wherein there was so much useless unkindness ; where women were petty and jealous , like that cowardly Fanchon , and men who looked great were tricksters , like Fanchon 's betrothed .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 7]: Miss Betty clenched her delicate fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 11]: She would not remember that white , startled face again !
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 36]: Another face helped her to shut out the recollection : that of the man who had come to mass to meet her yesterday morning , and with whom she had taken a long walk afterward .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 39]: He had shown her a quaint old English gardener who lived on the bank of the river , had bought her a bouquet , and she had helped him to select another to send to a sick friend .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 29]: How beautiful the flowers were , and how happy he had made the morning for her , with his gayety , his lightness , and his odd wisdom !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: Was it only yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 11]: Her father 's coming had made yesterday a fortnight old .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 91]: But the continuously pattering rain and the soft drip-drop from the roof , though as mournful as she chose to find them , began , afterwhile , to weave their somnolent spells , and she slowly drifted from reveries of unhappy sorts , into half-dreams , in which she was still aware she was awake ; yet slumber , heavy-eyed , stirring from the curtains beside her with the small night breeze , breathed strange distortions upon familiar things , and drowsy impossibilities moved upon the surface of her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 21]: Her chin , resting upon her hand , sank gently , until her head almost lay upon her relaxed arms .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 9]: `` That is mine , Crailey Gray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 42]: She sprang to her feet , immeasurably startled , one hand clutching the back of her chair , the other tremulously pressed to her cheek , convinced that her father had stooped over her and shouted the sentence in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 45]: For it was his voice , and the house rang with the words ; all the rooms , halls , and even the walls , seemed still murmurous with the sudden sound , like the tingling of a bell after it had been struck .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 7]: And yet -- everything was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 51]: She pressed her fingers to her forehead , trying to untangle the maze of dreams which had evolved this shock for her , the sudden clamor in her father 's voice of a name she hated and hoped never to hear again , a name she was trying to forget .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 29]: But as she was unable to trace anything which had led to it , there remained only the conclusion that her nerves were not what they should be .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 25]: The vapors having become obsolete for young ladies as an explanation for all unpleasant sensations , they were instructed to have `` nerves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 45]: This was Miss Betty 's first consciousness of her own , and , desiring no greater acquaintance with them , she told herself it was unwholesome to fall asleep in a chair by an open window when the night was as sad as she .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 36]: Turning to a chair in front of the small oval mirror of her bureau , she unclasped the brooch which held her lace collar , and , seating herself , began to unfasten her hair .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 13]: Suddenly she paused , her uplifted arms falling mechanically to her sides .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 24]: Someone was coming through the long hall with a soft , almost inaudible step , a step which was not her father 's .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 15]: She knew at once , with instinctive certainty , that it was not he .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 34]: Nor was it Nelson , who would have shuffled ; nor could it be the vain Mamie , nor one of the other servants , for they did not sleep in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 19]: It was a step more like a woman 's , though certainly it was not Mrs. Tanberry 's .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 38]: Betty rose , took a candle , and stood silent for a moment , the heavy tresses of her hair , half-unloosed , falling upon her neck and left shoulder like the folds of a dark drapery .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 13]: At the slight rustle of her rising , the steps ceased instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 15]: Her heart set up a wild beating and the candle shook in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 45]: But she was brave and young , and , following an irresistible impulse , she ran across the room , flung open the door , and threw the light of the candle into the hall , holding it at arm 's length before her .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 10]: She came almost face to face with Crailey Gray .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 42]: The blood went from his cheeks as a swallow flies down from a roof ; he started back against the opposite wall with a stifled groan , while she stared at him blankly , and grew as deathly pale as he .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 27]: He was a man of great resource in all emergencies which required a quick tongue , but , for the moment , this was beyond him .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 22]: He felt himself lost , toppling backward into an abyss , and the uselessness of his destruction made him physically sick .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 40]: For he need not have been there ; he had not wished to come ; he had well counted the danger to himself , and this one time in his life had gone to the cupola-room out of good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 18]: But Bareaud had been obstinate and Crailey had come away alone , hoping that Jefferson might follow .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 18]: And here he was , poor trapped rat , convicted and ruined because of a good action !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 73]: At last he knew consistency to be a jewel , and that a greedy boy should never give a crust ; that a fool should stick to his folly , a villain to his deviltry , and each hold his own ; for the man who thrusts a good deed into a life of lies is wound about with perilous passes , and in his devious ways a thousand unexpected damnations spring .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 25]: Beaten , stunned , hang-jawed with despair , he returned her long , dumfounded gaze hopelessly and told the truth like an inspired dunce .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 36]: `` I came -- I came -- to bring another man away , '' he whispered brokenly ; and , at the very moment , several heavy , half-suppressed voices broke into eager talk overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 20]: The white hand that held the candle wavered , and the shadows glided in a huge , grotesque dance .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 29]: Twice she essayed to speak before she could do so , at the same moment motioning him back , for he had made a vague gesture toward her .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 6]: `` I am not faint .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 10]: Do you mean , away from up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 6]: She pointed to the cupola-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 8]: `` Have-have you seen my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 60]: The question came out of such a depth of incredulousness that it was more an articulation of the lips than a sound , but he caught it ; and , with it not hope , but the shadow of a shadow of hope , a hand waving from the far shore to the swimmer who has been down twice .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 7]: Did she fear for his sake ?
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 10]: `` No -- I have not seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: He was groping blindly .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 17]: `` You did not come from that '' `` How did you enter the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 23]: The draught through the hall was blowing upon him ; the double doors upon the veranda had been left open for coolness .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: `` There , '' he said , pointing to them .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 13]: `` But -- I heard you come from the other direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 18]: He was breathing quickly ; he saw his chance -- if Jefferson Bareaud did not come now .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 12]: `` You did not hear me come down the stairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 11]: He leaned toward her , risking it all on that .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 10]: A sigh too like a gasp burst from Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 19]: His head lifted a little , and his eyes were luminous with an eagerness that was almost anguish .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 17]: He set his utmost will at work to collect himself and to think hard and fast .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 16]: `` I came here resolved to take a man away , come what would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 19]: `` I found the door open , went to the foot of that stairway ; then I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 18]: I remembered something ; I turned , and was going away when you opened the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 6]: `` You remembered what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 55]: Her strained attitude did not relax , nor , to his utmost scrutiny , was the complete astonishment of her distended gaze altered one whit , but a hint of her accustomed high color was again upon her cheek and her lip trembled a little , like that of a child about to weep .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 25]: The flicker of hope in his breast increased prodigiously , and the rush of it took the breath from his throat and choked him .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 3]: Good God !
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 7]: was she going to believe him ?
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 7]: `` I remembered -- you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 5]: she said , wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 42]: Art returned with a splendid bound , full-pinioned , his beautiful and treacherous Familiar who had deserted him at the crucial instant ; but she made up for it now , folding him in protective wings and breathing through his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 17]: In rapid and vehement whispers he poured out the words upon the girl in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 21]: `` I have a friend , and I would lay down my life to make him what he could be .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 30]: He has always thrown everything away , his life , his talents , all his money and all of mine , for the sake of -- throwing them away !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 16]: Some other must tell you about that room ; but it has ruined my friend .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 23]: Tonight I discovered that he had been summoned here , and I made up my mind to come and take him away .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 20]: Your father has sworn to shoot me if I set foot in his house or on ground of his .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 13]: Well , my duty was clear and I came to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 25]: And yet -- I stopped at the foot of the stair -- because -- because I remembered that you were Robert Carewe 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 17]: What of you , if I went up and harm came to me from your father ?
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 10]: For I swear I would not have touched him !
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 69]: You asked me not to speak of ` personal ' things , and I have obeyed you ; but you see I must tell you one thing now : I have cared for this friend of mine more than for all else under heaven , but I turned and left him to his ruin , and would a thousand times , rather than bring trouble upon you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 5]: A thousand times ? '
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 12]: I swear it should be a thousand times a thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 31]: He had paraded in one speech from the prisoner 's dock to Capulet 's garden , and her eyes were shining into his like a great light when he finished .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 8]: `` Go quickly , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 4]: `` Go quickly !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 4]: Go quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 7]: `` But do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 8]: `` Not yet , but I shall .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 4]: Will you go ?
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 10]: They might come-my father might come-at any moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 14]: `` But -- '' `` Do you want to drive me quite mad ?
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 4]: Please go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 11]: She laid a trembling , urgent hand upon his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 25]: `` Never , until you tell me that you understand , '' replied Crailey firmly , listening keenly for the slightest sound from overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 7]: `` Never -- until then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 19]: `` When I do I shall tell you ; now I only know that you must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 12]: `` But tell me -- '' `` You must go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 15]: There was a shuffling of chairs on the floor overhead , and Crailey went .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 20]: He went even more hastily than might have been expected from the adaman-tine attitude he had just previously assumed .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 23]: Realizing this as he reached the wet path , he risked stealing round to her window : `` For your sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 39]: he breathed ; and having thus forestalled any trifling imperfection which might arise in her recollection of his exit from the house , he disappeared , kissing his hand to the rain as he ran down the street .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 14]: Miss Betty locked her door and pulled close the curtains of her window .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 22]: A numerous but careful sound of footsteps came from the hall , went by her door and out across the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 14]: Silently she waited until she heard her father go alone to his room .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 11]: She took the candle and went in to Mrs. Tanberry .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 29]: She set the light upon a table , pulled a chair close to the bedside , and placed her cool hand lightly on the great lady 's forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 9]: `` Is n't it very late , child ?
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 7]: Why are you not asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 19]: `` Mrs. Tanberry , I want to know why there was a light in the cupola-room tonight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 15]: Mrs. Tanberry rolled herself as upright as possible , and sat with blinking eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 23]: `` I want to know what I am sure you know , and what I am sure everybody knows , except me .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 27]: What were they doing there tonight , and what was the quarrel between Mr. Vanrevel and my father that had to do with Mr. Gray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 10]: Mrs. Tanberry gazed earnestly into the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 23]: After a long time she said in a gentle voice : `` Child , has it come to matter that much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Miss Betty .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 45]: The Tocsin Tom Vanrevel always went to the post-office soon after the morning distribution of the mail ; that is to say , about ten o'clock , and returned with the letters for the firm of Gray and Vanrevel , both personal and official .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 43]: Crailey and he shared everything , even a box at the post-office ; and in front of this box , one morning , after a night of rain , Tom stood staring at a white envelope bearing a small , black seal .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 29]: The address was in a writing he had never seen before , but the instant it fell under his eye he was struck with a distinctly pleasurable excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 63]: Whether through some spiritual exhalation of the writer fragrant on any missive , or because of a hundred microscopic impressions , there are analysts who are able to select , from a pile of letters written by women -LRB- for the writing of women exhibits certain phenomena more determinably than that of men -RRB- those of the prettiest or otherwise most attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 32]: And out upon the lover who does not recognize his mistress 's hand at the first glimpse ever he has of it , without post-mark or other information to aid him !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 58]: Thus Vanrevel , worn , hollow-eyed , and sallow , in the Rouen post-office , held the one letter separate from a dozen -LRB- the latter not , indeed , from women -RRB- , and stared at it until a little color came back to his dark skin and a great deal of brightness to his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 22]: He was no analyst of handwritings , yet it came to him instantly that this note was from a pretty woman .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 31]: To see that it was from a woman was simple , but that he knew -- and he did know -- that she was pretty , savors of the occult .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 13]: More than this : there was something about it that thrilled him .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 15]: Suddenly , and without reason , he knew that it came from Elizabeth Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 44]: He walked back quickly to his office with the letter in the left pocket of his coat , threw the bundle of general correspondence upon his desk , went up to the floor above , and paused at his own door to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 62]: Deep breathing from across the hall indicated that Mr. Gray 's soul was still encased in slumber , and great was its need , as Tom had found his partner , that morning at five , stretched upon the horsehair sofa in the office , lamenting the emptiness of a bottle which had been filled with fiery Bourbon in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 19]: Vanrevel went to his own room , locked the door , and took the letter from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 43]: He held it between his fingers carefully , as though it were alive and very fragile , and he looked at it a long time , holding it first in one hand , then in the other , before he opened it .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 48]: At last , however , after examining all the blades of his pocketknife , he selected one brighter than the others , and loosened the flap of the envelope as gently and carefully as if it had been the petal of a rose-bud that he was opening .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 18]: `` Dear Mr. Vanrevel : `` I believed you last night , though I did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 40]: But I understand , now -- everything -- and , bitter to me as the truth is , I must show you plainly that I know all of it , nor can I rest until I do show you .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 40]: I want you to answer this letter -- though I must not see you again for a long time -- and in your answer you must set me right if I am anywhere mistaken in what I have learned .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 30]: `` At first , and until after the second time we met , I did not believe in your heart , though I did in your mind and humor .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 33]: Even since then , there have come strange , small , inexplicable mistrustings of you , but now I throw them all away and trust you wholly , Monsieur Citizen Georges Meilbac !
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 30]: -- I shall always think of you in those impossible garnishments of my poor great-uncle , and I persuade myself that he must have been a little like you .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 15]: `` I trust you because I have heard the story of your profound goodness .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 20]: The first reason for my father 's dislike was your belief in freedom as the right of all men .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 17]: Ah , it is not your pretty exaggerations and flatteries -LRB- I laugh at them ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 19]: that speak for you , but your career , itself , and the brave things you have done .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 31]: My father 's dislike flared into hatred because you worsted him when he discovered that he could not successfully defend the wrong against you and fell back upon sheer insult .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 20]: `` He is a man whom I do not know -- strange as that seems as I write it .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 19]: It is only to you , who have taught me so much , that I could write it .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 37]: I have tried to know him and to realize that I am his daughter , but we are the coldest acquaintances , that is all ; and I can not see how a change could come .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 18]: I do not understand him ; least of all do I understand why he is a gambler .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 31]: It has been explained to me that it is his great passion , but all I comprehend in these words is that they are full of shame for his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 52]: `` This is what was told me : he has always played heavily and skillfully -- adding much to his estate in that way -- and in Rouen always with a certain coterie , which was joined , several years ago , by the man you came to save last night .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 16]: `` Your devotion to Mr. Gray has been the most beautiful thing in your life .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 30]: I know all that the town knows of that , except the thousand hidden sacrifices you have made for him , those things which no one will ever know .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 14]: -LRB- And yet , you see , I know them after all ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 17]: For your sake , because you love him , I will not even call him unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 48]: `` I have heard -- from one who told unwillingly -- the story of the night two years ago , when the play ran so terribly high ; and how , in the morning when they went away , all were poorer except one , their host !
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 97]: -- how Mr. Gray had nothing left in the world , and owed my father a great sum which was to be paid in twenty-four hours ; how you took everything you had saved in the years of hard work at your profession , and borrowed the rest on your word , and brought it to my father that afternoon ; how , when you had paid your friend 's debt , you asked my father not to play with Mr. Gray again ; and my father made that his excuse to send you a challenge .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 15]: You laughed at the challenge -- and you could afford to laugh at it .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 14]: `` But this is all shame , shame for Robert Carewe 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 33]: It seems to me that I should hide and not lift my head ; that I , being of my father 's blood , could never look you in the face again .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 8]: It is so unspeakably painful and ugly .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 30]: I think of my father 's stiff pride and his look of the eagle , -- and he still plays with your friend , almost always ` successfully ! '
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 8]: And your friend still comes to play !
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 12]: -- but I will not speak of that side of it .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 33]: `` Mr. Gray has made you poor , but I know it was not that which made you come seeking him last night , when I found you there in the hail .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 15]: It was for his sake you came -- and you went away for mine .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 32]: Now that I know , at last -- now that I have heard what your life has been -LRB- and oh I heard so much more than I have written ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 47]: -- now that my eyes have been opened to see you as you are , I am proud , and glad and humble that I can believe that you felt a friendship for me strong enough to have made you go ` for my sake . '
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 12]: You will write to me just once , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 23]: and tell me if there was any error in what I listened to ; but you must not come to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 14]: Now that I know you , I can not meet you clandestinely again .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 23]: It would hurt the dignity which I feel in you now , and my own poor dignity -- such as it is !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 11]: I have been earnestly warned of the danger to you .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 9]: Besides , you must let me test myself .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 9]: I am all fluttering and frightened and excited .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 9]: You will obey me , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 10]: -- do not come until I send for you .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 4]: Elizabeth Carewe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 33]: Mr. Gray , occupied with his toilet about noon , heard his partner descending to the office with a heavy step , and issued from his room to call a hearty greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 35]: Tom looked back over his shoulder and replied cheerily , though with a certain embarrassment ; but Crailey , catching sight of his face , uttered a sharp ejaculation and came down to him .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 10]: `` Why , what 's the matter , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 8]: You 're not going to be sick ?
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: You look like the devil and all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: `` I 'm all right , never fear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: Tom laughed , evading the other 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 38]: `` I 'm going out in the country on some business , and I dare say I shall not be back for a couple of days ; it will be all up and down the county . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 16]: He set down a travelling-bag he was carrying , and offered the other his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 4]: `` Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 8]: `` Ca n't I go for you ?
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 7]: You do n't look able . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 12]: It 's something I 'll have to attend to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 29]: `` Ah , I suppose , '' said Crailey , gently , `` I suppose it 's important , and you could n't trust me to handle it .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 8]: Well -- God knows you 're right !
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 18]: I 've shown you often enough how incompetent I am to do anything but write jingles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 14]: `` You do some more of them -- without the whiskey , Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 19]: They 're worth more than all the lawing Gray and Vanrevel have ever done or ever will do .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 9]: Good-by -- and be kind to yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 32]: He descended to the first landing , and then , `` Oh , Crailey , '' he called , with the air of having forgotten something he had meant to say .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 6]: `` Yes , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 14]: `` This morning at the post-office I found a letter addressed to me .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 28]: I opened it and -- '' He hesitated , and uneasily shifted his weight from one foot to the other , with a feeble , deprecatory laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 8]: `` Yes , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: `` Well -- there seemed to be a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 10]: I think it must have been meant for you .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 38]: Somehow , she -- she 's picked up a good many wrong impressions , and , Lord knows how , but she 's mixed our names up and -- and I 've left the letter for you .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 7]: It 's on my table . ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 25]: He turned and calling a final good-by over his shoulder , went clattering noisily down to the street and vanished from Crailey 's sight .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 81]: Noon found Tom far out on the National Road , creaking along over the yellow dust in a light wagon , between bordering forests that smelt spicily of wet underbrush and May-apples ; and , here and there , when they would emerge from the woods to cleared fields , liberally outlined by long snake-fences of black walnut , the steady , jog-trotting old horse lifted his head and looked interested in the world , but Tom never did either .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 36]: Habitually upright , walking or sitting , straight , keen , and alert , that day 's sun saw him drearily hunched over , mile after mile , his forehead laced with lines of pain .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 42]: He stopped at every farm-house and cabin , and , where the young men worked in the fields , hailed them from the road , or hitched his horse to the fence and crossed the soft furrows to talk with them .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 16]: At such times he stood erect again , and spoke stirringly , finding eager listeners .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 22]: There was one question they asked him over and over : `` But are you sure the call will come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 19]: `` As sure as that we stand here ; and it will come before the week is out .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 6]: We must be ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 62]: Often , when he left them , they would turn from the work in hand , leaving it as it was , to lie unfinished in the fields , and make their way slowly and thoughtfully to their homes , while Tom climbed into his creaking little wagon once more , only to fall into the same dull , hunched-over attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 27]: He had many things to think out before he faced Rouen and Crailey Gray again , and more to fight through to the end with himself .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 50]: Three days he took for it , three days driving through the soft May weather behind the kind , old jog-trotting horse ; three days on the road , from farm-house to farm-house and from field to field , from cabin of the woods to cabin in the clearing .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 75]: Tossing unhappily at night , he lay sleepless till dawn , though not because of the hard beds ; and when daylight came , journeyed steadily on again , over the vagabond little hills that had gypsied it so far into the prairie-land in their wanderings from their range on the Ohio , and , passing the hills , went on through the flat forest-land , always hunched over dismally in the creaking wagon .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 28]: But on the evening of the third day he drove into town , with the stoop out of his shoulders and the lustre back in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 31]: He was haggard , gray , dusty , but he had solved his puzzle , and one thing was clear in his mind as the thing that he would do .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 38]: He patted the old horse a hearty farewell as he left him with the liveryman from whom he had hired him , and strode up Main Street with the air of a man who is going somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 21]: It was late , but there were more lights than usual in the windows and more people on the streets .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 38]: Boys ran shouting , while , here and there , knots of men argued loudly , and in front of the little corner drug-store a noisily talkative , widely gesticulative crowd of fifty or more had gathered .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 75]: An old man , a cobbler , who had left a leg at Tippecanoe and replaced it with a wooden one , chastely decorated with designs of his own carving , came stumping excitedly down the middle of the street , where he walked for fear of the cracks in the wooden pavement , which were dangerous to his art-leg when he came from the Rouen House bar , as on the present occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 6]: He hailed Tom by name .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 13]: `` You 're the lad , Tom Vanrevel , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 17]: `` You 're the man to lead the boys out for the glory of the State !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 14]: You git the whole blame Fire De-partment out and enlist 'em before morning !
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 12]: Take 'em down to the Rio Grande , you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 22]: `` And you need n't be afraid of their puttin ' it out , if it ketches afire , neither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 55]: Tom waved his hand and passed on ; but at the open doors of the Catholic Church he stopped and looked up and down the street , and then , unnoticed , entered to the dim interior , where the few candles showed only a bent old woman in black kneeling at the altar .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 35]: Tom knew where Elizabeth Carewe knelt each morning ; he stepped softly through the shadowy silence to her place , knelt , and rested his head upon the rail of the bench before him .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 37]: The figure at the altar raised itself after a time , and the old woman limped slowly up a side aisle , mumbling her formulas , courtesying to the painted saints , on her way out .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 33]: The very thinnest lingerings of incense hung on the air , seeming to Tom like the faint odor that might exhale from a heavy wreath of marguerites , worn in dark-brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 11]: Yet , the place held nothing but peace and good-will .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 10]: And he found nothing else in his own heart .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 26]: The street was quiet when he emerged from that lorn vigil ; the corner groups had dissolved ; shouting youths no longer patrolled the sidewalks .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 37]: Only one quarter showed signs of life : the little clubhouse , where the windows still shown brightly , and whence came the sound of many voices settling the destinies of the United States of America .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 14]: Thither Tom bent his steps , thoughtfully , and with a quiet mind .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 26]: There was a small veranda at the side of the house ; here he stood unobserved to look in upon his noisy and agitated friends .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 26]: They were all there , from the old General and Mr. Bareaud , to the latter 's son , Jefferson , and young Frank Chenoweth .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 42]: They were gathered about a big table upon which stood a punch-bowl and Trumble , his brow as angry red as the liquor in the cup he held , was proposing a health to the President in a voice of fury .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 16]: `` In spite of all the Crailey Grays and traitors this side of hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 4]: he finished politely .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 27]: Crailey emerged instantaneously from the general throng and mounted a chair , tossing his light hair back from his forehead , his eyes sparkling and happy .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 19]: `` You find your own friends already occupying the place you mentioned , do you , General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: General Trumble stamped and shook his fist .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 10]: `` You 're a spawn of Aaron Burr ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 3]: he vociferated .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 14]: `` There 's not a man here to stand by your infernal doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 20]: You sneer at your own State , you sneer at your own country , you defile the sacred ground !
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 22]: What are you , by the Almighty , who attack your native land in this , her hour of peril ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 8]: `` Peril to my native land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 3]: laughed Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 6]: `` From Santa Anna ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 26]: `` The General 's right , sir , '' exclaimed the elder Chenoweth indignantly , and most of the listeners appeared to agree with him .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 26]: `` It 's a poor time to abuse the President when he 's called for volunteers and our country is in danger , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 7]: `` Who is in danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 15]: answered Crailey , lifting his hand to still the clamor of approbation that arose .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 6]: `` Is Polk in danger ?
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 3]: Or Congress ?
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 9]: But that would be too much to hope !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 10]: Do you expect to see the Greasers in Washington ?
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 9]: No , you idiots , you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 75]: Yet there 'll be plenty of men to suffer and die ; and the first should be those who thrust this war on us and poor little Mexico ; but it wo n't be they ; the men who 'll do the fighting and dying will be the country boys and the like of us from the towns , while Mr. Polk sits planning at the White House how he can get elected again .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 9]: I wish Tom were here , confound you !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 20]: You listen to him because he always has the facts and I 'm just an embroiderer , you think .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 21]: What 's become of the gaudy campaign cry you were all wearing your lungs out with a few months ago ?
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 6]: ` Fifty-four-forty or fight ! '
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 2]: Bah !
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 12]: Polk twisted the lion 's tail with that until after election .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 32]: Then he saw he had to make you forget it , or fight England and be ruined , so he forces war on Mexico , and the country does forget it .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 36]: That 's it : he asks three regiments of volunteers from this State to die of fevers and get shot , so that he can steal another country and make his own elect him again .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 30]: And you ask me to drink the health of the politician who sits at home and sends his fellowmen to die to fix his rotten jobs for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 45]: Crailey had persuaded himself into such earnestness , that the depth of his own feeling almost choked him , but he finished roundly in his beautiful , strong voice : `` I 'll drink for the good punch 's sake -- but that health ?
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 15]: -- I 'll see General Trumble in heaven before I 'll drink it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 37]: There rose at once a roar of anger and disapproval , and Crailey became a mere storm centre amid the upraised hands gestulating madly at him as he stood , smiling again , upon his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 10]: `` This comes of living with Tom Vanrevel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 5]: shouted the General furiously .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 8]: `` This is his damned Abolition teaching !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 17]: You 're only his echo ; you spend half your life playing at being Vanrevel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 6]: `` Where is Vanrevel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 4]: said Tappingham Marsh .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 8]: `` Ay , where is he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: raged Trumble , hammering the table till the glasses rang .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 27]: `` Let him come and answer for his own teaching ; it 's wasted time to talk to this one ; he 's only the pupil .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 6]: Where is the traitor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 28]: `` Here , '' answered a voice from the doorway ; and though the word was spoken quietly it was nevertheless , at that juncture , silencing .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 9]: Everyone turned toward the door as Vanrevel entered .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 24]: But the apoplectic General , whom Crailey 's speech had stirred to a fury beyond control , almost leaped at Tom 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: `` Here 's the tea-sipping old Granny , '' he bellowed hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 10]: -LRB- He was ordinarily very fond of Tom . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 6]: `` Here 's the master !
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 16]: Here 's the man whose example teaches Crailey Gray to throw mud at the flag .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 28]: He 'll stay here at home with Crailey , of course , and throw more , while the others boys march out to die under it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 58]: `` On the contrary , '' answered Tom , raising his voice , `` I think you 'll find Crailey Gray the first to enlist , and as for myself , I 've raised sixty men in the country , and I want forty more from Rouen , in order to offer the Governor a full company .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 69]: So it 's come to ` the King , not the man ' ; Polk is a pitiful trickster , but the country needs her sons ; that 's enough for us to know ; and while I wo n't drink to James Polk '' -- he plunged a cup in the bowl and drew it out brimming -- `` I 'll empty this to the President ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 32]: It was then that from fifty throats the long , wild shout went up that stirred Rouen , and woke the people from their midnight beds for half a mile around .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 22]: The Firm of Gray and Vanrevel For the first time it was Crailey who sat waiting for Tom to come home .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 29]: In a chair drawn to his partner 's desk in the dusty office , he half-reclined , arms on the desk , his chin on his clenched fists .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 95]: To redeem the gloom he had lit a single candle , which painted him dimly against the complete darkness of his own shadow , like a very old portrait whose background time has solidified into shapeless browns ; the portrait of a fair-haired gentleman , the cavalier , or the Marquis , one might have said at first glance ; not describing it immediately as that of a poet , for there was no mark of art upon Crailey , not even in his hair , for they all wore it rather long then .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 42]: Yet there was a mark upon him , never more vivid than as he sat waiting in the loneliness of that night for Tom Vanrevel ; though what the mark was and what its significance might have been puzzling to define .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 36]: Perhaps , after all , Fanchon Bareaud had described it best when she told Crailey one day , with a sudden hint of apprehensive tears , that he had a `` look of fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 33]: Tom took his own time in coming ; he had stayed at the club to go over his lists -- so he had told Crailey -- with the General and old Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 32]: His company was almost complete , and Crailey had been the first to volunteer , to the dumfounding of Trumble , who had proceeded to drink his health again and again .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 50]: But the lists could not detain Tom two hours , Crailey knew , and it was two hours since the new volunteers had sung `` The Star Spangled Banner '' over the last of the punch , and had left the club to Tom and the two old men .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 24]: Only once or twice in that time had Crailey shifted his position , or altered the direction of his set gaze at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 25]: But at last he rose , went to the window and , leaning far out , looked down the street toward the little clubhouse .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 14]: Its lights were extinguished and all was dark up and down the street .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 24]: Abruptly Crailey went back to the desk and blew out the candle , after which he sat down again in the same position .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 17]: Twenty minutes later he heard Tom 's step on the stair , coming up very softly .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 16]: Crailey waited in silence until his partner reached the landing , then relit the candle .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 7]: `` Tom , '' he called .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 14]: `` Come in , please , I 've been waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 19]: There was a pause before Tom answered from the hall : `` I 'm very tired , Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 10]: I think I 'll go up to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 12]: `` No , '' said Crailey , `` come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 13]: The door was already open , but Tom turned toward it reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 13]: He stopped at the threshold and the two looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 28]: `` I thought you would n't come as long as you believed I was up , '' said Crailey , `` so I blew out the light .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 11]: I 'm sorry I kept you outside so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 14]: `` Crailey , I 'm going away to-morrow , '' the other began .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 47]: `` I am to go over and see the Governor and offer him this company , and to-night I need sleep , so please -- '' `` No , '' interrupted Crailey quietly , `` I want to know what you 're going to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: `` To do about what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 5]: `` About me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 17]: Tom 's eyes fell at once from his friend 's face and rested upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 23]: Slowly he walked to the desk and stood in embarrassed contemplation of the littered books and papers , while the other waited .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 16]: `` I think it 's best for you to tell me , '' said Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 6]: `` You think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 54]: Tom 's embarrassment increased visibly , and there was mingled with it an odd appearance of apprehension , probably to relieve which he very deliberately took two long cheroots from his pocket , laid one on the desk for Crailey and lit the other himself , with extreme carefulness , at the candle .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 48]: After this ceremonial he dragged a chair to the window , tilted back in it with his feet on the low sill , his back to the thin light and his friend , and said in a slow , gentle tone : `` Well , Crailey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 22]: `` I suppose you mean that I ought to offer my explanation first , '' said the other , still standing .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 9]: `` Well , there is n't any . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 33]: He did not speak doggedly or sullenly , as one in fault , but more with the air of a man curiously ready to throw all possible light upon a cloudy phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 13]: `` It 's very simple -- all that I know about it .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 33]: I went there first on the evening of the Madrillon masquerade and played a little comedy for her , so that some of my theatrical allusions -- they were n't very illuminating !
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 24]: -- to my engagement to Fanchon , made her believe I was Vanrevel when her father told her about the pair of us .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 50]: I discovered that the night his warehouses burned -- and I saw something more , because I ca n't help seeing such things : that yours was just the character to appeal to a young girl fresh from the convent and full of honesty and fine dreams and fire .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 22]: Nobody could arrange a more fatal fascination for a girl of nineteen than to have a deadly quarrel with her father .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 18]: And that 's especially true when the father 's like that mad brute of a Bob Carewe !
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 32]: Then , too , you 're more or less the town model of virtue and popular hero , in spite of the Abolitionism , just as I am the town scamp .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 27]: So I let it go on , and played a little at being you , saying the things that you only think -- that was all .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: It is n't strange that it 's lasted until now , not more than three weeks , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 16]: She 's only seen you four or five times , and me not much oftener .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 20]: No one speaks of you to her , and I 've kept out of sight when others were about .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 52]: Mrs. Tanberry is her only close friend , and , naturally , would n't be apt to mention that you are dark and I am fair , or to describe us personally , any more than you and I would mention the general appearance of people we both meet about town .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 14]: But you need n't tell me that it ca n't last much longer .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 12]: Some petty , unexpected trifle will turn up , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 14]: All that I want to know is what you mean to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 5]: `` To do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 16]: repeated Tom softly , and blew a long scarf of smoke out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 8]: Crailey 's voice grew sharp and loud .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 11]: `` There are many things you need n't tell me !
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 19]: You need not tell me what I 've done to you -- nor what you think of me !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 21]: You need not tell me that you have others to consider , that you have Miss Carewe to think of .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 8]: Do n't you suppose I know that ?
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 29]: And you need not tell me that you have a duty to Fanchon -- '' `` Yes , '' Tom broke in , his tone not quite steady .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 10]: `` Yes , I 've thought of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 16]: `` Have you -- did you -- '' he hesitated , but Crailey understood immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 11]: `` No ; I have n't seen her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 11]: `` But you -- '' `` Yes -- I wrote .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 6]: I answered the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 12]: `` As - '' `` Yes ; I signed your name .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 24]: I told you that I had just let things go on , '' Crailey answered , with an impatient movement of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 9]: `` What are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 13]: `` I 'm going over to see the Governor in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 13]: I 'll be away two or three days , I imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 4]: `` Vanrevel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 20]: exclaimed Crailey hotly , `` Will you give me an answer and not beat about the bush any longer ?
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 11]: Or do you mean that you refuse to answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 13]: Tom dropped his cigar upon the brick window-ledge with an abysmal sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 69]: `` Oh , no , it is n't that , '' he answered mildly `` I 've been thinking it all over for three days in the country , and when I got back tonight I found that I had come to a decision without knowing it , and that I had come to it even before I started ; my leaving the letter for you proved it .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 18]: It 's a little like this Mexican war , a mixed-up problem and only one thing clear .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 30]: A few schemers have led the country into it to increase the slave-power and make us forget that we threatened England when we could n't carry out the threat .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 21]: And yet , if you look at it broadly , these are the smaller things and they do not last .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 36]: The means by which the country grows may be wrong , but its growth is right ; it is only destiny , working out through lies and blood , but the end will be good .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 12]: It is bound to happen and you ca n't stop it .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 41]: I believe the men who make this war for their own uses will suffer in hell-fire for it ; but it is made , and there 's only one thing I can see as the thing for me to do .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 59]: They 've called me every name on earth -- and the same with you , too , Crailey -- because I 'm an Abolitionist , but now , whether the country has sinned or not , a good many thousand men have got to do the bleeding for her , and I want to be one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 12]: That 's the one thing that is plain to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' returned Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 16]: `` You know I 'm with you ; and I think you 're always right .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 15]: Yes ; we 'll all be on the way in a fortnight or so .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 13]: Do you mean you wo n't quarrel with me because of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 24]: Do you mean it would be a poor time now , when we 're all going out to take our chances together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 6]: `` Quarrel with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 15]: Tom rose and came to the desk , looking across it at his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 10]: `` Did you think I might do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 8]: `` Yes -- I thought so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 4]: `` Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 37]: And now Tom 's expression showed desperation ; it was that of a man whose apprehensions have culminated and who is forced to face a crisis long expected , long averted , but imminent at last .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 19]: His eyes fell from Crailey 's clear gaze and his hand fidgeted among the papers on the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 13]: `` No , '' he began with a painful lameness and hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 46]: `` I did not mean it -- no ; I meant , that , in the same way , only one thing in this other -- this other affair that seems so confused and is such a problem -- only one thing has grown clear .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 73]: It does n't seem to me that -- that -- '' here he drew a deep breath , before he went on with increasing nervousness -- `` that if you like a man and have lived with him a good many years ; that is to say , if you 're really much of a friend to him , I do n't believe you sit on a high seat and judge him .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: Judging , and all that , have n't much part in it .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 19]: And it seems to me that you 've got yourself into a pretty bad mix-up , Crailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 7]: `` It 's pretty bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 28]: `` Well , '' Tom looked up now , with an almost tremulous smile , `` I believe that is about all I can make of it .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 15]: Do you think it 's the part of your best friend to expose you ?
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 24]: It seems to me that if there ever was a time when I ought to stand by you , it 's now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 18]: There was a silence while they looked at each other across the desk in the faint light .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 11]: Tom 's eye fell again as Crailey opened his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 22]: `` And in spite of everything , '' Crailey said breathlessly , `` you mean that you wo n't tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 8]: `` How could I , Crailey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 8]: said Tom Vanrevel as he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 30]: When June Came `` Methought I met a Damsel Fair And tears were in her eyes ; Her head and arms were bare , I heard her bursting sighs .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 18]: `` I stopp 'd and looked her in the face , 'T was then she sweetly smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 14]: Her features shone with mournful grace , Far more than Nature 's child .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 89]: `` With diffident and downcast eye , In modest tones she spoke ; She wiped a tear and gave a sigh , And then her silence broke -- '' So sang Mrs. Tanberry at the piano , relieving the melancholy which possessed her ; but Nelson , pausing in the hail to listen , and exceedingly curious concerning the promised utterance of the Damsel Fair , was to suffer disappointment , as the ballad was broken off abruptly and the songstress closed the piano with a monstrous clatter .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 34]: Little doubt may be entertained that the noise was designed to disturb Mr. Carewe , who sat upon the veranda consulting a brown Principe , and less that the intended insult was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 39]: For an expression of a vindictive nature was precipitated in that quarter so simultaneously that the bang of the piano-lid and the curse were even as the report of a musket and the immediate cry of the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 16]: Mrs. Tanberry at once debouched upon the piazza , showing a vast , clouded countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 13]: `` And I hope to heaven you already had a headache ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 34]: `` The courtesy of your wish , madam , '' Carewe replied , with an angry flash of his eye , `` is only equaled by the kindness of heaven in answering it .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 9]: I have , in fact , a headache .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 7]: I always have , nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 12]: `` That 's good news , '' returned the lady heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 10]: `` I thank you , '' retorted her host .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 23]: `` Perhaps if you treated your daughter even a decent Indian 's kind of politeness , you 'd enjoy better health . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 17]: And in what failure to perform my duty toward her have I incurred your displeasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 7]: `` Where is she now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 5]: exclaimed the other excitably .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 7]: `` Where is she now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 7]: `` I can not say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 10]: `` Yes , you can , Robert Carewe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 9]: Mrs. Tanberry retorted , with a wrathful gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 32]: `` You know well enough she 's in her own room , and so do I -- for I tried to get in to comfort her when I heard her crying .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 15]: She 's in there with the door bolted , where you drove her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 6]: `` I drove her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 3]: he sneered .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 11]: `` Yes , you did , and I heard you .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 18]: Do you think I could n't hear you raging and storming at her like a crazy man ?
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 22]: When you get in a temper do you dream there 's a soul in the neighborhood who does n't know it ?
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 25]: You 're a fool if you do , because they could have heard you swearing down on Main Street , if they 'd listened .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 9]: What are you trying to do to her ?
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 5]: -- break her spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 4]: -- or what ?
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 10]: Because you 'll do it , or kill her .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 9]: I never heard anybody cry so heart-brokenly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 9]: Here the good woman 's own eyes filled .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 9]: `` What 's the use of pretending ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 5]: she went on sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 13]: `` You have n't spoken to her kindly since you came home .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: Do you suppose I 'm blind to that ?
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 25]: You were n't a bad husband to the poor child 's mother ; why ca n't you be a good father to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 17]: `` Perhaps you might begin by asking her to be a good daughter to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 7]: `` What has she done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 21]: `` The night before I went away she ran to a fire and behaved there like a common street hoyden .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 17]: The ladies of the Carewe family have not formerly acquired a notoriety of that kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 4]: `` Bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 4]: said Mrs. Tanberry .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 20]: `` The next morning , when I taxed her with it , she dutifully defied and insulted me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 14]: `` I can imagine the delicacy with which you ` taxed ' her .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 17]: What has that to do with your devilish tantrums of this afternoon , Robert Carewe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 14]: `` I am obliged to you for the expression , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 17]: `` When I came home , this afternoon , I found her reading that thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 23]: He pointed to many very small fragments of Mr. Cummings 's newspaper , which were scattered about the lawn near the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 33]: `` She was out here , reading an article which I had read downtown and which appeared in a special edition of that rotten sheet , sent out two hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 19]: `` Do you know what that article was , madam , do you know what it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 53]: Although breathing heavily , Mr. Carewe had compelled himself to a certain outward calmness , but now , in the uncontrollable agitation of his anger , he sprang to his feet and struck one of the wooden pillars of the porch a shocking blow with the bare knuckles of his clenched hand .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: `` Do you know what it was ?
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 9]: It was a eulogy of that damned Vanrevel !
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 27]: It pretended to be an account of the enrollment of his infernal company , but it was nothing more than a glorification of that nigger-loving hound !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 32]: His company -- a lot of sneaks , who 'll run like sheep from the first Greaser -- elected him captain yesterday , and today he received an appointment as major !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 12]: It dries the blood in my veins to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 7]: -- that black dog a major !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 3]: Good God !
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 10]: am I never to hear the last of him ?
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 23]: Cummings wrote it , the fool , the lying , fawning , slobbering fool ; he ought to be shot for it !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 11]: Neither he nor his paper ever enter my doors again !
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 39]: And I took the dirty sheet from her hands and tore it to pieces -- '' `` Yes , '' interposed Mrs. Tanberry , `` it looks as if you had done it with your teeth . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: -- And stamped it into the ground ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 8]: `` Oh , I heard you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 23]: Carewe came close to her , and gave her a long look from such bitter eyes that her own fell before them .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 22]: `` If you 've been treacherous to me , Jane Tanberry , '' he said , `` then God punish you !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 22]: If they 've met -- my daughter and that man -- while I was away , it is on your head .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 20]: I do n't ask you , because I believe if you knew anything you 'd lie for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 33]: But I tell you that as she read that paper , she did not hear my step on the walk nor know that I was there until I leaned over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 9]: And I swear that I suspect her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 26]: He turned and walked to the door , while the indomitable Mrs. Tanberry , silenced for once , sank into the chair he had vacated .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: Before he disappeared within the house , he paused .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 70]: `` If Mr. Vanrevel has met my daughter , '' he said , in a thick voice , stretching out both hands in a strange , menacing gesture toward the town that lay darkling in the growing dusk , `` if he has addressed one word to her , or so much as allowed his eyes to rest on her overlong , let him take care of himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 36]: `` Oh , Robert , Robert , '' Mrs. Tanberry cried , in a frightened whisper to herself , `` all the fun and brightness went out of the world when you came home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 42]: For , in truth , the gayety and light-heartedness which , during the great lady 's too brief reign , had seemed a vital adjunct of the house to make the place resound with music and laughter , were now departed .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 42]: No more did Mrs. Tanberry extemporize Dan Tuckers , mazourkas , or quadrilles in the ball-room , nor Blind-Man 's Buff in the library ; no more did serenaders nightly seek the garden with instrumental plunkings and vocal gifts of harmony .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 58]: Even the green bronze boy of the fountain seemed to share the timidity of the other youths of the town where Mr. Carewe was concerned , for the goblet he held aloft no longer sent a lively stream leaping into the sunshine in translucent gambols , but dribbled and dripped upon him like a morbid autumn rain .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 45]: The depression of the place was like a drape of mourning purple ; but not that house alone lay glum , and there were other reasons than the return of Robert Carewe why Rouen had lost the joy and mirth that belonged to it .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 28]: Nay , the merry town had changed beyond all credence ; it was hushed like a sick-room , and dolefully murmurous with forebodings of farewell and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 44]: For all the very flower of Rouen 's youth had promised to follow Tom Vanrevel on the long and arduous journey to Mexico , to march burning miles under the tropical sun , to face strange fevers and the guns of Santa Anna .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 65]: Few were the houses of the more pretentious sort that did not mourn , in prospect , the going of son , or brother , or close friend ; mothers already wept not in secret , fathers talked with husky bravado ; and everyone was very kind to those who were to go , speaking to them gently and bringing them little foolish presents .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 73]: Nor could the hearts of girls now longer mask as blocks of ice to the prospective conquistadores ; Eugene Madrillon 's young brother , Jean , after a two years ' Beatrice-and-Benedict wooing of Trixie Chenoweth -LRB- that notable spitfire -RRB- announced his engagement upon the day after his enlistment , and recounted to all who would listen how his termagant fell upon his neck in tears when she heard the news .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 18]: `` And now she cries about me all the time , '' finished the frank Jean blithely .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 74]: But there was little spirit for the old merriments : there were no more carpet-dances at the Bareauds ' , no masquerades at the Madrillons ' , no picnics in the woods nor excursions on the river ; and no more did light feet bear light hearts through the `` mazes of the intricate schottische , the subtle mazourka , or the stately quadrille , '' as Will Cummings remarked in the Journal .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 50]: Fanchon , Virginia , and five or six others , spent their afternoons mournfully , and yet proudly , sewing and cutting large pieces of colored silk , fashioning a great flag for their sweethearts and brothers to bear southward and plant where stood the palace of the Montezumas .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 64]: That was sad work for Fanchon , though it was not for her brother 's sake that she wept , since , as everyone knew , Jefferson was already so full of malaria and quinine that the fevers of the South and Mexico must find him invulnerable , and even his mother believed he would only thrive and grow hearty on his soldiering .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 65]: But about Crailey , Fanchon had a presentiment more vivid than any born of the natural fears for his safety ; it came to her again and again , reappearing in her dreams ; she shivered and started often as she worked on the flag , then bent her fair head low over the gay silks , while the others glanced at her sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 14]: She had come to feel quite sure that Crailey was to be shot .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 12]: `` But I 've dreamed it -- dreamed it six ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 15]: she cried , when he laughed , at her and tried to cheer her .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 46]: `` And it comes to me in the day-time as though I saw it with my eyes : the picture of you in an officer 's uniform , lying on the fresh , green grass , and a red stain just below the throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 16]: `` That shows what dreams are made of , dear lady , '' he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 26]: `` We 'll find little green grass in Mexico , and I 'm only a corporal ; so where 's the officer 's uniform ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 53]: Then Fanchon wept the more , and put her arms about him , while it seemed to her that she must cling to him so forever and thus withhold him from fulfilling her vision , and that the gentle pressure of her arms must somehow preserve him to life and to her .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 24]: `` Ah , you ca n't go , darling , '' she sobbed , while he petted her and tried to soothe her .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: `` You ca n't leave me !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 5]: You belong to me !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 16]: They ca n't , ca n't , ca n't take you away from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 32]: And when the flag was completed , save for sewing the stars upon the blue ground , she took it away from the others and insisted upon finishing the work herself .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 55]: To her own room she carried it , and each of the white stars that the young men of Rouen were to follow in the struggle that would add so many others to the constellation , was jewelled with her tears and kissed by her lips as it took its place with its brothers .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 35]: Never were neater stitches taken , for , with every atom of her body yearning to receive the shot that was destined for Crailey , this quiet sewing was all that she could do !
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 81]: She would have followed him , to hold a parasol over him under the dangerous sun , to cook his meals properly , to watch over him with medicines and blankets and a fan ; she would have followed barefoot and bareheaded , and yet , her heart breaking with the crucial yearning to mother him and protect him , this was all that she could for him , this small stitching at the flag he had promised to follow .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 77]: When the work was quite finished , she went all over it again with double thread , not facing the superstition of her motive , which was to safeguard her lover : the bullet that was destined for Crailey might , in the myriad chances , strike the flag first and be deflected , though never so slightly , by one of these last stitches , and Crailey 's heart thus missed by the same margin .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 60]: It was at this juncture , when the weeping of women was plentiful , when old men pulled long faces , and the very urchins of the street observed periods of gravity and even silence , that a notion entered the head of Mrs. Tanberry -- young Janie Tanberry -- to the effect that such things were all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 46]: She declared energetically that this was no decent fashion of farewell ; that after the soldiers went away there would be time enough to enact the girls they had left behind them ; and that , until then , the town should be made enlivening .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 72]: So she went about preaching a revival of cheerfulness , waving her jewelled hand merrily from the Carewe carriage to the volunteers she saw upon the street , calling out to them with laughter and inspiring quip ; everywhere scolding the mourners viciously in her husky voice , and leaving so much of heartening vivacity in her wake that none could fail to be convinced that she was a wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 8]: Nor was her vigor spent in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 45]: It was decided that a ball should be given to the volunteers of Rouen two nights before their departure for the State rendezvous , and it should be made the noblest festival in Rouen 's history ; the subscribers took their oath to it .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 32]: They rented the big dining-room at the Rouen House , covered the floor with smooth cloth , and hung the walls solidly with banners and roses , for June had come .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 55]: More , they ran a red carpet across the sidewalk -LRB- which was perfectly dry and clean -RRB- almost to the other side of the street ; they imported two extra fiddles and a clarionet to enlarge the orchestra ; and they commanded a supper such as a hungry man beholds in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 79]: Miss Betty laid out her prettiest dress that evening , and Mrs. Tanberry came in and worshipped it as it rested , like foam of lavender and white and gray , upon the bed , beside the snowy gloves with their tiny , stiff lace gauntlets , while two small white sandal-slippers , with jeweled buckles where the straps crossed each other , were being fastened upon Miss Betty 's silken feet by the vain and gloating Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 10]: `` It 's a wicked cruelty , Princess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Tanberry .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 35]: `` We want cheer the poor fellows and help them to be gay , and here do you deliberately plan to make them sick at the thought of leaving the place that holds you !
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 34]: Or have you discovered that there 's one poor vagabond of the band getting off without having his heart broken , and made up your mind to do it for him tonight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 9]: `` Is father to go with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 3]: asked Betty .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 35]: It was through Mrs. Tanberry that she now derived all information concerning Mr. Carewe , as he had not directly addressed her since the afternoon when he discovered her reading the Journal 's extra .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 11]: `` No , we are to meet him ' there .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 20]: He seems rather pleasanter than usual this evening , '' remarked Mrs. Tanberry , hopefully , as she retired .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 14]: `` Den we mus ' git ready to share big trouble tomorrer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 9]: commented the kneeling Mamie , with a giggle .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 47]: poor adoring servitress , she received a share unto herself that very evening , for her young mistress , usually as amiable as a fair summer sky , fidgetted , grumbled , found nothing well done , and was never two minutes in the same mind .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 34]: After donning the selected dress , she declared it a fright , tried two others , abused each roundly , dismissed her almost weeping handmaiden abruptly , and again put on the first .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 49]: Sitting down to the mirror , she spent a full hour over the arrangement of her hair , looking attentively at her image , sometimes with the beginning of doubtful approval , often angrily , and , now and then , beseechingly , imploring it to be lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 42]: When Mrs. Tanberry came in to tell her that Nelson was at the block with the carriage , Miss Betty did not turn , and the elder lady stopped on the threshold and gave a quick , asthmatic gasp of delight .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 102]: For the picture she saw was , without a doubt in the world , what she proclaimed it , a moment later , ravishingly pretty : the girlish little pink and white room with all its dainty settings for a background , lit by the dozen candles in their sconces and half as many slender silver candlesticks , and , seated before the twinkling mirror , the beautiful Miss Carewe , in her gown of lace and flounces that were crisp , yet soft , her rope of pearls , her white sandals , and all the glory of her youth .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 34]: She had wound a wreath of white roses into her hair , her cheeks were flushed , and her eyes warm and glowing , yet inscrutable in their long gaze into the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 18]: `` Oh , '' said Mrs. Tanberry , `` you make me want to be a man !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 19]: I 'd pick you up and run to the North Pole , where no one could ever follow .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 33]: And I can tell you that it hurts not to throw my arms round you and kiss you ; but you 're so exquisite I do n't want to touch you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 16]: In answer , Miss Betty ran to her and kissed her rapturously on both cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 8]: `` Am I -- after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 4]: `` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 3]: Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 6]: Will the roses do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 40]: And without heeding her companion 's staccatoes of approval she went rapidly to the open bureau , snatched up a double handful of ribbons and furbelows , and dashed out of the room in search of the disgraced Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 42]: She found her seated on the kitchen door-step in lonely lamentation , and showered the gifts into her lap , while the vain one shrieked inimitably with pride in the sudden vision of her mistress and joy of the incredible possessions .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 10]: `` Here , and here , and here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 13]: said Miss Betty in a breath , hurling the fineries upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 37]: `` I 'm an evil-tongued shrew , Mamie , and these are n't to make up for the pain I gave you , but just to show that I 'd like to if I knew how !
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 9]: And she was off like an April breeze .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 45]: `` Dance wid the han ` somdest , '' screamed Mamie , pursuing uproariously to see the last of her as she jumped into the carriage , `` bow to de wittriest , an ' kiss de one you love de bes ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 7]: `` That will be you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 14]: said Miss Betty to Mrs. Tanberry , and kissed the good lady again .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 37]: `` Those Endearing Young Charms '' It is a matter not of notoriety but of the happiest celebrity that Mrs. Tanberry danced that night , and not only that she danced , but that she waltzed .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 45]: To the lot of Tappingham Marsh -LRB- whom she pronounced the most wheedlmg vagabond , next to Crailey Gray , of her acquaintance -RRB- it fell to persuade her ; and , after a quadrille with the elder Chenoweth , she was with Tappingham .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 14]: More extraordinary to relate , she danced down both her partner and music .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 33]: Thereupon did Mr. Bareaud , stung with envy , dare emulation and essay a schottische with Miss Trixie Chenoweth , performing marvelously well for many delectable turns before he unfortunately fell down .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 47]: It was a night when a sculptured god would have danced on his pedestal : June , but not over-warm , balm in the air and rose leaves on the breeze ; and even Minerva 's great heels might have marked the time that orchestra kept .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 56]: Be sure they waltzed again to `` Those Endearing Young Charms '' : `` Oh , the heart that has truly loved never forgets , But as truly loves on to the close : as the sunflower turns on her god when he sets , The same look that she gave when he rose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 37]: Three of the volunteers were resplendent in their regimentals : Mr. Marsh -LRB- who had been elected captain of the new company to succeed Vanrevel -RRB- , and Will Cummings and Jean Madrillon , the lieutenants .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 31]: This glory was confined to the officers , who had ordered their uniforms at home , for the privates and non-commissioned officers were to receive theirs at the State rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 37]: However , although this gala adornment was limited to the three gentlemen mentioned , their appearance added `` an indescribable air of splendor and pathos to the occasion , '' to quote Mr. Cummings once more .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 53]: A fourth citizen of the town who might have seized upon this opportunity to display himself as a soldier neglected to take advantage of it and stole in quietly , toward the last , in his ordinary attire , leaving his major 's uniform folded on a chair in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 30]: The flag was to be presented to the volunteers at the close of the evening , and Tom came for that -- so he claimed to his accusing soul .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 46]: He entered unobserved and made his way , keeping close to the wall , to where Mrs. Bareaud sat , taking a chair at her side ; but Robert Carewe , glancing thither by chance , saw him , and changed countenance for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 33]: Mr. Carewe composed his features swiftly , excused himself with elaborate courtesy from Miss Chenoweth , with whom he was talking , and crossed the room to a corner near his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 30]: Presently , as the music ceased , the volunteers were bidden to come forward , whereupon Tom left Mrs. Bareaud and began to work his way down the room .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 46]: Groups were forming and breaking up in the general movement of the crowd , and the dissolving of one brought him face to face with Elizabeth Carewe , who was moving slowly in the opposite direction , a small flock of suitors in her train .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 44]: The confrontation came so suddenly and so unexpectedly that , before either was aware , they looked squarely into each other 's eyes , full and straight , and both stopped instantly as though transfixed , Miss Betty leaving a sentence forever half-complete .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 39]: There was a fierce , short vocal sound from the crowd behind Vanrevel ; but no one noticed Mr. Carewe ; and then Tom bowed gravely , as in apology for blocking the way , and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 34]: Miss Betty began to talk again , much at random , with a vivacity too greatly exaggerated to be genuine , while the high color went from her cheeks and left her pale .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 28]: Nothing could have enraged her more with herself than the consciousness , now suddenly strong within her , that the encounter had a perceptible effect upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 13]: What power had this man to make her manner strained and mechanical ?
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 13]: What right had his eyes always to stir her as they did ?
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 77]: It was not he for whom she had spent an hour over her hair ; not he for whom she had driven her poor handmaiden away in tears : that was for one who had not come , one great in heart and goodness , one of a pure and sacrificial life who deserved all she could give , and for whose sake she had honored herself in trying to look as pretty as she could .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 48]: He had not come ; and that hurt her a little , but she felt his generosity , believing that his motive was to spare her , since she could not speak to him in Mr Carewe 's presence without open and public rupture with her father .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 18]: Well , she was almost ready for that , seeing how little of a father hers was !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 26]: that other should have come , if only to stand between her and this tall hypocrite whose dark glance had such strength to disturb her .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 12]: What lies that gaze contained , all in the one flash !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 45]: -- the strange pretence of comprehending her gently but completely , a sad compassion , too , and with it a look of farewell , seeming to say : `` Once more I have come for this -- and just , ` Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 34]: For she knew that he was going with the others , going perhaps forever , only the day after tomorrow -- then she would see him no more and be free of him .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 8]: Let the day after tomorrow come soon !
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 39]: Miss Betty hated herself for understanding the adieu , and hated herself more because she could not be sure that , in the startled moment of meeting before she collected herself , she had let it go unanswered .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 31]: She had done more than that : without knowing it she had bent her head to his bow , and Mr. Carewe had seen both the salutation and the look .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 55]: The young men were gathered near the orchestra , and , to the hilarious strains of `` Yankee Doodle , '' the flag they were to receive for their regiment was borne down the room by the sisters and sweethearts who had made it , all of whom were there , except Fanchon Bareaud .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 29]: Crailey had persuaded her to surrender the flag for the sake of spending this evening -- next to his last in Rouen -- at home alone with him .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 34]: The elder Chenoweth made the speech of presentation , that is , he made part of it before he broke down , for his son stood in the ranks of the devoted band .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 24]: Until this incident occurred , all had gone trippingly , for everyone had tried to put the day after to-morrow from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 70]: Perhaps there might not have been so many tears even now , if the young men had not stood together so smilingly to receive their gift ; it was seeing them so gay and confident , so strong in their youth and so unselfish of purpose ; it was this , and the feeling that all of them must suffer and some of them die before they came back .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 39]: So that when Mr. Chenoweth , choking in his loftiest flight , came to a full stop , and without disguise buried his face in his handkerchief , Mrs. Tanberry , the apostle of gayety , openly sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 41]: Chenoweth , without more ado , carried the flag over to Tappingham Marsh , whom Vanrevel directed to receive it , and Tappingham thanked the donors without many words , because there were not then many at his command . .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 36]: Miss Carewe bad been chosen to sing `` The Star Spangled Banner , '' and she stepped out a little from the crowd to face the young men as the orchestra sounded the first chord .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 42]: She sang in a full , clear voice , but when the volunteers saw that , as she sang , the tears were streaming down her cheeks in spite of the brave voice , they began to choke with the others .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 19]: If Miss Betty found them worth weeping for , they could afford to cry a little for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 27]: Yet they joined the chorus nobly , and raised the roof with the ringing song , sending the flamboyant , proud old words thunderously to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 10]: That was not the last song of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 45]: General Trumble and Mr. Chenoweth had invited their young friends to attend , after the ball , a collation which they chose to call a supper , but which , to accord with the hour , might more aptly have been designated a breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 61]: To afford a private retreat for the scene of this celebration , they had borrowed the offices of Gray and Vanrevel , and Crailey hospitably announced that any guest was welcome to stay for a year or two , since , probably , neither of the firm would have need of an office for at least that length of time .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 107]: Nine men gathered about the table which replaced Tom 's work-a-day old desk : the two Chenoweths , Eugene Madrillon , Marsh , Jefferson Bareaud , the stout General , Tom Vanrevel , Crailey , and Will Cummings , the editor coming in a little late , but rubbing his hands cheerfully over what he declared was to be the last column from his pen to rear its length on the Journal 's front page for many a long day -- a description of the presentation of the flag , a bit of prose which he considered almost equal to his report of the warehouse fire .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 56]: This convivial party made merry and tried to forget that most of them had `` been mighty teary , '' as Marsh said , an hour earlier ; while Mr. Chenoweth sat with his hand on his son 's shoulder , unconsciously most of the time , apologetically removing , it when he observed it .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 50]: Many were the witticisms concerning the difference in rank hence forth to be observed between the young men , as Tom was now a major , Marsh a captain , Will Cummings a second lieutenant , and the rest mere privates , except Crailey , who was a corporal .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 21]: Nevertheless , though the board was festive , it was somewhat subdued and absent until they came to the toasts .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 9]: It was Tappingham who proposed Miss Betty Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 27]: `` I know Tom Vanrevel will understand -- nay , I know he 's man enough to join us , '' said Marsh as he rose .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 79]: `` Why should n't I say that we may hail ourselves as patriots , indeed , since at the call of our country we depart from the town which is this lady 's home , and at the trumpet 's sound resign the gracious blessing of seeing her day by day , and why should n't we admit loyally and openly that it is her image alone which shines in the hearts of most of us here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 33]: And no man arose to contradict that speech , which appears to have rung true , seeing that four of those present had proposed to her -LRB- again -RRB- that same evening .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 27]: `` So I give you , '' cried Tappingham , gallantly , `` the health of Miss Betty Carewe , the loveliest rose of our bouquet !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 10]: May she remember us when we come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 9]: They rose and drank it with a shout .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 50]: But Tom Vanrevel , not setting down his cup , went to the window and threw wide the shutters , letting in a ruddy shaft of the morning sun , so that as he stood in the strong glow he looked like a man carved out of red gold .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 29]: He lifted his glass , not toward the table and his companions , while they stared at him , surprised , but toward the locusts of Carewe Street .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 18]: `` To Miss Betty Carewe , '' he said , `` the finest flower of them all !
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 10]: May she remember those who never come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 102]: And , without pausing , he lifted his rich baritone in an old song that had been vastly popular with the young men of Rouen ever since the night of Miss Betty 's debut ; they had hummed it as they went about their daily work , they had whistled it on the streets ; they had drifted , into dreams at night with the sound of it still chiming in their ears ; and now , with one accord , as they stood gathered together for the last time in Rouen , they joined Tom Vanrevel and sang it again .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 90]: And the eyes of Crailey Gray rested very gently upon his best friend as they sang : `` Believe me , If all those endearing young charms , Which I gaze on so fondly to-day , Were to change by to-morrow and fleet from my arms , Like fairy gifts fading away , Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art : Let thy loveliness fade as it will , And around the dear ruin , each wish of my heart Would entwine itself verdantly still .

Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 24]: The Price of Silence It was the misfortune of Mr. Cummings 's first literary offering to annoy one of the editor 's friends .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 26]: The Journal was brought to the corporal at noon , while he was considering whether he should rise from his couch or sleep another hour .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 49]: Reclining among his pillows , he glanced through Cummings 's description with the subdued giggle he always had for the good William 's style but as his eye fell upon one paragraph he started sat upright , and proceeded to read the passage several times with anxious attention .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 28]: `` Only two or three sources of regret occurred to mar the delight -LRB- in which young and old participated -RRB- of that festal and dazzling scene .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 68]: One was the absence of Miss Fanchon Bareaud , one the donors ; another , that of Corporal Gray ; a third was the excessive modesty of Major Vanrevel , although present at the time , refused to receive the ladies ' sumptuous offering and insisted that Captain Marsh was the proper person to do the honors , to which the latter reluctantly , though gracefully consented .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 25]: Also , we were sorry that the Major appeared in citizen 's dress , as all were anxious to witness him in his uniform .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 61]: However , in our humble judgment , he will be compelled by etiquette to don it this afternoon , to receive the officers of the regular army , who will arrive by the stage about five o'clock , it is expected , to inspect the company and swear them into the service of the Federal Government at the Court House .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 35]: We , for one , have little doubt that , owing to the Major 's well-known talent in matters of apparel , his appearance will far eclipse in brilliancy that of his fellow-officers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 18]: Crailey dressed slowly , returning to the paper , now and then , with a perturbed countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 33]: How would Miss Betty explain this paragraph to herself , and how account for the fact that she had not seen Crailey , how for the fact that she had seen Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 24]: It seemed unlikely that she could have overlooked the latter -- Tom was one of those whom everybody saw , wherever he went .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 7]: And what inquiries would she make ?
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 15]: For Crailey had no means of knowing that she would not see the Journal .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 22]: Tomorrow he would be gone , it would be all over , but he wanted this last day to run smoothly .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 51]: What wild hopes he had of things that should happen when they all came marching home , no one can say ; even if it were not to be doubted that Crailey ever entertained hopes of any kind whatever , since to hope is to bestow thought upon the future .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 53]: But , however affairs ran with him so far as hope was concerned , he seldom lacked an idea ; and one came to him presently , a notion that put the frown to rout and brought the old smile to his lips , his smile of the world-worn and tolerant prelate .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 22]: He flicked the paper lightly from him , and it sped across the room like a big bird in awkward flight .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 19]: For he knew how to preserve his last day as he wished , and to make all smooth .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 41]: He finished his toilet with particular care , took a flower from a vase on his table , placed it in his coat , and went down to the dusty street , where everything was warm and bright with summer .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 33]: It was joy to be alive ; there was wine enough in the air ; and Crailey made up his mind not to take a drink that day -- the last day !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 4]: The last day !
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 16]: The three words kept ringing through his head like a minor phrase from a song .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 24]: Tomorrow , at noon , they would be churning down the river ; and this was the last day -- the last day !
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 44]: `` Still not too late to make another friend at home , '' he said , stopping to pat the head of a mangy street cur that came crouching and wobbling toward him like a staveless little keg worried by scurries of wind .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 27]: Dogs and children always fell in love with Crailey at first sight , and he never failed to receive them in the spirit of their approach .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 72]: Now the mongrel , at his touch , immediately turned himself over and lay upon the pavement with all paws in air , to say : `` Great lord , magnificent in the graciousness which deigns to cast a glimpse upon this abject cluster of ribs , I perceive that your heart is too gentle to kick me in my present helplessness ; yet do with me as you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 28]: `` I doubt if you 've breakfasted , brother , '' Crailey responded aloud , rubbing the dog 's head softly with the tip of his boot .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 27]: `` Will you share the meagre fare of one who is a poet , should be a lawyer , but is about to become a soldier ?
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 6]: Eh , but a corporal !
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 5]: Rise , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 2]: Up !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 13]: and be in your own small self a whole Corporal 's Guard !
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 19]: And if your Corporal does n't come home from the wars , perhaps you 'll remember him kindly ?
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 3]: Think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 34]: He made a vivacious gesture , the small animal sprang into the air , convoluted with gratitude and new love , while Crailey , laughing softly , led the way to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 36]: There , while he ate sparsely himself , he provided munificently for his new acquaintance , and recommended him , with an accompaniment of silver , to the good offices of the Rouen House kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 27]: After that , out into the sunshine again he went , with elastic step , and a merry word and a laugh for everyone he met .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 35]: At the old English gardener 's he bought four or five bouquets , and carried them on a round of visits of farewell to as many old ladies who had been kind to him .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 68]: This done , leaving his laughter and his flowers behind him , he went to Fanchon and spent part of the afternoon bringing forth cunning arguments cheerily , to prove to her that General Taylor would be in the Mexican capital before the volunteers reached New Orleans , and urging upon her his belief that they would all be back in Rouen before the summer was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 14]: But Fanchon could only sob and whisper , `` Hush , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 48]: in the dim room where they sat , the windows darkened so that , after he had gone , he should not remember how red her eyes were , and the purple depths under them , and thus forget how pretty she had been at her best .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 76]: After a time , finding that the more he tried to cheer her , the more brokenly she wept , he grew silent , only stroking her head , while the summer sounds came in through the window : the mill-whir of locusts , the small monotone of distant farm-bells , the laughter of children in the street , and the gay arias of a mocking-bird singing in the open window of the next house .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 15]: So they sat together through the long , still afternoon of the last day .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 10]: No one in Rouen found that afternoon particularly enlivening .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 61]: Even Mrs. Tanberry gave way to the common depression , and , once more , her doctrine of cheerfulness relegated to the ghostly ranks of the purely theoretical , she bowed under the burden of her woe so far as to sing `` Methought I Met a Damsel Fair '' -LRB- her of the bursting sighs -RRB- at the piano .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 25]: Whenever sadness lay upon her soul she had acquired the habit of resorting to this unhappy ballad ; today she sang it four times .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 50]: Mr. Carewe was not at home , and had announced that though he intended to honor the evening meal by his attendance , he should be away for the evening itself ; as comment upon which statement Mrs. Tanberry had offered ambiguously the one word , `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 64]: He was stung to no reply , and she had noted the circumstance as unusual , and also that he had appeared to labor with the suppression of a keen excitement , which made him anxious to escape from her sharp little eyes ; an agitation for which she easily accounted when she recalled that he had seen Vanrevel on the previous evening .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 62]: Mr. Carewe had kept his promise to preserve the peace , as he always kept it when the two met on neutral ground , but she had observed that his face showed a kind of hard-leashed violence whenever he had been forced to breathe the air of the same room with his enemy , and that the thing grew on him .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 35]: Miss Betty exhibited not precisely a burning interest in the adventure of the Damsel Fair , wandering out of the room during the second rendition , wandering back again , and once more away .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 24]: She had moved about the house in this fashion since early morning , wearing what Mamie described as a `` peak-ed look . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 47]: White-faced and restless , with distressed eyes , to which no sleep had come in the night , she could not read ; she could no more than touch her harp ; she could not sleep ; she could not remain quiet for three minutes together .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 38]: Often she sank into a chair with an air of languor and weariness , only to start immediately out of it and seek some other part of the house , or to go and pace the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 49]: Here , in the air heavy with roses and tremulous with June , as she walked rapidly up and down , late in the afternoon , at the time when the faraway farm-bells were calling men from the fields to supper , the climax of her restlessness came .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 32]: That anguish and desperation , so old in her sex , the rebellion against the law that inaction must be her part , had fallen upon her for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 17]: She came to an abrupt stop and struck her hands together despairingly , and spoke aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 6]: `` What shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 6]: What shall I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 9]: asked a surprised voice , just behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 20]: She wheeled quickly about , to behold a shock-headed urchin of ten in the path near the little clearing .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 30]: He was ragged , tanned , dusty , neither shoes nor coat trammelling his independence ; and he had evidently entered the garden through the gap in the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: `` I thought you spoke to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 5]: he said , inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 11]: `` I did n't see you , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 6]: `` You Miss Carewe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 21]: he asked ; but before she could answer he said , reassuringly , `` Why , of course you are !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 17]: I remember you perfect , now I git the light on you , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 7]: Do n't you remember me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: `` No , I do n't think I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 4]: `` Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 5]: he responded , wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 21]: `` I was one of the boys with you on them boxes the night of your pa 's fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 30]: Mingled with the surprise in his tone was a respectful unction which intimated how greatly he honored her father for having been the owner of so satisfactory a conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 4]: `` Were you ?
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 12]: Perhaps I 'll remember you if you give me time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 49]: But at this point the youth recalled the fact that he had an errand to discharge , and , assuming an expression of businesslike haste too pressing to permit farther parley , sought in his pocket and produced a sealed envelope , with which he advanced upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 3]: `` Here .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 5]: There 's an answer .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 65]: He told me not to tell nobody who sent it , and not to give it to nobody on earth but you , and how to slip in through the hedge and try and find you in the garden when nobody was lookin ' , and he give a pencil for you to answer on the back of it , and a dollar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 32]: Miss Betty took the note , glancing once over her shoulder at the house , but Mrs. Tanberry was still occupied with the Maiden , and no one was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 6]: She read the message hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 10]: `` I have obeyed you , and shall always .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 7]: You have not sent for me .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: Perhaps that was because there was no time when you thought it safe .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 13]: Perhaps you have still felt there would be a loss of dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 8]: Does that weigh with you against good-by ?
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 32]: Tell me , if you can , that you have it in your heart to let me go without seeing you once more , without good-by -- for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: Or was it untrue that you wrote me what you did ?
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 12]: Was that dear letter but a little fairy dream of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 30]: Ah , will you see me again , this once -- this once -- let me look at you , let me talk with you , hear your voice ?
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 5]: The last time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 5]: There was no signature .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 16]: Miss Betty quickly wrote four lines upon the same sheet : `` Yes -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 13]: I must see you , must talk with you before you go .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 4]: Come at dusk .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 10]: The garden -- near the gap in the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 9]: It will be safe for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 7]: He will not be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 27]: She replaced the paper in its envelope , drew a line through her own name on the letter , and wrote `` Mr. Vanrevel '' underneath .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 11]: `` Do you know the gentleman who sent you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 29]: `` No 'm ; but he 'll be waitin ' at his office , ` Gray and Vanrevel , ' on Main Street , for the answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 5]: `` Then hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 3]: said Betty .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 24]: He needed no second bidding , but , with wings on his bare heels , made off through the gap in the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 24]: At the corner of the street he encountered an adventure , a gentleman 's legs and a heavy hand at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 53]: The hand fell on his shoulder , arresting his scamper with a vicious jerk ; and the boy was too awed to attempt an escape , for he knew his captor well by sight , although never before had he found himself so directly in the company of Rouen 's richest citizen .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 45]: The note dropped from the small trembling fingers , yet those fingers did not shake as did the man 's when , like a flash , Carewe seized upon the missive with his disengaged hand and saw what two names were on the envelope .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 9]: `` You were stealing , were you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 5]: he cried , savagely .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 10]: `` I saw you sneak through my hedge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 8]: `` I did n't , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 14]: Mr. Carewe ground his teeth , `` What were you doing there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 3]: mocked Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 17]: You did n't carry this to the young lady in there and get her answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 6]: `` No , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 6]: answered the captive , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 8]: `` Cross my heart I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 5]: I found it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 48]: Slowly the corrugations of anger were levelled from the magnate 's face , the white heat cooled , and the prisoner marvelled to find himself in the presence of an urbane gentleman whose placidity made the scene of a moment ago appear some trick of distorted vision .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 42]: And yet , curious to behold , Mr. Carewe 's fingers shook even more violently than before , as he released the boy 's shoulder and gave him a friendly tap on the head , at the same time smiling benevolently .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 16]: `` There , there , '' he said , bestowing a wink upon the youngster .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 24]: `` It 's all right ; it does n't matter -- only I think I see the chance of a jest in this .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 17]: You wait , while I read this little note , this message that you found ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 10]: He ended by winking again with the friendliest drollery .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 26]: He turned his back to the boy , and opened the note ; continuing to stand in that position while he read the two messages .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 46]: It struck the messenger that , after this , there need be no great shame in his own lack of this much-vaunted art of reading , since it took so famous a man as Mr. Carewe such length of time to peruse a little note .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 40]: But perhaps the great gentleman was ill , for it appeared to the boy that he lurched several times , once so far that he would have gone over if he had not saved himself by a lucky stagger .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 40]: And once , except for the fact that the face that had turned away had worn an expression of such genial humor , the boy would have believed that from it issued a sound like the gnashing of teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 50]: But when it was turned to him again , it bore the same amiable jocosity of mouth and eye , and nothing seemed to be the matter , except that those fingers still shook so wildly , too wildly , indeed , to restore the note to its envelope .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 20]: `` There , '' said Mr. Carewe , `` put it back , laddie , put it back yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 9]: Take it to the gentleman who sent you .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 11]: I see he 's even disguised his hand a trifle-ha !
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 23]: -- and I suppose he may not have expected the young lady to write his name quite so boldly on the envelope !
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 6]: What do you suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 9]: `` I d'know , '' returned the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 10]: `` I reckon I do n't hardly understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 16]: `` No , of course not , '' said Mr. Carewe , laughing rather madly .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: `` Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 6]: Of course you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 9]: And how much did he give you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 4]: `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 6]: cried the other , joyously .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 12]: `` Did n't he go and hand me a dollar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 29]: `` How much will you take not to tell him that I stopped you and read it ; how much not to speak of me at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 12]: `` It 's a foolish kind of joke , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 17]: I 'll give you five dollars never to tell anyone that you saw me today . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 30]: `` Do n't shoot , Colonel , '' exclaimed the youth , with a riotous fling of bare feet in the air , `` I 'll come down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 7]: `` You 'll do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 4]: `` Five ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 8]: he shouted , dancing upon the boards .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 3]: `` Five !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 27]: I 'll cross my heart to die I never hear tell of you , or ever knew they was sich a man in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 5]: Carewe bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 23]: Say : ` God strike me dead and condemn me eternally to the everlasting flames of hell if I ever tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 15]: This entailed quick sobriety , though only benevolence was in the face above him .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 11]: The jig-step stopped , and the boy pondered , frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 9]: `` Have I got to say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 13]: Mr. Carewe produced a bank-bill about which the boy beheld a halo .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 20]: Clearly this was his day ; heaven showed its approval of his conduct by an outpouring of imperishable riches .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 38]: And yet the oath misliked him ; there was a savor of the demoniacal contract ; still that was to be borne and the plunge taken , for there fluttered the huge sum before his dazzled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 7]: He took a deep breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 24]: ` God strike me dead ' '' -- he began , slowly -- '' ' if I ever ' -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 20]: ` And condemn me to the everlasting flames of hell ' -- '' `` Have I got to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 24]: -- '' ` And condemn me to -- to the everlasting flames of -- of hell , if I ever tell ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 49]: He ran off , pale with the fear that he might grow up , take to drink and some day tell in his cups , but so resolved not to coquet with temptation that he went round a block to avoid the door of the Rouen House bar .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 15]: Nevertheless , the note was in his hand and the fortune in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: And Mr. Carewe was safe .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 73]: He knew that the boy would never tell , and he knew another thing , for he had read the Journal , though it came no more to his house : he knew that Tom Vanrevel wore his uniform that evening , and that , even in the dusk , the brass buttons on an officer 's breast make a good mark for a gun steadied along the ledge of a window .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 24]: As he entered the gates and went toward the house he glanced up at the window which overlooked his garden from the cupola .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 31]: The Uniform Crailey was not the only man in Rouen who had been saying to himself all day that each accustomed thing he did was done for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 49]: Many of his comrades went about with `` Farewell , old friend , '' in their hearts , not only for the people , but for the usual things of life and the actions of habit , now become unexpectedly dear and sweet to know or to perform .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 93]: So Tom Vanrevel , relieved of his hot uniform , loose as to collar , wearing a big dressing-gown , and stretched in a chair , watched the sunset from the western window of the dusty office , where he had dreamed through many sun-sets in summers past , and now took his leave of this old habit of his in silence , with a long cigar , considering the chances largely against his ever seeing the sun go down behind the long wooden bridge at the foot of Main Street again .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 77]: The ruins of the warehouses had been removed , and the river was laid clear to his sight ; it ran between brown banks like a river of rubies , and , at the wharf , the small evening steamboat , ugly and grim enough to behold from near by , lay pink and lovely in that broad glow , tooting imminent departure , although an hour might elapse before it would back into the current .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 74]: The sun widened , clung briefly to the horizon , and dropped behind the low hills beyond the bottom lands ; the stream grew purple , then took on a lustre of pearl as the stars came out , while rosy distances changed to misty blue ; the chatter of the birds in the Main Street maples became quieter , and , through lessening little choruses of twittering , fell gradually to silence .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 22]: And now the blue dusk crept on the town , and the corner drug-store window-lights threw mottled colors on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 37]: From the hall , outside the closed office-door , came the sound of quick , light footsteps ; it was Crailey going out ; but Tom only sighed to himself , and did not hail him .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 20]: So these light footsteps of Crailey Gray echoed but a moment in the stairway and were heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 28]: A few moments later a tall figure , dressed from neck to heels in a gray cloak crossed the mottled lights , and disappeared into Carewe Street .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 35]: This cloaked person wore on his head a soldier 's cap , and Tom , not recognizing him surely , vaguely wondered why Tappingham Marsh chose to muffle himself so warmly on a evening .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 29]: He noted the quick , alert tread as like Marsh 's usual gait , but no suspicion crossed his mind that the figure might be that of partner .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 69]: A rocket went up from the Rouen House , then another , followed by a salvo of anvils and rackety discharge of small-arms ; the beginning a noble display of fireworks in celebration of prospective victories of the United States and utter discomfiture of the Mexicans when the Rouen Volunteers should reach the seat of war , an Exhibition of patriotism which brought little pleasure to Mr. Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 27]: But over the noise of the street he heard his own name shouted from the stairway , and almost instantly a violent knocking assailed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 36]: Be-fore he could bid the visitor enter , the door was flung open by a stout and excited colored woman , who , at sight of him , threw up her hands in tremulous thanksgiving .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 6]: It was the vain Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: She sank into a chair , and rocked herself to and fro , gasping to regain her lost breath .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 14]: `` Bless de good God ` Imighty you am ' gone out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 3]: she panted .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 29]: `` I run an ' I run , an ' I come so fas ' I got stitches in de side f ` um head to heel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 14]: Tom brought her a glass of water , which she drank between gasps .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 18]: `` I nevah run so befo ' enduin ' my livin ' days , '' she asserted .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 35]: `` You knows me , who I am an ' whum I cum f ` um , nigh 's well 's I knows who you is , I reckon , Maje ' Vanrevel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 9]: Will you tell me who sent you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 23]: `` Miz Tanberry , suh , dat who sended me , an ' in a venomous hurry she done de same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: Does she want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 6]: Mamie emitted a screech . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 13]: ` Deed she mos ' everlas ` in ` ly does not !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 18]: Dat de ve ' y exackindes ' livin ' t ` ing she does not want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 9]: `` Then what is it , Mamie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 21]: `` Lem me git my bref , suh , an ' you hole yo ` ne whiles I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 20]: She say to me , she say : ` Is you ` quainted Maje ' Vanrevel , Mamie ? '
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 42]: s ' she , an ' I up 'n' ansuh , ` Not to speak wid , but dey ain ; none on 'em I don ' knows by sight , an ' none betterer dan him , ' I say .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 60]: Den she say , she say : ` You run all de way an ' fin ' dat young man , ' she say , s ' she , ` an ' if you don ' git dah fo ' he leave , er don ' stop him on de way , den God ` imighty fergive you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 3]: she say .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 22]: ` But you tell him f ` um Jane Tanberry not to come nigh dis house or dis gyahden dis night !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 23]: Tell him dat Jane Tanberry warn him he mus ' keep outer Carewe 's way ontel he safe on de boat to-morrer .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 27]: Tell him Jane Tanberry beg him to stay in he own room dis night , an ' dat she beg it on her bented knees ! '
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 21]: An ' dis she say to me when I tole her what Nelson see in dat house dis evenin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 26]: An ' hyuh I is , an ' hyuh yew is , an ' de blessed Jesus be thank ' , you ir hyuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 8]: Tom regarded her with a grave attention .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 14]: `` What made Mrs. Tanberry think I might be coming there to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 16]: `` Dey 's cur ` ous goin 's - on in dat house , suh !
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 25]: De young lady she ain ' like herself ; all de day long she wanduh up an ' down an ' roun ' about .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 42]: Miz Tanberry are a mighty guessifying woman , an ' de minute I tell her what Nelse see , she s ` pec ' you a-comin ' an ' dat de boss mos ' pintedly preparin ' fo ' it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 13]: `` Can you make it a little clearer for me , Mamie ?
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 9]: I 'm afraid I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 42]: `` Well , suh , you know dat ole man Nelson , he allays tell me ev ` yt ` ing he know , an ' ev ` yt ` ing he think he know , jass de same , suh .

Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 9]: `` No ; I was n't going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: Tom smiled upon her sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 10]: `` I dare say there 's a simpler explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 50]: Do n't you suppose that if Nelson was right and Mr. Carewe really did come back , it was because he did not wish his daughter and Mrs. Tanberry to know that -- that he expected a party of friends , possibly , to join him there later ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 11]: `` What he doin ' wid dat gun , suh ?
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 16]: Nobody goin ' play cyahds ner frow dice wid a gun , is dey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: asked Mamie , as she rose and walked toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 10]: `` Oh , that was probably by chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 6]: `` No , suh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 5]: she cried , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 44]: `` An ' dem gelmun wouldn ' play t ' - night , no way ; mos ' on 'em goin ' wid you to-morrer an ' dey sayin ' goodby to de ' r folks dis evenin ' , not gamblin ' !

Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 20]: I kin tell her dat you say you sutney ain ' comin ' nigh our neighborhood dis night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 13]: `` I had not dreamed of coming , tell her , please .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 11]: Probably I shall not go out at all this evening .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 9]: But it was kind of you to come .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 25]: He stood with a candle to light her down the stairs , but after she had gone he did not return to the office .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 35]: Instead , he went slowly up to his own room , glancing first into Crailey 's -- the doors of neither were often locked -- to behold a chaos of disorder and unfinished packing .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 48]: In his own chamber it only remained for him to close the lids of a few big boxes , and to pack a small trunk which he meant to take with him to the camp of the State troops , and he would be ready for departure .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 43]: He set about this task , and , concluding that there was no necessity to wear his uniform on the steamboat , decided to place it in the trunk , and went to the bed where he had folded and left it .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: It was not there .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 12]: Nor did a thorough search reveal it anywhere in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 24]: Yet no one could have stolen it , for when he had gone down to the office Crailey had remained on this floor .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 33]: Mamie had come within a few minutes after Crailey went out , and during his conversation with her the office-door had been open ; no one could have passed without being seen .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 28]: Also , a thief would have taken other things as well as the uniform ; and surely Crailey must have heard ; Crailey would -- Crailey -- !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 25]: Then Tom remembered the figure in the long cloak and the military cap , and , with a sick heart , began to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 23]: He had read the Journal , and he knew why Crailey might wish to masquerade in a major 's uniform that night .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 24]: If Miss Carewe read it too , and a strange wonder rose in her mind , this and a word would convince her .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 71]: Tom considered it improbable that the wonder would rise , for circumstances had too well established her in a mistake , trivial and ordinary enough at first , merely the confusing of two names by a girl new to the town , but so strengthened by every confirmation Crailey 's wit could compass that she would , no doubt , only set Cummings 's paragraph aside as a newspaper error .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 12]: Still , Crailey had wished to be on the safe side !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 5]: Tom sighed rather bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 55]: He was convinced that the harlequin would come home soon , replace the uniform -LRB- which was probably extremely becoming to him , as they were of a height and figure much the same -RRB- , and afterward , in his ordinary dress , would sally forth to spend his last evening with Fanchon .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 68]: Tom wondered how Crailey would feel and what he would think about himself while he was changing his clothes , but he remembered his partner 's extraordinary powers of mental adjustment -- and for the first time in his life Vanrevel made no allowance for the other 's temperament , and there came to him a moment when he felt that he could almost dislike Crailey Gray .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 28]: At all events , he would go out until Crailey had come and left again , for he had no desire to behold the masquerader 's return .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 44]: So he exchanged his dressing-gown for a coat , fastened his collar , and had begun to arrange his cravat at the mirror , when , suddenly , the voice of the old negress seemed to sound close beside him in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 11]: `` He 's settin ' dah -- waitin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 25]: The cravat was never tied ; Tom 's hands dropped to his sides as he started back from the staring face in the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 49]: Robert Carewe was waiting -- and Crailey -- All at once there was but one vital necessity in the world for Tom Vanrevel , that was to find Crailey ; he must go to Crailey -- even in Carewe 's own house -- he must go to Crailey !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: He dashed down the stairs and into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 43]: The people were making a great uproar in front of the hotel , exploding bombs , firing muskets in the air , sending up rockets ; and rapidly crossing the outskirts of the crowd , he passed into Carewe Street , unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 39]: Here the detonations were not so deafening , though the little steamboat at the wharf was contributing to the confusion with all in her power , screeching simultaneously approval of the celebration and her last signals of departure .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 59]: At the first corner Tom had no more than left the sidewalk when he came within a foot of being ridden down by two horsemen who rode at so desperate a gallop that -LRB- the sound of their hoof-beats being lost in the uproar from Main Street -RRB- they were upon him before he was aware of them .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 18]: He leaped back with an angry shout to know who they were that they rode so wildly .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 69]: At the same time a sharp explosion at the foot of the street sent a red flare over the scene , a flash , gone with such incredible swiftness into renewed darkness that he saw the flying horsemen almost as equestrian statues illumined by a flicker of lightning , but he saw them with the same distinctness that lightning gives , and recognized the foremost as Robert Carewe .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 30]: And in the instant of that recognition , Tom knew what had happened to Crailey Gray , for he saw the truth in the ghastly face of his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 43]: Carewe rode stiffly , like a man frozen upon his horse , and his face was like that of a frozen man ; his eyes glassy and not fixed upon his course , so that it was a deathly thing to see .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 22]: Once , long ago , Tom had seen a man riding for his life , and he wore this same look .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 37]: The animal bounded and swerved under Vanrevel 's enemy in the mad rush down the street , but he sat rigid , bolt upright in the saddle , his face set to that look of coldness .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 44]: The second rider was old Nelson , who rode with body crouched forward , his eyeballs like shining porcelain set in ebony , and his arm like a flail , cruelly lashing his own horse and his master 's with a heavy whip .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 5]: `` De steamboat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 17]: he shouted , hoarsely , bringing down the lash on one and then on the other .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 20]: `` De steamboat , de steamboat -- f o ' God 's sake , honey , de steamboat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 50]: They swept into Main Street , Nelson leaning far across to the other 's bridle , and turning both horses toward the river , but before they had made the corner , Tom Vanrevel was running with all the speed that was in him toward his enemy 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 56]: The one block between him and that forbidden ground seemed to him miles long , and he felt that he was running as a man in a dream , and , at the highest pitch of agonized exertion , covering no space , but only working the air in one place , like a treadmill .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 16]: All that was in his mind , heart , and soul was to reach Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 44]: He had known by the revelation of Carewe 's face in what case he would find his friend ; but as he ran he put the knowledge from him with a great shudder , and resolved upon incredulity in spite of his certainty .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 37]: All he let himself feel was the need to run , to run until he found Crailey , who was somewhere in the darkness of the trees about the long , low house on the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 41]: When he reached the bordering hedge , he did not stay for gate or path , but , with a loud shout , hurled himself half over , half through , the hedge , like a bolt from a catapult .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 39]: Lights shone from only one room in the house , the library ; but as he ran toward the porch a candle flickered in the hall , and there came the sound of a voice weeping with terror .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 21]: At that he called more desperately upon his incredulity to aid him , for the voice was Mrs. Tan-berry 's .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 22]: If it had been any other than she , who sobbed so hopelessly -- she who was always steady and strong !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 29]: If he could , he would have stopped to pray , now , before he faced her and the truth ; but his flying feet carried him on .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 9]: she gasped , brokenly , from the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 3]: `` Mamie ?
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: Have you brought him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 16]: `` It 's I , '' he cried , as he plunged through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 6]: `` It 's Vanrevel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 14]: Mrs. Tanberry set the iron candlestick down upon the table with a crash .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 8]: `` You 've come too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 11]: `` Another man has taken your death on himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 7]: He reeled back against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 6]: `` Oh , God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 9]: `` Oh , God , God , God !
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 3]: Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 13]: `` It 's the poor vagabond that you loved so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 10]: Together they ran through the hall to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 53]: Crailey was lying on the long sofa , his eyes closed , his head like a piece of carven marble , the gay uniform , in which he had tricked himself out so gallantly , open at the throat , and his white linen stained with a few little splotches of red .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 54]: Beside him knelt Miss Betty , holding her lace handkerchief upon his breast ; she was as white as he , and as motionless ; so that , as she knelt there , immovable beside him , her arm like alabaster across his breast , they might have been a sculptor 's group .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 22]: The handkerchief was stained a little , like the linen , and like it , too , stained but a little .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 17]: Nearby , on the floor , stood a flask of brandy and a pitcher of water .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 30]: Miss Betty 's face showed no change , nor even a faint surprise , as her eyes fell upon Tom Vanrevel , but her lips soundlessly framed the word .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 9]: Tom flung himself on his knees beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 4]: `` Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 15]: he cried , in a sharp voice that had a terrible shake in it .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 3]: `` Crailey !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 10]: Crailey , I want you to hear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 22]: He took one of the limp hands in his and began to chafe it , while Mrs. Tanberry grasped the other .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 16]: `` There 's still a movement in the pulse , '' she faltered . . .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 4]: `` Still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 5]: echoed Tom , roughly .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 5]: `` You 're mad !
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 8]: You made me think Crailey was dead !
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 10]: Do you think Crailey Gray is going to die ?
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 18]: He could n't , I tell you -- he could n't ; you do n't know him !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 8]: Who 's gone for the doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 15]: He dashed some brandy upon his handkerchief and set it to the white lips .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 3]: `` Mamie .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 14]: She was here in the room with me when it happened . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 4]: ` Happened ' !
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 5]: ` Happened ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 7]: he mocked her , furiously . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 9]: ` Happened ' is a beautiful word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 6]: `` God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 4]: sobbed Mrs. Tanberry .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 44]: `` I was sitting in the library , and Mamie had just come from you , when we heard Mr. Carewe shout from the cupola room : ` Stand away from my daughter , Vanrevel , and take this like a dog ! '
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 40]: Only that ; -- and Mamie and I ran to the window , and we saw through the dusk a man in uniform leap back from Miss Betty -- they were in that little open space near the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 22]: He called out something and waved his hand , but the shot came at the same time , and he fell .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 28]: Even then I was sure , in spite of what Mamie had said , I was as sure as Robert Carewe was , that it was you .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 23]: He came and took one look -- and saw -- and then Nelson brought the horses and made him mount and go .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 14]: Mamie ran for the doctor , and Betty and I carried Crailey in .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 6]: It was hard work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 17]: Miss Betty 's hand had fallen from Crailey 's breast where Tom 's took its place .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 29]: She rose unsteadily to her feet and pushed back the hair from her forehead , shivering convulsively as she looked down at the motionless figure on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 4]: `` Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 11]: said Tom , in the same angry , shaking voice .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 10]: `` Crailey , you 've got to rouse yourself !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 13]: This wo n't do ; you 've got to be a man !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 3]: Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 13]: He was trying to force the brandy through the tightly clenched teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 4]: `` Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 4]: `` Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 13]: whispered Miss Betty , leaning heavily on the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: `` Crailey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 16]: She looked at Mrs. Tanberry with vague interrogation , but Mrs. Tanberry did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 4]: `` Crailey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 40]: It was then that Crailey 's eyelids fluttered and slowly opened ; and his wandering glance , dull at first , slowly grew clear and twinkling as it rested on the ashy , stricken face of his best friend .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 24]: `` Tom , '' he said , feebly , `` it was worth the price , to wear your clothes just once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 12]: And then , at last , Miss Betty saw and understood .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 70]: For not the honest gentleman , whom everyone except Robert Carewe held in esteem and af-fection , not her father 's enemy , Vanrevel , lay before her with the death-wound in his breast for her sake , but that other -- Crailey Gray , the ne'er - do-weel and light-o ' - love , Crailey Gray , wit , poet , and scapegrace , the well-beloved town scamp .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 21]: He saw that she knew , and , as his brightening eyes wandered up to her , he smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 15]: `` Even a bad dog likes to have his day , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 97]: The Flag Goes Marching By Will Cummings had abandoned the pen for the sword until such time as Santa Anna should cry for quarter , and had left the office in charge of an imported substitute ; but late that night he came to his desk once more , to write the story of the accident to Corporal Gray ; and the tale that he wrote had been already put into writing by Tom Vanrevel as it fell from Crailey 's lips , after the doctor had , come , so that none might doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 6]: No one did doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 10]: What reason had Mr. Carewe to injure Crailey Gray ?
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 45]: Only five in Rouen knew the truth ; for Nelson had gone with his master , and , except Mamie , the other servants of the Carewe household had been among the crowd in front of the Rouen House when the shot was fired .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 118]: So the story went over the town : how Crailey had called to say good-by to Mrs. Tanberry ; how Mr. Carewe happened to be examining the musket his father had carried in 1812 , when the weapon was accidentally discharged , the ball entering Crailey 's breast ; how Mr. Carewe , stricken with remorse and horror over this frightful misfortune , and suffering too severe anguish of mind to remain upon the scene , of the tragedy which his carelessness had made , had fled , attended by his servant ; and how they had leaped aboard the evening boat as it was pulling out , and were now on their way down the river .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 23]: And this was the story , too , that Tom told Fanchon ; for it was he who brought her to Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 57]: Through the long night she knelt at Crailey 's side , his hand always pressed to her breast or cheek , her eyes always upward , and her lips moving with her prayers , not for Crailey to be spared , but that the Father would take good care of him in heaven till she came .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 21]: `` I had already given him up , '' she said to Tom , meekly , in a small voice .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 27]: `` I knew it was to come , and perhaps this way is better than that -- I thought it would be far away from me .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 28]: Now I can be with him , and perhaps I shall have him a little longer , for he was to have gone away before noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 80]: The morning sun rose upon a fair world , gay with bird-chatterings from the big trees of the Carewe place , and pleasant with the odors of Miss Betty 's garden , and Crailey , lying upon the bed of the man who had shot him , hearkened and smiled good-by to the summer he loved ; and , when the day broke , asked that the bed be moved so that he might lie close by the window .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 11]: It was Tom who had borne him to that room .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 17]: `` I have carried him before this , '' he said , waving the others aside .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 54]: Not long after sunrise , when the bed had been moved near the window , Crailey begged Fanchon to bring him a miniature of his mother which he had given her , and urged her to go for it herself ; he wanted no hands but hers to touch it , he said .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 14]: And when she had gone he asked to be left alone with Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 14]: `` Give me your hand , Tom , '' he said , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 14]: `` I 'd like to keep hold of it a minute or so .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 18]: I could n't have said that yesterday , could I , without causing us both horrible embarrassment ?
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 13]: But I fancy I can now , because I 'm done for .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 9]: That 's too bad , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 8]: I 'm very young , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 16]: Do you remember what poor Andre Chenier said as he went up to be guillotined ?
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 12]: -- ' There were things in this head of mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 14]: But I want to tell you what 's been the matter with me .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 11]: It was just my being a bad sort of poet .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 38]: I suppose that I 've never loved anyone ; yet I 've cared more deeply than other men for every lovely thing I ever saw , and there 's so little that has n't loveliness in it .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 41]: I 'd be ashamed not to have cared for the beauty in all the women I 've made love to -- but about this one -- the most beautiful of all -- I -------- '' `` She will understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 5]: said Tom , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 12]: `` She will -- yes -- she 's wise and good .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 24]: If Fanchon knew , there would n't be even a memory left to her -- and I do n't think she 'd live .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 26]: And do you know , I believe I 've done a favor for Miss Betty in getting myself shot ; Carewe will never come back .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 19]: Tom , was ever a man 's knavery so exactly the architect of his own destruction as mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 5]: And for what gain ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: Just the excitement of the comedy from day to day !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 48]: -- for she was sure to despise me as soon as she knew -- and the desire to hear her voice say another kindly thing to me -- and the everlasting perhaps in every woman , and this one the Heart 's Desire of all the world !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 4]: Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 20]: Tell me -- I want to hear it from you -- how many hours does the doctor say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 6]: `` Hours , Crailey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 12]: Tom 's hand twitched pitifully in the other 's feeble grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 10]: `` I know it 's only a few . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 9]: `` They 're all fools , doctors ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 5]: exclaimed Vanrevel , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: And I know that nothing can be done .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 26]: You all see it , and you want me to go easily -- or you would n't let me have my own way so much !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 24]: It frightens me , I own up , to think that so soon I 'll be wiser than the wisest in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 7]: Yet I always wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 47]: I 've sought and I 've sought -- but now to go out alone on the search -- it must be the search , for the Holy Grail -- I -- '' `` Please do n't talk , '' begged Tom , in a broken whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 8]: `` For mercy 's sake , lad .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 7]: It wears on you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 4]: Crailey laughed weakly .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 14]: `` Do you think I could die peacefully without talking a great deal ?
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 9]: There 's one thing I want , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 23]: I want to see all of them once more , all the old friends that are going down the river at noon .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 6]: What harm could it do ?
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 22]: I want them to come by here on their way to the boat , with the band and the new flag .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 9]: But I want the band to play cheerfully !
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 13]: Ask 'em to play ` Rosin the Bow , ' will you ?
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 19]: I 've never believed in mournfulness , and I do n't want to see any of it now .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 8]: It 's the rankest impiety of all !
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 24]: And besides , I want to see them as they 'll be when they come marching home -- they must look gay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 12]: `` Ah , do n't , lad , do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 25]: Tom flung one arm about the other 's shoulder and Crailey was silent , but rested his hand gently on his friend 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 10]: In that attitude Fanchon found them when she came .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 11]: The volunteers gathered at the court-house two hours before noon .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 30]: They met each other dismally , speaking in undertones as they formed in lines of four , while their dispirited faces showed that the heart was out of them .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 21]: Not so with the crowds of country folk and townspeople who lined the streets to see the last of them .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 41]: For these , when the band came marching down the street and took its place , set up a royal cheering that grew louder as Jefferson Bareaud , the color-bearer , carried the flag to the head of the procession .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 29]: With the recruits marched the veterans of 1812 and the Indian wars , the one-legged cobbler stumping along beside General Trumble , who looked very dejected and old .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 45]: The lines stood in silence , and responded to the cheering by quietly removing their hats ; so that the people whispered that it was more like an Odd Fellows ' Sunday funeral than the departure of enthusiastic patriots for the seat of war .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 40]: General Trumble 's was not the only sad face in the ranks ; all were downcast and nervous , even those of the lads from the country , who had not known the comrade they were to leave behind .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 49]: Jefferson unfurled the flag ; Marsh gave the word of command , the band began to play a quick-step , and the procession moved forward down the cheering lane of people , who waved little flags and handkerchiefs and threw their hats in the air as they shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 18]: But , contrary to expectation , the parade was not directly along Main Street to the river .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 4]: `` Right wheel !
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 3]: March ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 18]: commanded Tappingham , hoarsely , waving his sword , and Jefferson led the way into Carewe Street .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 12]: `` For God 's sake , do n't cry now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 19]: and Tappingham , with a large drop streaking down his own cheek , turned savagely upon Lieutenant Cummings .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 8]: `` That is n't what he wants .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 10]: He wants to see us looking cheery and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 12]: We can do it for him this once , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 9]: I never saw him any other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: `` You look damn smiling yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 3]: snuffled Will .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 16]: `` I will when we turn in at the gates , '' retorted his Captain .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 17]: `` On my soul , I swear I 'll kill every sniffling idiot that does n't !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 7]: -- In line , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 8]: he stormed ferociously at a big recruit .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 23]: The lively strains of the band and the shouting of the people grew louder and louder in the room where Crailey lay .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 31]: His eyes glistened as he heard , and he smiled , not the old smile of the worldly prelate , but merrily , like a child when music is heard .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 34]: The room was darkened , save for the light of the one window which fell softly upon his head and breast and upon another fair head close to his , where Fanchon knelt .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 39]: In the shadows at one end of the room were Miss Betty and Mrs. Tanberry and Mrs. Bareaud and the white-haired doctor who had said , `` Let him have his own way in all he asks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 12]: Tom stood alone , close by the head of the couch .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 7]: `` Hail to the band ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 5]: Crailey chuckled , softly .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 8]: `` How the rogues keep the time !
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 11]: It 's ` Rosin the Bow , ' all right !
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 9]: Ah , that is as it should be .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 43]: Mrs. Tanberry , you and I have one thing in common , if you 'll let me flatter myself so far : we 've always believed in good cheer in spite of the devil and all , you and I , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 17]: The best of things , even if things are bad , dear lady , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 6]: `` You darling vagabond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: Mrs. Tanberry murmured , trying to smile back to him .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 6]: `` Hark to 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 3]: said Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 6]: `` They 're very near !
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 7]: Only hear the people cheer them !
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 13]: They 'll ` march away so gaily , ' wo n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 8]: -- and how right that is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 26]: The vanguard appeared in the street , and over the hedge gleamed the oncoming banner , the fresh colors flying out on a strong breeze .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 8]: Crailey greeted it with a breathless cry .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 13]: `` There 's the flag -- look , Fanchon , your flag !
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 2]: -- .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 13]: waving above the hedge ; and it 's Jeff who carries it .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 10]: Does n't it always make you want to dance !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: Bravo , bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 14]: The procession halted for a moment in the street and the music ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 46]: Then , with a jubilant flourish of brass and the roll of drums , the band struck up `` The Star Spangled Banner , '' and Jefferson Bareaud proudly led the way through the gates and down the driveway , the bright silk streaming overhead .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 33]: Behind him briskly marched the volunteers , with heads erect and cheerful faces , as they knew Corporal Gray wished to see them , their Captain flourishing his sword in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 5]: `` Here they come !
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 7]: Do you see , Fanchon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 5]: cried Crailey , excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 39]: `` They are all there , Jeff and Tappingham , and the two Madrillons and Will , the dear old fellow -- he 'll never write a decent paragraph as long as he lives , God bless him !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 14]: -- and young Frank -- what deviltries I 've led the boy into !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 16]: -- and there 's the old General , forgetting all the tiffs we 've had .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 12]: God bless them all and grant them all a safe return !
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 11]: What on earth are they taking off their hats for ?
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 10]: -- Ah , good-by , boys , good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 23]: They saw the white face at the window , and the slender hand fluttering its farewell , and Tappingham halted his men .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 9]: `` Three times three for Corporal Gray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 15]: he shouted , managing , somehow , to keep the smile upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 19]: `` Three times three , and may he rejoin his company before we enter the Mexican capital ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 46]: He beat the time for the thunderous cheers that they gave ; the procession described a circle on the lawn , and then , with the band playing and colors flying , passed out of the gates and took up the march to the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 8]: `` The flag , the flag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 9]: whispered Crailey , following it with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 16]: `` It shows that you helped make it , Fanchon , it 's so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 36]: Ah , Tom , they 've said we abused it , sometimes -- it was only that we loved it so well we did n't like to see anyone make it look silly or mean .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 23]: But , after all , no man can do that -- no , nor no group of men , nor party ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 18]: His voice grew louder as the last strains of the music came more faintly from the street .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 29]: `` They 'll take your banner across the Rio Grande , Fanchon , but that is not all -- some day its stars must spread over the world !
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 10]: Do n't you all see that they will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 30]: After a little while , he closed his eyes with a sigh ; the doctor bent over him quickly , and Miss Betty started forward unconsciously and cried out .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 19]: But the bright eyes opened again and fixed themselves upon her with all their old , gay inscrutability .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 8]: `` Not yet , '' said Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 20]: `` Miss Carewe , may I tell you that I am sorry I could not have known you sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 19]: Perhaps you might have liked me for Fanchon 's sake -- I know you care for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 8]: `` I do -- I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 3]: she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 9]: `` I love her , and -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 25]: -- I do like you , Mr. Gray , for I know you , though I never -- met you until -- last night .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 9]: God bless you -- God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 19]: She wavered a moment , like a lily in the wind , and put out a hand blindly .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 5]: `` Not you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 11]: she said sharply , as Tom Vanrevel started toward her .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 20]: Mrs. Tanberry came quickly and put an arm about her , and together they went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 21]: `` You must be good to her , Tom , '' said Crailey then , in a very low voice .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 5]: answered Tom , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 12]: `` There was never a chance of that , lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 7]: `` Listen , '' whispered Crailey .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 9]: `` Lean down -- no -- closer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 52]: He cast a quick glance at Fanchon , kneeling at the other side of the bed , her golden head on the white coverlet , her outstretched hand clutching his ; and he spoke so close to Tom 's ear and in so low a tone that only Tom could hear .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 7]: `` She never cared for me .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 18]: She felt that she ought to -- but that was only because I masqueraded in your history .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 17]: She wanted to tell me before I went away that there was no chance for me .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 13]: She was telling me that , when he called from the window .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 14]: It was at the dance , the night before , that she knew .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 17]: I think there has been someone else from the first -- God send it 's you !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 13]: Did you speak to her that night or she to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 10]: `` Ah , no , '' said Tom Vanrevel .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 6]: `` All the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 36]: Mrs. Tanberry and Betty and Mr. Bareaud waited in the library , the two women huddled together on a sofa , with their arms round each other , and all the house was very still .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 25]: By and by , they heard a prolonged , far-away cheering and the steamer 's whistle , and knew that the boat was off .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 35]: Half an hour later , Will Cummings came back alone , entered the room on tip-toe , and silently sank into a chair near Mr. Bareaud , with his face away from Miss Betty .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 16]: He was to remain in Rouen another week , and join his regiment with Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 29]: None of the three appeared to notice his coming more than dimly , and he sat with his face bowed in his hands , and did not move .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 66]: Thus perhaps an hour passed , with only a sound of footsteps on the gravel of the driveway , now and then , and a low murmur of voices in the rear of the house where people came to ask after Crailey ; and when the door of the room where he lay was opened , the four watchers started as at a loud explosion .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 25]: It was Mrs. Bareaud and the old doctor , and they closed the door again , softly , and came in to the others .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 18]: They had left Crailey alone with Fanchon and Tom Vanrevel , the two who loved him best .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 42]: The warm day beyond the windows became like Sunday , no voices sounded from without in the noon hush , though sometimes a little group of people would gather across the street to eye the house curiously and nod and whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 48]: The strong , blue shadows of the veranda pillars stole slowly across the white floor of the porch in a lessening slant , and finally lay all in a line , as the tall clock in a corner of the library asthmatically coughed the hour of noon .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 12]: In this jarring discordance there was something frightful to Miss Betty .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 57]: She rose abruptly , and , imperiously waving back Mrs. Tanberry , who would have detained her -- for there was in her face and manner the incipient wildness of control overstrained to the breaking-point -- she went hurriedly out of the room and out of the house , to the old bench in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 24]: There she sank down , her face hidden in her arms ; there on the spot where she had first seen Crailey Gray .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 35]: From there , too , had risen the serenade of the man she had spurned and insulted ; and there she had come to worship the stars when Crailey bade her look to them .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 27]: And now the strange young teacher was paying the bitter price for his fooleries -- and who could doubt that the price was a bitter one ?
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 97]: To have the spirit so suddenly , cruelly riven from the sprightly body that was , but a few hours ago , hale and alert , obedient to every petty wish , could dance , run , and leap ; to be forced with such hideous precipitation to leave the warm breath of June and undergo the lonely change , merging with the shadow ; to be flung from the exquisite and commonplace day of sunshine into the appalling adventure that should not have been his for years -- and hurled into it by what hand !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 11]: -- ah , bitter , bitter price for a harlequinade !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 6]: And , alas , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 5]: for the brave harlequin !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 18]: A gentle touch fell upon her shoulder , and Miss Betty sprang to her feet and screamed .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 17]: It was Nelson who stood before her , hat in hand , his head deeply bowed .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 7]: `` Is he with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 10]: she cried , clutching at the bench for support .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 12]: `` No 'm , '' answered the old man , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 17]: `` I reckon we all ain ' goin ' see dat man no mo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 12]: `` On de way , honey , on de way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: `` The way -- to Rouen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 13]: `` No 'm ; he goin ' cross de big water . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 12]: He stretched out his hand and pointed solemnly to the east .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 23]: `` Him an ' me we cotch de boat , an ' yo ' pa mek 'em taken de hosses on bode .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 111]: Den we git off at Leeville , five mile ' down de rivuh , an ' yo ' pa hol ' de boat whiles I rid back alone an ' git de news , an ' what de tale is you all is tole , f ` um ole Mist ' Chen ` eth ; an ' Mist ' Chen ` eth , he rid back wid me an ' see yo ' pa at Leeville , an ' dey talk in de shed by de landin ' , an ' yo ' pa tell Mist ' Chen ` eth what ` rangements he goin ' make wid de proprety .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 38]: ` Den he git on de boat ag ` in an ' dey sto ' t her agoin ' ; an ' he ain ' wave no good-by , ner say no mo ' wu ` ds .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 45]: Mist ' Chen ` eth rid back whens de light come ; but I res ' de hosses an ' come back slow , ` case I ponduh on de worl ' , an ' I mighty sorry fer yo ' pa , Missy .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 31]: He am ' comin ' back no mo ' , honey , an ' Miz Tanberry an ' me an ' Mamie , we goin ' take keer er you .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 18]: Yo ' pa gone back dah to de F'enchmun , whuh he ` uz a young man .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 24]: He mighty sick , an ' he scairt , honey ; an ' he ain ' goin ' git ovah dat , neider .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 40]: ` Peah to me , Missy , like he done had a vizhum er he own soul , when he come an ' look down at dat young man layin ' on de grass , las ' night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 39]: The old fellow bent his back before her in a solemn bow , as a feudal retainer in allegiance to the heir , but more in deference to the sorrow written upon her , and respecting its magnitude .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 34]: With no words of comfort , for he knew she wanted only to be alone , he moved away , with infirm steps and shaking head , toward the rear of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 15]: Miss Betty threw herself upon the bench again , face downward in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 11]: And still the house lay in silence under the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 51]: An hour had passed , and the shadows slanted strongly to the east , when the stillness was broken by a sound , low and small at first , then rising fearfully , a long , quavering wail of supreme anguish , that clutched and shook the listener 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 40]: No one could have recognized the voice as Fanchon 's , yet everyone who heard it knew that it was hers ; and that the soul of Crailey Gray had gone out upon the quest for the Holy Grail .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 35]: Miss Betty 's hands clenched convulsively round the arm of the bench and a fit of shuddering seized her as if with the grip of a violent chill , though her eyes were dry .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 5]: Then she lay quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 37]: A long time afterward , she became aware of a step that paced the garden path behind her , and turned her face upon her arm so that she saw , but made no other motion .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 26]: It was Tom Vanrevel , walking slowly up and down , his hands behind his back and his hat pulled far down over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 6]: He had not seen her .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 7]: She rose and spoke his name .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 7]: He turned and came to her .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 45]: `` Almost at the very last , '' he said , `` Crailey whispered to me that he knew you thought him a great scamp , but to tell you to be sure to remember that it was all true about the stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 57]: `` Goodby '' It was between twilight and candlelight , the gentle half-hour when the kind old Sand Man steals up the stairs of houses where children are ; when rustic lovers stroll with slow and quiet steps down country lanes , and old bachelors are loneliest and dream of the things that might have been .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 57]: Through the silence of the clear dusk came the whistle of the evening boat that was to bear Tom Vanrevel through the first stage of his long journey to the front of war , and the sound fell cheerlessly upon Miss Betty 's ear , as she stood leaning against the sun-dial among the lilac bushes .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 40]: Her attitude was not one of reverie ; yet she stood very still , so still that , in the wan shimmer of the faded afterglow , one might have passed close by her and not have seen her .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 81]: The long , dark folds of her gown showed faintly against the gray stone , and her arms , bare from the elbow , lay across the face of the dial with unrelaxed fingers clenching the cornice ; her head drooping , not languidly but with tension , her eyes half-closed , showing the lashes against a pale cheek ; and thus , motionless , leaning on the stone in the dusk , she might have been Sorrow 's self .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 34]: She did not move , there was not even a flicker of the eyelashes , when a step sounded on the gravel of the driveway , and Vanrevel came slowly from the house .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 13]: He stopped at a little distance from her , hat in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 48]: He was very thin , worn and old-looking , and in the failing light might have been taken for a tall , gentle ghost ; yet his shoulders were squared and he held himself as straight as he had the first time she had ever seen him .
