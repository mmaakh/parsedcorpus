Parsing [sent. 1 len. 7]: Percival Keene , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 15]: Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792 , and died August 8 1848 .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 16]: He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to writing .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 31]: In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books , many of which are among the very best of English literature , and some of which are still in print .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 24]: He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day 's work , he never knew what he was going to write .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: He certainly was a literary genius .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 19]: `` Percival Keene '' was published in 1842 , the nineteenth book to flow from Marryat 's pen .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 21]: This e-text was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson , and was reformatted in 2003 , and again in 2005 .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 8]: PERCIVAL KEENE , BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 33]: A few miles from the town of Southampton there is an old mansion-house , which has been for centuries known as Madeline Hall , in the possession of the de Versely family .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 36]: It is a handsome building , surrounded by a finely timbered park of some extent , and , what is more important , by about 12,000 acres of land , which also appertain to it .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 57]: At the period in which I commence this history , there resided in this mansion an elderly spinster of rank , named the Honourable Miss Delmar , sister of the late Lord de Versely and aunt to the present earl , and an Honourable Captain Delmar , who was the second son of the deceased nobleman .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 19]: This property belonged to the Honourable Miss Delmar , and was at her entire disposal upon her decease .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 73]: The Honourable Captain Delmar , at the time I am speaking of , commanded a frigate employed upon what was designated channel service , which in those days implied that the captain held a seat in the House of Commons and that he voted with the ministry ; and further , that his vote might , when required , be forthcoming , the frigate was never sea-going , except during the recess .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 78]: It must be admitted that H.M. ship Paragon did occasionally get under weigh and remain cruising in sight of land for two or three days , until the steward reported that the milk provided for the captain 's table was turning sour ; upon which important information the helm was immediately put up , and the frigate , in a case of such extreme distress , would drop her anchor at the nearest port under her lee .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 41]: Now as the Paragon was constantly at Spithead , Captain Delmar was very attentive in visiting his aunt , who lived at Madeline Hall ; ill-natured people asserted , because she had so fine an estate in her own gift .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 39]: Certain it is , that he would remain there for weeks , which gave great satisfaction to the old lady , who liked her nephew , liked attention , and was even so peculiar as to like sailors .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 88]: But it must be observed that there was another person at the mansion who also liked the captain , liked attention , and liked sailors ; this was Miss Arabella Mason , a very pretty young woman of eighteen years of age , who constantly looked in the glass merely to ascertain if she had ever seen a face which she preferred to her own , and who never read any novel without discovering that there was a remarkable likeness between the heroine and her pretty self .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 61]: Miss Arabella Mason was the eldest daughter of the steward of the old Lord de Versely , brother to the Honourable Miss Delmar , and was much respected by his lordship for his fidelity and his knowledge of business , in the transaction of which he fell , for he was felling trees , and a tree fell upon him .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 33]: He left a widow and two daughters : it was said that at his death Mrs Mason was not badly off , as her husband had been very careful of his earnings .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 75]: Mrs Mason , however , did not corroborate this statement ; on the contrary , she invariably pleaded poverty ; and the Honourable Miss Delmar , after Lord de Versely 's death -- which happened soon after that of his steward -- sent both the daughters to be educated at a country school , where , as everything that is taught is second-rate , young ladies , of course , receive a second-rate education .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 34]: Mrs Mason was often invited by the Honourable Miss Delmar to spend a month at Madeline Hall , and used to bring her eldest daughter , who had left school , with her .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 20]: Latterly , however , the daughter remained as a fixture , and Mrs Mason received but an occasional invitation .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 120]: It may be inquired in what capacity Miss Arabella Mason remained at the Hall ; she was not a servant , for her position in life was above that of a menial ; neither was she received altogether in the saloon , as she was of too humble a grade to mix with gentry and nobility ; she was , therefore , betwixt and between , a sort of humble companion in the drawing-room , a cut above the housekeeper in the still-room , a fetcher and carrier of the honourable spinster 's wishes , a sort of link between the aristocratic old dame and her male attendants , towards whom she had a sort of old maidish aversion .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 53]: However this position might be found useful to her mistress , it must be admitted that it was a most unfortunate position for a young , thoughtless , and very pretty girl , moreover , who was naturally very lively , very smart in repartee , and very fond of being admired .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 31]: As the Honourable Captain Delmar was very constant in his visits to his aunt , it was but natural that he should pay some little attention to her humble companion .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 61]: By degrees the intimacy increased , and at last there were reports in the servants ' hall , that the captain and Miss Bella Mason had been seen together in the evergreen walk ; and as the captain 's visits were continually repeated during the space of two years so did the scandal increase , and people became more ill-natured .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 50]: It was now seen that Miss Bella had been very often found in tears , and the old butler and the older housekeeper shook their heads at each other like responsive mandarins ; the only person who was ignorant of the scandal afloat was the old lady spinster herself .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 7]: I must now introduce another personage .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 35]: The Honourable Captain Delmar did not , of course , travel without his valet , and this important personage had been selected out of the marine corps which had been drafted into the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 59]: Benjamin Keene , for such was his name , was certainly endowed with several qualities which were indispensable in a valet ; he was very clean in his person , very respectful in his deportment , and , after the sovereign of Great Britain , looked upon the Honourable Captain Delmar as the greatest person in the world .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 50]: Moreover , Benjamin Keene , although only a private marine was , without exception , one of the handsomest men that ever was seen and being equally as well made and well drilled as he was handsome in person , he was the admiration of all the young women .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 65]: But Nature , who delights in a drawback , had contrived to leave him almost without brains ; and further , he was wholly uneducated -- for he was too stupid to learn -- his faculties were just sufficient to enable him , by constant drilling , to be perfect in the manual exercise , and mechanically to perform his duties as a valet .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 28]: Ben always accompanied his master to the hall , where the former was at one and the same time the admiration and laughter of all the servants .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 112]: It hardly need be observed , that the clever and sprightly Miss Arabella Mason considered Ben as one much beneath her , that is , she said so on his first arrival at Madeline hall ; but , strange to say , that two years afterwards , just at the time that reports had been raised that she had been frequently discovered in tears , there was a change in her manner towards him ; indeed some people insinuated that she was setting her cap at the handsome marine : this idea , it is true , was ridiculed by the majority ; but still the intimacy appeared rapidly to increase .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 51]: It was afterwards asserted by those who find out everything after it has taken place , that Ben would never have ventured to look up to such an unequal match had he not been prompted to it by his master , who actually proposed that he should marry the girl .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 63]: That such was the fact is undoubted , although they knew it not ; and Ben , who considered the wish of his captain as tantamount to an order , as soon as he could comprehend what his captain required of him , stood up erect and raised his hand with a flourish to his head , in token of his obedience .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 53]: Shortly afterwards , Captain Delmar again came over to Madeline Hall , accompanied as usual , by Ben , and the second day after their arrival it was made known to all whom it might concern , that Miss Arabella Mason had actually contracted a secret marriage with the handsome Benjamin Keene .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 29]: Of course , the last person made acquainted with this interesting intelligence was the Honourable Miss Delmar , and her nephew took upon himself to make the communication .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 30]: At first the honourable spinster bridled up with indignation , wondered at the girl 's indelicacy , and much more at her demeaning herself by marrying a private marine .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 26]: Captain Delmar replied , that it was true that Ben was only a private , but that every common soldier was a gentleman by profession .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 35]: It was true that Bella Mason might have done better -- but she was his aunt 's servant , and Keene was his valet , so that the disparity was not so very great .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 36]: He then intimated that he had long perceived the growing attachment ; talked of the danger of young people being left so much together ; hinted about opportunity , and descanted upon morals and propriety .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 63]: The Honourable Miss Delmar was softened down by the dexterous reasoning of her nephew ; she was delighted to find so much virtue extant in a sailor ; and , after an hour 's conversation , the married couple were sent for , graciously pardoned , and Mrs Keene , after receiving a very tedious lecture , received a very handsome present .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 14]: But if her mistress was appeased , Mrs Keene 's mother was not .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 17]: As soon as the intelligence was received , old Mrs Mason set off for Madeline Hall .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 85]: She first had a closeted interview with her daughter , and then with Captain Delmar , and as soon as the latter was over , she immediately took her departure , without paying her respects to the mistress of the Hall , or exchanging one word with any of the servants ; this conduct gave occasion to more innuendoes -- some indeed ascribed her conduct to mortification at her daughter 's having made so imprudent a match , but others exchanged very significant glances .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 31]: Three weeks after the marriage , the Parliament having been prorogued , the admiral of the port considered that he was justified in ordering the frigate out on a cruise .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 26]: Ben Keene , of course accompanied his master , and it was not until three months had passed away that the frigate returned into port .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 33]: As usual , the Honourable Captain Delmar , as soon as he had paid his respects to the admiral , set off to visit his aunt , accompanied by his benedict marine .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 47]: On his arrival , he found that everything appeared to be in great confusion ; indeed an event was occurring which had astonished the whole household ; the butler made a profound bow to the captain ; the footmen forgot their usual smirk when he alighted .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 45]: Captain Delmar was ushered in solemn silence into the drawing-room , and his aunt , who had notice of his arrival received him with a stiff , prim air of unwonted frigidity , with her arms crossed before her on her white muslin apron .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 25]: `` My dear aunt , '' said Captain Delmar , as she coldly took his proffered hand , `` what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 34]: `` The matter is this , nephew , '' replied the old lady -- `` that marriage of your marine and Bella Mason should have taken place six months sooner than it did .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 40]: This is a wicked world , nephew ; and sailors , I 'm afraid , are -- '' `` Marines , you should say , in this instance , my dear aunt , '' replied Captain Delmar , insinuatingly .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 26]: `` I must confess that neither sailors nor marines are quite so strict as they ought to be ; however , Ben has married her .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 30]: Come , my dear aunt , allow me to plead for them , although I am very much distressed that such an event should take place in your house .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 36]: I think , '' added he , after a pause , `` I shall give Mr Keene seven dozen at the gangway , for his presumption , as soon as I return on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 15]: `` That wo n't mend the matter , nephew , '' replied Miss Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 18]: `` I 'll turn her out of the house as soon as she can be moved . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 20]: `` And I 'll flog him as soon as I get him on board , '' rejoined the captain .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 50]: `` I will not have your feelings shocked , and your mind harassed in this way , by any impropriety on the part of my followers -- most infamous -- shameful -- abominable -- unpardonable , '' interjected the captain , walking the quarter-deck up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 27]: The Honourable Miss Delmar continued to talk , and the honourable captain to agree with her in all she said , for an hour at least .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 30]: When people are allowed to give vent to their indignation without the smallest opposition they soon talk it away ; such was the case with the Honourable Miss Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 182]: When it was first announced that Bella Keene was safely in bed with a fine boy , the offended spinster turned away from the communication with horror ; when her own maid ventured to remark that it was a lovely baby , she was ordered to hold her tongue ; she would not see the suffering mother , and the horrid marine was commanded to stay in the kitchen , lest she should be contaminated by meeting him on the stairs ; but every day softened down her indignation , and before a fortnight was over the Honourable Miss Delmar had not only seen but admired the baby ; and at last decided upon paying a visit to the mother , who was now sufficiently recovered to undergo a lecture of about two hours ' length , in which the honourable spinster commented upon her _ in_decency , _ in_discretion , _ in_considerateness , _ in_correctness , _ in_decorum , _ in_continence , and _ in_delicacy ; pointing out that her conduct was most inexcusable , iniquitous , and most infamous .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 22]: The Honourable Miss Delmar having had such a long innings then gave it up , because she was out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 119]: Bella , who waited patiently to make her response , and who was a very clever girl , then declared , with many tears , that she was aware that her conduct was _ in_excusable , her faults had been _ in_voluntary , and her sorrow was _ in_expressible ; her _ in_experience and her _ in_fatuation her only apology ; that her _ in_felicity at her mistress 's displeasure would _ in_evitably increase her sufferings ; assured her that she was not _ in_corrigible , and that if her mistress would only indulge her with forgiveness , as she hoped to _ in_herit heaven she would never _ in_cur her anger by committing the same fault again .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 38]: Satisfied with this assurance , the Honourable Miss Delmar softened down , and not only forgave , but actually took the child into her lap that Bella might read the Bible which she had presented her with .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 59]: Reader , the child who had this great honour conferred upon him , who actually laid in the immaculate lap , on the apron of immaculate snowy whiteness of the immaculate Honourable Miss Delmar , was no other person than the narrator of this history -- or , if you please it , the Hero of this Tale .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 48]: That my mother had so far smoothed things pretty well must be acknowledged ; but it was to be presumed that her husband might not be pleased at so unusual an occurrence , and already the sneers and innuendoes of the servants ' hall were not wanting .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 72]: It appeared , however , that an interview had taken place between Ben and Captain Delmar shortly after my making my appearance : what occurred did not transpire , but this is certain that , upon the marine 's return to the kitchen , one of the grooms , who ventured to banter him , received such a sound thrashing from Ben that it put an end to all further joking .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 52]: As Ben had taken up the affair so seriously , it was presumed that if there had been anticipation of the hymeneal rites he was himself the party who had been hasty ; and that now he was married , he was resolved to resent any impertinent remarks upon his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 52]: At all events , the question now became one of less interest , as the scandal was of less importance ; and as Ben had made known his determination to resent any remarks upon the subject , not a word more was said , at all events when he was present .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 76]: In due time I was christened , and so completely was my mother reinstalled in the good graces of her mistress , that as Captain Delmar had volunteered to stand my sponsor , the Honourable Miss Delmar gave the necessary female security ; at the particular request of my mother , the captain consented that I should bear his own Christian name , and I was duly registered in the church books as Percival Keene .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 8]: There is no security in this world .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 73]: A dissolution of Parliament took place , and on the following election the Honourable Captain Delmar 's constituents , not being exactly pleased at the total indifference which he had shown to their interests , took upon themselves to elect another member in his stead , who , as Captain Delmar had previously done , promised everything , and in all probability would follow the honourable captain 's example by performing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 44]: The loss of his election was followed up by the loss of his ship , his majesty 's government not considering it necessary that Captain Delmar -LRB- now that he had leisure to attend to his professional duties -RRB- should retain his command .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 20]: The frigate , therefore , was paid off , and recommissioned by another captain who had friends in Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 95]: As Ben Keene belonged to the marine corps , he could not , of course , remain as valet to Captain Delmar , but was ordered , with the rest of the detachment , to the barracks at Chatham ; my mother , although she was determined that she would not live at barracks , was not sorry to leave the Hall , where she could not fail to perceive that she was , from her imprudent conduct , no longer treated with the respect or cordiality to which she had been previously accustomed .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 54]: She was most anxious to quit a place in which her disgrace was so well known ; and Captain Delmar having given her his advice , which coincided with her own ideas , and also a very munificent present to enable her to set up housekeeping , took his departure from the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 34]: My mother returned to her room as the wheels of his carriage rattled over the gravel of the drive , and many were the bitter tears which she shed over her unconscious boy .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 35]: The following day the Honourable Miss Delmar sent for her ; as usual , commenced with a tedious lecture , which , as before , was wound up at parting with a handsome present .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 33]: The day after my mother packed up her trunks , and with me in her arms set off to Chatham , where we arrived safely , and immediately went into furnished lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 39]: My mother was a clever , active woman , and the presents which she had at different times received amounted to a considerable sum of money , over which her husband had never ventured to assert any claim .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 19]: Indeed , I must do Ben Keene the justice to say that he had the virtue of humility .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 27]: He felt that his wife was in every way his superior and that it was only under peculiar circumstances that he could have aspired to her .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 27]: He was , therefore , submissive to her in everything , consenting to every proposal that was made by her , and guided by her opinion .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 80]: When , therefore , on her arrival at Chatham , she pointed out how impossible it would be for one brought up as she had been to associate with the women in the barracks , and that she considered it advisable that she should set up some business by which she might gain a respectable livelihood , Ben , although he felt that this would be a virtual separation _ a mensa et thoro _ , named no objections .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 69]: Having thus obtained the consent of her husband , who considered her so much his superior as to be infallible , my mother , after much cogitation , resolved that she would embark her capital in a circulating library and stationer 's shop ; for she argued that selling paper , pens , and sealing-wax was a commerce which would secure to her customers of the better class .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 113]: Accordingly , she hired a house close to the barracks , with a very good-sized shop below , painting and papering it very smartly ; there was much taste in all her arrangements , and although the expenses of the outlay and the first year 's rent had swallowed up a considerable portion of the money she had laid by , it soon proved that she had calculated well , and her shop became a sort of lounge for the officers , who amused themselves with her smartness and vivacity , the more so as she had a talent for repartee , which men like to find in a very pretty woman .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 33]: In a short time my mother became quite the rage , and it was a mystery how so pretty and elegant a person could have become the wife of a private marine .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 33]: It was however , ascribed to her having been captivated with the very handsome person and figure of her husband , and having yielded to her feelings in a moment of infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 15]: The ladies patronised her circulating library ; the officers and gentlemen purchased her stationery .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 44]: My mother then added gloves , perfumery , canes , and lastly cigars , to her previous assortment and before she had been a year in business , found that she was making money very fast , and increasing her customers every day .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 77]: My mother had a great deal of tact ; with the other sex she was full of merriment and fond of joking , consequently a great favourite ; towards her own sex her conduct was quite the reverse ; she assumed a respectful , prudish air , blended with a familiarity which was never offensive ; she was , therefore , equally popular with her own sex , and prospered in every sense of the word .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 31]: Had her husband been the least inclined to have asserted his rights , the position which she had gained was sufficient to her reducing him to a state of subjection .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 122]: She had raised herself , unaided , far above him ; he saw her continually chatting and laughing with his own officers , to whom he was compelled to make a respectful salute whenever they passed by him ; he could not venture to address her , or even to come into the shop , when his officers were there , or it would have been considered disrespectful towards them ; and as he could not sleep out of barracks , all his intercourse with her was to occasionally slink down by the area , to find something better to eat than he could have in his own mess , or obtain from her an occasional shilling to spend in beer .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 64]: Ben , the marine , found at last that somehow or another , his wife had slipped out of his hands ; that he was nothing more than a pensioner on her bounty a slave to her wishes , and a fetcher and carrier at her command , and he resigned himself quietly to his fate , as better men have done before .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 21]: I think that the reader will agree with me that my mother showed in her conduct great strength of character .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 32]: She had been compelled to marry a man whom she despised , and to whom she felt herself superior in every respect ; she had done so to save her reputation .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 126]: That she had been in error is true but situation and opportunity had conspired against her ; and when she found out the pride and selfishness of the man to whom she was devoted , and for whom she had sacrificed so much , -- when her ears were wounded by proposals from his lips that she should take such a step to avoid the scandal arising from their intimacy -- when at the moment that he made such a proposition , and the veil fell down and revealed the heart of man in its selfishness , it is not to be wondered that , with bitter tears , arising from wounded love , anger , and despair at her hopeless position , she consented .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 15]: After having lost all she valued , what did she care for the future ?
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 18]: It was but one sacrifice more to make , one more proof of her devotion and obedience .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: But there are few women who , like my mother , would have recovered her position to the extent that she did .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 48]: Had she not shown such determination , had she consented to have accompanied her husband to the barracks , and have mixed up with the other wives of the men , she would have gradually sunk down to their level ; to this she could not consent .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 48]: Having once freed herself from her thraldom , he immediately sunk down to his level , as she rose up to a position in which , if she could not ensure more than civility and protection , she was at all events secure from insult and ill-treatment .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 41]: Such was the state of affairs when I had arrived at the important age of six years , a comic-looking , laughing urchin , petted by the officers , and as fall of mischief as a tree full of monkeys .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 46]: My mother 's business had so much increased , that , about a year previous to this date , she had found it necessary to have some one to assist her , and had decided upon sending for her sister Amelia to live with her .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 13]: It was , however , necessary to obtain her mother 's consent .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 28]: My grandmother had never seen my mother since the interview which she had had with her at Madeline Hall shortly after her marriage with Ben the marine .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 65]: Latterly , however , they had corresponded ; for my mother , who was too independent to seek her mother when she was merely the wife of a private marine , now that she was in flourishing circumstances had first tendered the olive branch , which had been accepted , as soon as my grandmother found that she was virtually separated from her husband .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 55]: As my grandmother found it rather lonely at the isolated house in which she resided , and Amelia declared herself bored to death , it was at last agreed that my grandmother and my aunt Amelia should both come and take up their residence with my mother , and in due time they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 42]: Milly , as my aunt was called , was three years younger than my mother , very pretty and as smart as her sister , perhaps a little more demure in her look , but with more mischief in her disposition .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 25]: My grandmother was a cross , spiteful old woman ; she was very large in her person , but very respectable in her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 31]: I need not say that Miss Amelia did not lessen the attraction at the circulating library , which after her arrival was even more frequented by the officers than before .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 34]: My aunt Milly was very soon as fond of me as I was of mischief ; indeed it is not to be wondered at , for I was a type of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 18]: I soon loved her better than my mother , for she encouraged me in all my tricks .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 132]: My mother looked grave , and occasionally scolded me ; my grandmother slapped me hard and rated me continually ; but reproof or correction from the two latter were of no avail ; and the former , when she wished to play any trick which she dared not do herself , employed me as her agent ; so that I obtained the whole credit for what were her inventions , and I may safely add , underwent the whole blame and punishment ; but that I cared nothing for ; her caresses , cakes , and sugar-plums , added to my natural propensity , more than repaid me for the occasional severe rebukes of my mother , and the vindictive blows I received from the long fingers of my worthy grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 34]: Moreover , the officers took much notice of me , and it must be admitted , that , although I positively refused to learn my letters , I was a very forward child .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 64]: My great patron was a Captain Bridgeman , a very thin , elegantly-made man , who was continually performing feats of address and activity ; occasionally I would escape with him and go down to the mess , remain at dinner , drink toasts , and , standing on the mess-table , sing two or three comic songs which he had taught me .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 44]: I sometimes returned a little merry with the bumpers , which made my mother very angry , my old grandmother to hold up her hands , and look at the ceiling through her spectacles , and my aunt Milly as merry as myself .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 74]: Before I was eight years old , I had become so notorious , that any prank played in the town , any trick undiscovered , was invariably laid to my account ; and many were the applications made to my mother for indemnification for broken windows and other damage done , too often , I grant , with good reason , but very often when I had been perfectly innocent of the misdemeanour .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 33]: At last I was voted a common nuisance , and every one , except my mother and my aunt Milly , declared that it was high time that I went to school .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 16]: One evening the whole of the family were seated at tea in the back parlour .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 86]: I was sitting very quietly and demurely in a corner , a sure sign that I was in mischief , and so indeed I was -LRB- for I was putting a little gunpowder into my grandmother 's snuff-box , which I had purloined , just that she might `` smell powder , '' as they say at sea , without danger of life or limb -RRB- , when the old woman addressed my mother -- `` Bella , is that boy never going to school ?
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 9]: it will be the ruin of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 12]: `` What will be the ruin of him , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 11]: rejoined my aunt Milly ; `` going to school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 20]: `` Hold your nonsense , child : you are as bad as the boy himself , '' replied granny .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 13]: `` Boys are never ruined by education ; girls sometimes are . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 29]: Whether my mother thought that this was an innuendo reflecting upon any portion of her own life , I can not tell ; but she replied very tartly .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 21]: `` You 're none the worse for my education , mother , or you would not be sitting here . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 37]: `` Very true , child , '' replied granny ; `` but recollect , neither would you have married a marine -- a private marine , Bella , while your sister looks up to the officers .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 47]: Ay , '' continued the old woman , leaving off her knitting and looking at her daughter , `` and is likely to get one , too , if she plays her cards well -- that Lieutenant Flat ca n't keep out of the shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 66]: -LRB- My granny having at this moment given me an opportunity to replace her snuff-box , I did not fail to profit by it ; and as I perceived her knitting-pin had dropped on the floor , I stuck it into the skirt of her gown behind , so that whenever she looked for it , it was certain ever to be behind her . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 19]: `` Mr Flat is of a very respectable family , I hear say , '' continued my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 11]: `` And a great fool , '' interrupted my mother .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 11]: `` I hope Milly wo n't listen to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 17]: `` He 's an officer , '' replied my granny , `` not a private . ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 44]: `` Well , mother , I prefer my private marine , for I can make him do as I please ; if he 's a private , I 'm commanding officer , and intend so to be as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 25]: `` Well , well , Bella , let us say no more on the old score ; but that boy must go to school .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 10]: Deary me , I have dropped my needle . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 40]: My grandmother rose , and turned round and round , looking for her needle , which , strange to say , she could not find ; she opened her snuff-box , and took a pinch to clear her optics .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 14]: `` Deary me , why , what 's the matter with my snuff ?
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 7]: and where can that needle be ?
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 19]: Child , come and look for the needle ; do n't be sticking there in that corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 17]: I thought proper to obey the order and pretended to be very diligent in my search .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 45]: Catching aunt Milly 's eye , I pointed to the knitting-needle sticking in the hind skirts of my grandmother 's gown , and then was down on my knees again , while my aunt held her handkerchief to her mouth to check her laughter .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 37]: A minute afterwards , Ben the marine first tapped gently , and then opened the door and came in ; for at that late hour the officers were all at dinner , and the shop empty .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 43]: `` There are three parcels of books for you to take , '' said my mother ; `` but you 've plenty of time , so take down the tea-things , and get your tea in the kitchen before you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 13]: `` You have n't got a shilling , Bella , about you ?
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 15]: I want some ` baccy , '' said Ben , in his quiet way .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 23]: `` Yes , here 's a shilling , Ben ; but do n't drink too much beer , '' replied my mother .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 13]: `` Deary me , what can have become of my needle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 7]: exclaimed my grandmother , turning round .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 19]: `` Here it is , ma'am , '' said Ben , who perceived it sticking in her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 14]: `` That 's Percival 's work , I 'll answer for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 29]: My granny received the needle from Ben , and then turned to me : `` You good-for-nothing boy ; so you put the needle there , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 22]: pretending to look for it all the while ; you shall go to school , sir , that you shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 32]: `` You said a needle , granny ; I was looking for a needle : you did n't say your knitting-pin ; I could have told you where that was . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 26]: `` Yes , yes , those who hide can find ; to school you go , or I 'll not stay in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 9]: Ben took the tea-tray out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 11]: He had been well drilled in and out of barracks .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 23]: `` I 'll go down in the kitchen to father , '' cried I , for I was tired of sitting still .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 70]: `` No , you wo n't , sir , '' said my mother , `` you naughty boy ; the kitchen is not the place for you , and if ever I hear of you smoking a pipe again -- '' `` Captain Bridgeman smokes , '' replied I. `` Yes , sir , he smokes cigars ; but a child like you must not smoke a pipe . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 41]: `` And now come here , sir , '' said my granny , who had the lid of her snuff-box off , and held it open in her hand ; `` what have you been doing with my snuff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 15]: `` Why , granny , have I had your snuff-box the whole day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 6]: `` How should I know ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 27]: -- a boy like you , with every finger a fish-hook ; I do believe you have ; I only wish I could find you out .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 8]: I had fresh snuff this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 24]: `` Perhaps they made a mistake at the shop , mother , '' said aunt Milly ; `` they are very careless . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 21]: `` Well , I ca n't tell : I must have some more ; I ca n't take this . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 28]: `` Throw it in the fire , granny , '' said I ; `` and I 'll run with the box and get it full again . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 39]: `` Well , I suppose it 's the best thing I can do , '' replied the old woman , who went to the grate , and leaning over , poured the snuff out on the live coals .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 45]: The result was a loud explosion and a volume of smoke , which burst out of the grate into her face -- the dinner and lappets singed , her spectacles lifted from her nose , and her face as black as a sweep 's .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 45]: The old woman screamed , and threw herself back ; in so doing , she fell over the chair upon which she had been sitting , and , somehow or another , tripped me up , and lay with all her weight upon me .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 53]: I had been just attempting to make my escape during the confusion -- for my mother and Milly were equally frightened -- when I found myself completely smothered by the weight of my now almost senseless granny , and , as I have before mentioned , she was a very corpulent woman .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 58]: Had I been in any other position I should not have suffered so much ; but I had unfortunately fallen flat on my back , and was now lying with my face upwards , pressed upon by the broadest part of the old woman 's body ; my nose was flattened , and my breath completely stopped .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 75]: How long my granny might have remained there groaning I can not tell ; probably , as I was somewhat a spoiled child before this , it might have ended in her completely finishing me ; but she was roused up from her state of half syncope by a vigorous attack from my teeth , which , in the agony of suffocation , I used with preternatural force of jaw from one so young .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 26]: I bit right through everything she had on , and as my senses were fast departing , my teeth actually met with my convulsive efforts .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 47]: My granny , roused by the extreme pain , rolled over on her side , and then it was that my mother and aunt , who supposed that I had made my escape from the room , discovered me lifeless , and black in the face .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 55]: They ran to me , but I still held on with my teeth , nor could I be separated from my now screaming relative , until the admission of fresh air , and a plentiful sprinkling of cold water brought me to my senses , when I was laid on the sofa utterly exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 21]: It certainly was a narrow escape , and it may be said that the `` biter was nearly bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 100]: As for my granny , she recovered her fright and her legs , but she did not recover her temper ; she could not sit down without a pillow on the chair for many days , and , although little was said to me in consequence of the danger I had incurred , yet there was an evident abhorrence of me on the part of the old woman , a quiet manner about my mother , and a want of her usual hilarity on the part of my aunt , which were to me a foreboding of something unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 16]: A few days brought to light what was the result of various whisperings and consultations .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 60]: It was on a fine Monday morning , that Ben made his appearance at an unusually early hour ; my cap was put on my head , my cloak over my shoulders ; Ben took me by the hand , having a covered basket in the other , and I was led away like a lamb to the butcher .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 63]: As I went out there was a tear in the eyes of my aunt Milly , a melancholy over the countenance of my mother , and a twinkling expression of satisfaction in my grandmother 's eyes , which even her spectacles could not conceal from me : the fact was , my grandmother had triumphed , and I was going to school .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 29]: As soon as I was clear of the door , I looked up into Ben 's face and said , `` Father , where are we going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 18]: `` Well , '' replied he , `` I am going to take you to school . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 3]: `` School !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 9]: What am I going to school for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 37]: replied I. `` For biting your grandmother , I expect , in the first place , and to get a little learning , and a good deal of flogging , if what they say is true !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 8]: I never was at school myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 13]: `` What do you learn , and why are you flogged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 42]: `` You learn to read , and to write , and to count ; I ca n't do either -- more 's the pity ; and you are flogged , because without flogging , little boys ca n't learn anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 8]: This was not a very satisfactory explanation .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 28]: I made no further inquiries , and we continued our way in silence until we arrived at the school door ; there was a terrible buzz inside .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 32]: Ben tapped , the door opened , and a volume of hot air burst forth , all the fresh air having been consumed in repeating the fresh lessons for the day .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 104]: Ben walked up between the forms , and introduced me to the schoolmaster , whose name was Mr Thadeus O'Gallagher , a poor scholar from Ireland , who had set up an establishment at half-a-guinea a quarter for day scholars ; he was reckoned a very severe master , and the children were kept in better order in his school than in any other establishment of the kind in the town ; and I presume that my granny had made inquiries to that effect , as there were one or two schools of the same kind much nearer to my mother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 49]: Ben , who probably had a great respect for learning , in consequence of his having none himself , gave a military salute to Mr O'Gallagher , saying , with his hand still to his hat , `` A new boy , sir , come to school . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 7]: `` Oh , by the powers !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 7]: do n't I know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 26]: cried Mr O'Gallagher ; `` it 's the young gentleman who bit a hole in his grandmother ; Master Keene , as they call him .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 7]: Keen teeth , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 20]: Lave him with me ; and that 's his dinner in the basket I presume ; lave that too .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 17]: He 'll soon be a good boy , or it will end in a blow-up . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 142]: Ben put down the basket , turned on his heel , and left the schoolroom , and me standing by the throne of my future pedagogue -- I say throne , because he had not a desk , as schoolmasters generally have , but a sort of square dais , about eighteen inches high , on which was placed another oblong superstructure of the same height , serving him for a seat ; both parts were covered with some patched and torn old drugget , and upon subsequent examination I found them to consist of three old claret cases without covers , which he had probably picked up very cheap ; two of them turned upside down , so as to form the lower square , and the third placed in the same way upside down , upon the two lower .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 42]: Mr O'Gallagher sat in great dignity upon the upper one , with his feet on the lower , being thus sufficiently raised upon an eminence to command a view of the whole of his pupils in every part of the school .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 60]: He was not a tall man , but very square built , with carroty hair and very bushy red whiskers ; to me he appeared a most formidable person , especially when he opened his large mouth and displayed his teeth , when I was reminded of the sign of the Red Lion close to my mother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 54]: I certainly never had been before so much awed during my short existence as I was with the appearance of my pedagogue , who sat before me somewhat in the fashion of a Roman tribune , holding in his hand a short round ruler , as if it were his truncheon of authority .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 48]: I had not been a minute in the school before I observed him to raise his arm ; away went the ruler whizzing through the air , until it hit the skull of the lad for whom it was intended at the other end of the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 18]: The boy , who had been talking to his neighbour , rubbed his poll , and whined .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you bring back my ruler , you spalpeen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 4]: said Mr O'Gallagher .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 16]: `` Be quick , Johnny Target , or it will end in a blow-up . ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 39]: The boy , who was not a little confused with the blow , sufficiently recovered his senses to obey the order , and whimpering as he came up , returned the ruler to the hands of Mr O'Gallagher .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 37]: `` That tongue of yours will get you into more trouble than it will business , I expect , Johnny Target ; it 's an unruly member , and requires a constant ruler over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 9]: Johnny Target rubbed his head and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 40]: `` Master Keene , '' said he , after a short pause , `` did you see what a tundering tump on the head that boy got just now , and do you know what it was for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 15]: `` No , '' replied I. `` Where 's your manners , you animal ?
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 7]: No ` If you plase . '
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 26]: For the future , you must not forget to say , ` No , sir , ' or , ` No , Mr O'Gallagher . '
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 11]: D'ye mind me -- now say yes -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 6]: `` Yes , what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: `` Yes , what !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 32]: you little ignoramus ; say ` yes , Mr O'Gallagher , ' and recollect , as the parish clerk says , ` this is the last time of asking . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr O'Gallagher . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 46]: now you see , there 's nothing like coming to school -- you 've lear n't manners already ; and now , to go back again , as to why Johnny Target had the rap on the head , which brought tears into his eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 101]: I 'll just tell you , it was for talking ; you see , the first thing for a boy to learn , is to hold his tongue , and that shall be your lesson for the day ; you 'll just sit down there and if you say one word during the whole time you are in the school , it will end in a blow-up ; that means , on the present occasion , that I 'll skin you alive as they do the eels , which being rather keen work , will just suit your constitution . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 49]: I had wit enough to feel assured that Mr O'Gallagher was not to be trifled with , so I took my seat , and amused myself with listening to the various lessons which the boys came up to say , and the divers punishments inflicted -- few escaped .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 115]: At last , the hour of recreation and dinner arrived , the boys were dismissed , each seized his basket , containing his provisions , or ran home to get his meal with his parents : I found myself sitting in the school-room _ tete-a-tete _ with Mr O'Gallagher , and feeling very well inclined for my dinner I cast a wistful eye at my basket , but I said nothing ; Mr O'Gallagher , who appeared to have been in thought , at last said -- `` Mr Keene , you may now go out of school , and scream till you 're hoarse , just to make up for lost time . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 10]: `` May I take my dinner , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: inquired I. `` Is it your dinner you mane ?
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 60]: -- to be sure you may ; but , first , I 'll just look into the basket and its contents ; for you see , Mr Keene , there 's some victuals that do n't agree with larning ; and if you eat them , you 'll not be fit for your work when your play-hours are over .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 71]: What 's easy of digestion will do ; but what 's bad for little boys ' stomachs may get you into a scrape , and then it will end in a blow-up ; that is , you 'll have a taste of the ferrule or the rod -- two assistants of mine , to whom I 've not yet had the pleasure of introducing you -- all in good time .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 21]: If what I 've hear of you be true , you and they will be better acquainted afore long . ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 47]: Mr O'Gallagher then examined the contents of my basket ; my aunt Milly had taken care that I should be well provided : there was a large paper of beef sandwiches , a piece of bread and cheese , and three or four slices of seed-cake .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 47]: Mr O'Gallagher opened all the packages , and , after a pause , said -- `` Now , Master Keene , d'ye think you would ever guess how I came by all my larning , and what I fed upon when it was pumped into me ?
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 29]: Then I 'll tell you ; it was dry bread , with a little bit of cheese when I could get it , and that was n't often .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 71]: Bread and cheese is the food to make a scholar of ye ; and mayhap one slice of the cake may n't much interfere , so take them , and run away to the play-ground as fast as you can ; and , d'ye hear me , Master Keene , recollect your grace before meat -- ` For what we have received , the Lord make us truly thankful . '
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 6]: Now , off wid you .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 18]: The rest of the contents are confiscated for my sole use , and your particular benefit . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 32]: Mr O'Gallagher grinned as he finished his oration ; and he looked so much like a wild beast , that I was glad to be off as fast as I could .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 48]: I turned round as I went out of the door , and perceived that the sandwiches were disappearing with wonderful rapidity ; but I caught his eye : it was like that of a tiger 's at his meal , and I was off at redoubled speed .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 58]: As soon as I gained the play-ground , which was , in fact , nothing more than a small piece of waste land , to which we had no more claim than any other people , I sat down by a post , and commenced my dinner off what Mr O'Gallagher had thought proper to leave me .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 110]: I was afraid of him , it is true , for his severity to the other boys convinced me that he would have little mercy upon me , if I dared to thwart him ; but indignation soon began to obtain the mastery over my fears and I began to consider if I could not be even with him for his barefaced robbery of my dinner ; and then I reflected whether it would not be better to allow him to take my food if I found out that by so doing he treated me well ; and I resolved , at all events , to delay a little .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 35]: The hour of play was now over , and a bell summoned us all to school ; I went in with the others and took my seat where Mr O'Gallagher had before desired me .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 14]: As soon as all was silent , my pedagogue beckoned me to him .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 37]: `` Now , Mr Keene , '' said he , `` you 'll be so good as to lend me your ears -- that is , to listen while I talk to you a little bit .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 10]: D'ye know how many roads there are to larning ?
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 4]: Hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 20]: I ask you because I know you do n't know , and because I 'm going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 71]: There are exactly three roads : the first is the eye , my jewel ; and if a lad has a sharp eye like yours , it 's a great deal that will get into his head by that road ; you 'll know a thing when you see it again , although you may n't know your own father -- that 's a secret only known to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 47]: The second road to larning , young spalpeen , is the ear ; and if you mind all people say , and hear all you can , you 'll gain a great many truths and just ten times as much more in the shape of lies .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 27]: You see the wheat and the chaff will come together , and you must pick the latter out of the former at any seasonable future opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 135]: Now we come to the third road to larning , which is quite a different sort of road ; because , you see , the two first give us little trouble , and we trot along almost whether we will or not : the third and grand road is the head itself , which requires the eye and the ear to help it ; and two other assistants , which we call memory and application ; so you see we have the visual , then the aural , and then the mental roads -- three hard words which you do n't understand , and which I sha n't take the trouble to explain to such an animal as you are ; for I never throw away pearls to swine , as the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 17]: Now , then , Mr Keene , we must come to another part of our history .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 104]: As there are three roads to larning , so there are three manes or implements by which boys are stimulated to larn : the first is the ruler , which you saw me shy at the thick skull of Johnny Target , and you see 'd what a rap it gave him ; well , then , the second is the ferrule -- a thing you never heard of , perhaps ; but I 'll show it you ; here it is , '' continued Mr O'Gallagher , producing a sort of flat wooden ladle with a hole in the centre of it .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 20]: `` The ruler is for the head , as you have seen ; the ferrule is for the hand .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 21]: You have seen me use the ruler ; now I 'll show you what I do with the ferrule . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 11]: `` You Tommy Goskin , come here , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 23]: Tommy Goskin put down his book , and came up to his master with a good deal of doubt in his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 14]: `` Tommy Goskin , you did n't say your lesson well to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 20]: `` Yes I did , Mr O'Gallagher , '' replied Tommy , `` you said I did yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 19]: `` Well then , sir , you did n't say it well yesterday , '' continued Mr O'Gallagher .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 14]: `` Yes I did , sir , '' replied the boy , whimpering .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 12]: `` And is it you who dares to contradict me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 25]: cried Mr O'Gallagher ; `` at all events , you wo n't say it well to-morrow , so hold out your right hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 21]: Poor Tommy held it out , and roared lustily at the first blow , wringing his fingers with the smart .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 21]: `` Now your left hand , sir ; fair play is a jewel ; always carry the dish even . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 19]: Tommy received a blow on his left hand , which was followed up with similar demonstrations of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 31]: `` There sir you may go now , '' said Mr O'Gallagher , `` and mind you do n't do it again ; or else there 'll be a blow-up .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 33]: And now Master Keene , we come to the third and last , which is the birch for the tail -- here it is -- have you ever had a taste ? ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 41]: `` No , sir , '' replied I. `` Well , then , you have that pleasure to come , and come it will , I do n't doubt , if you and I are a few days longer acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 57]: Let me see -- '' Here Mr O'Gallagher looked round the school , as if to find a culprit ; but the boys , aware of what was going on , kept their eyes so attentively to their books , that he could not discover one ; at last he singled out a fat chubby lad .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 10]: `` Walter Puddock , come here , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 13]: Walter Puddock came accordingly ; evidently he gave himself up for lost .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 23]: `` Walter Puddock , I just have been telling Master Keene that you 're the best Latin scholar in the whole school .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 41]: Now , sir , do n't make me out to be a liar -- do me credit , -- or , by the blood of the O'Gallaghers , I 'll flog ye till you 're as thin as a herring .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 21]: What 's the Latin for a cocked hat , as the Roman gentlemen wore with their _ togeys _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 22]: Walter Puddock hesitated a few seconds , and then , without venturing a word of remonstrance , let down his trousers .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 13]: `` See now the guilty tief , he knows what 's coming .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 24]: Shame upon you , Walter Puddock , to disgrace your preceptor so , and make him tell a lie to young Master Keene .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 5]: Where 's Phil Mooney ?
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 42]: Come along , sir , and hoist Walter Puddock : it 's no larning that I can drive into you , Phil , but it 's sartain sure that by your manes I drive a little into the other boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 27]: Walter Puddock , as soon as he was on the back of Phil Mooney , received a dozen cuts with the rod , well laid on .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 14]: He bore it without flinching , although the tears rolled down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 45]: `` There , Walter Puddock , I told you it would end in a blow-up ; go to your dictionary , you dirty blackguard , and do more credit to your education and superior instruction from a certain person who shall be nameless . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 112]: Mr O'Gallagher laid the rod on one side , and then continued -- `` Now , Master Keene , I 've just shown you the three roads to larning , and also the three implements to persuade little boys to larn ; if you do n't travel very fast by the three first , why you will be followed up very smartly by the three last -- a nod 's as good as a wink to a blind horse , any day ; and one thing more , you little spalpeen , mind that there 's more mustard to the sandwiches to-morrow , or else it will end in a blow-up .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 29]: Now you 've got the whole theory of the art of tuition , Master Keene ; please the pigs , we 'll commence with the practice to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 36]: My worthy pedagogue did not address me any more during that day ; the school broke up at five , and I made haste home , thinking over all that had passed in the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 35]: My granny and mother were both anxious to know what had passed ; the first hoped that I had been flogged , the second that I had not , but I refused to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 26]: I assumed a haughty , indifferent air , for I was angry with my mother , and as for my grandmother , I hated her .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 17]: Aunt Milly , however , when we were alone , did not question me in vain .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 29]: I told her all that had passed ; she bade me be of good heart , and that I should not be ill-treated if she could help it .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 18]: I replied , that if I were ill-treated , I would have my revenge somehow or another .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 22]: I then went down to the barracks , to the rooms of Captain Bridgeman , and told him what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 16]: He advised me to laugh at the ruler , the ferrule , and the rod .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 68]: He pointed out to me the necessity of my going to school and learning to read and write , at the same time was very indignant at the conduct of Mr O'Gallagher , and told me to resist in every way any injustice or tyranny , and that I should be sure of his support and assistance , provided that I did pay attention to my studies .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 85]: Fortified by the advice and protection of my two great friends , I made up my mind that I would learn as fast as I could , but if treated ill , that I would die a martyr , rather than yield to oppression ; at all events , I would , if possible , play Mr O'Gallagher a trick for every flogging or punishment I received ; and with this laudable resolution I was soon fast asleep , too fast even to dream .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 41]: When my aunt Milly called me in the morning , that I might be up and have my breakfast in time for school , I felt as if two years had passed over my head during the last twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 27]: I had never witnessed tyranny until the day before , and my blood was heated with indignation : I felt myself capable of anything and everything .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 27]: My anger was about as great towards my mother and grandmother for having sent me to such a place , as it was against Mr O'Gallagher .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 50]: Instead of going up and kissing my mother , I paid no attention to either her or my grandmother , much to the mortification of the former and surprise of the latter , who said , in a very cross manner , `` Where 's your manners , child ?
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 9]: why do n't you say good morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 17]: `` Because I have not been long enough at school to learn manners , granny . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 17]: `` Come and kiss me before you go , my child , '' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 24]: `` No , mother ; you have sent me to school to be beat , and I never will kiss you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 7]: `` Naughty , good-for-nothing boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 14]: exclaimed my granny ; `` what a bad heart you must have . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 14]: `` No , that he has not , '' cried my aunt Milly .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 18]: `` Sister should have inquired what sort of a school it was before she sent him . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 20]: `` I made every inquiry , '' replied my granny ; `` he ca n't play tricks there . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: `` Wo n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 15]: cried I , `` but I will ; and not only there but here .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 26]: I 'll be even with you all ; yes , I 'll be even with you , granny , if I die for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 53]: `` Why , you audacious wretch , I 've great a mind to -- '' `` I dare say you have , but recollect I can bite ; you 'd better be quiet , granny , or , as the master says , ` it will end in a blow-up . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 30]: `` Only hear the little wretch , '' said my granny , lifting up her hands ; `` I shall see you hanged yet , you ungrateful child . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 34]: `` I 'm not ungrateful , '' replied I , throwing my arms round Milly 's neck , and kissing her with fervour ; `` I can love those who love me . ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: `` Then you do n't love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 6]: said my mother , reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 27]: `` I did yesterday , but I do n't now ; but it 's time for me to go , aunt ; is my basket ready ?
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 38]: I do n't want father to take me to school , I can do without him , and when I do n't choose to go any more , I wo n't ; recollect that , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 12]: So saying , I seized my basket and quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 78]: There was a long consultation , I found , after my departure : my mother , when my aunt had informed her of Mr O'Gallagher 's conduct , wished to remove me instantly ; my grandmother insisted upon it that there was not a word of truth in what I had said , and threatened that if I did not remain at that very school , she would leave Chatham , and take my aunt with her .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 21]: As my mother could not part with aunt Milly , the consequence was , that my grandmother gained the day .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 14]: I arrived in good time , and took my seat near my master .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 130]: I preferred doing this , as I had had a long conversation with Captain Bridgeman who told me that although Mr O'Gallagher had put the ruler down as punishment Number 1 , the ferrule Number 2 , and the birch as Number 3 , and of course they were considered to be worse as the number rose , that he considered it to be the very contrary , as he had had them all well applied when he was at school ; he ordered me , therefore , never to hold out my hand to the ferrule , by which refusal I should , of course , be flogged ; but he assured me that the birch , especially when it is given often , was a mere nothing .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 71]: Now I considered that the surest way to avoid the ruler was to sit close to my master , who could then have no pretence for sending it at my head ; the fact was I had determined to save the more noble portions of my body , and leave Mr O'Gallagher to do what he pleased with the other : to do him justice , he lost no time .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 17]: `` Come here , Mr Keene , '' said he , `` where 's your manners ?
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: why do n't you say good morning to your preceptor ?
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 7]: Can you read at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: `` D'ye know your letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 13]: `` Some of them -- I think I do , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 13]: `` Some of them -- I suppose about two out of six-and-twenty .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 26]: It 's particular attention that 's been paid to your education , I perceive ; you 've nothing to unlearn anyhow , that 's something .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 31]: Now , sir , do you think that a classical scholar and a gentleman born , like me , is to demane myself by hearing you puzzle at the alphabet ?
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 22]: You 're quite mistaken , Mr Keene , you must gain your first elements second-hand ; so where 's Thimothy Ruddel ?
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 81]: You , Timothy Ruddel , you 'll just teach this young Master Keene his whole alphabet , and take care , at the same time , that you know your own lessons , or it will end in a blow-up ; and you , Master Keene , if you have not larnt your whole alphabet perfect by dinner time , why you 'll have a small taste of Number 2 , just as a hint to what 's coming next .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 42]: Go along , you little ignorant blackguard ; and you , Timothy Ruddel , look out for a taste of Number 3 , if you do n't larn him and yourself all at once , and at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 34]: I was very well pleased with this arrangement ; I had resolved to learn , and I was doubly stimulated to learn now , to save poor Timothy Ruddel from an unjust punishment .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 60]: In the three hours I was quite perfect , and Timothy Ruddel , who was called up before me , was also able to say his lesson without a blunder very much to the disappointment of Mr O'Gallagher , who observed , `` So you 've slipped through my fingers , have you , this time , Master Timothy ?
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 25]: Never mind , I 'll have you yet ; and , moreover , there 's Master Keene to go through the fiery furnace . ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 33]: Just before dinner time I was called up ; with my memory of many of the letters , and the assistance I had received from Timothy Ruddel , I felt very confident .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 9]: `` What letter 's that , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 4]: said Mr O'Gallagher .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 25]: `` A B C D E. '' `` You little blackguard , I 'll dodge you ; you think to escape , you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 23]: `` V , X , P , O. '' Much to Mr O'Gallagher 's surprise I said them all without one mistake .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 7]: Instead of commendation I received abuse .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 50]: `` By all the powers , '' exclaimed my pedagogue , `` but everything seems to go wrong to-day ; my hand has been completely idle ; this will never do ; did n't you tell me , Mr Keene , that you did n't know your letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 12]: `` I said I knew some of them , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 22]: `` If my memory is correct , Mr Keene , you told me that you knew two out of twenty-six . ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 10]: `` No , sir , you said that . ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 44]: `` That 's just as much as to tell me , your preceptor , a classical scholar , and a Milesian gentleman to boot , that I lie , for which I intend to have satisfaction , Mr Keene , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 80]: You 're guilty in two counts , as they say at the Old Bailey , where you 'll be called up to some of these days , as sure as you stand there ; one count is in telling me a lie , in saying you did not know your alphabet , when it 's quite clear that you did ; and , secondly , in giving me the lie , by stating that I said what you said .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 31]: You thought to escape me , but you 're mistaken , Mr Keene ; so now , if you please , we will just have a taste of Number 2 .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 13]: Hould out your hand , Mr Keene : d'ye hear me sir ?
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 6]: hould out your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 8]: But this I positively refused to do .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 9]: `` You wo n't , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 31]: Well , then , we must increase the punishment for our contempt of court , and at once commence with Number 3 , which we intended to reserve till to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 32]: Come along , Phil Mooney , there 's fresh mate for you to carry , and come out Number 3 , here 's fresh ground for you to travel over . ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 22]: Phil Mooney and the birch soon made their appearance : I was hoisted by the one and scourged by the other .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 23]: The first taste of the birch is anything but agreeable ; I could only compare it to the dropping of molten lead .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 38]: I tried all I could to prevent crying out , but it was impossible , and at last I roared like a mad bull ; and I was as mad as a bull , and as dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 30]: Could I have picked up any weapon at the moment that I was dropped from the shoulders of Phil Mooney , it would have gone hard with Mr O'Gallagher .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: My rage was greater than my agony .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 24]: I stood when I had been landed , my chest heaving , my teeth set fast , and my apparel still in disorder .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 29]: The school was dismissed , and I was left alone with the savage pedagogue , who immediately took up my basket , and began to rummage the contents .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 22]: `` Make yourself decent , Mr Keene , and do n't be shocking my modesty , and taking away my appetite .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 11]: Did you mention the mustard , as I desired you ?
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 41]: Upon my faith , but you 're a nice boy and do justice to the representations of your grandmother , and when you see her you may tell her that I did not forget the promise she exacted from me .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 11]: You forgot all about the mustard , you little blackguard .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 33]: If Phil Mooney was here I would give you another taste to freshen your memory for to-morrow ; however , to-morrow will do as well , if the mistake 's not corrected .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 19]: Here , take your victuals , and good appetite to you , you little monster of iniquity . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 17]: Mr O'Gallagher tossed me some bread but this time reserved the cheese for his own eating .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 13]: I had adjusted my dress , and I therefore left the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 81]: I could not sit down without pain , so I leant against a post : the bread remained in my hand untouched ; had it been the greatest delicacy in the world I could not have tasted a morsel ; I was giddy from excess of feeling , my thoughts were rapidly chasing each other when I heard a voice close to me ; I looked round , it was Walter Puddock , who had been flogged the day before .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 65]: `` Never mind , Keene , '' said he , kindly ; `` it hurts at first , but the more you get it the less you care for it ; I do n't mind it a bit now ; I cries , because he goes on flogging till you do , and it 's no use having more than you can help . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 34]: `` I did n't deserve it , '' replied I. `` That 's not necessary ; you 'll get it , as we all do , whether you deserve it or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 29]: `` Well , I 'll try to deserve it in future , '' replied I , clenching my fist ; `` I 'll be even with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 9]: `` Why , what can you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 32]: `` Wait a little , and you 'll see , '' said I , walking away , for an idea had come into my head which I wished to follow up .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: Soon afterwards the bell rang , and we returned to the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 18]: I was put under the tuition of another boy , and took care to learn my lesson .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 43]: Whether it was that he was tired with the exercise , for he flogged and ferruled a dozen during that afternoon , or that he thought that my morning dose had been sufficient , I received no more punishment on that day .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 26]: As soon as school was dismissed , I went straight to the rooms of Captain Bridgeman , and told him how I had been treated .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 33]: As soon as he heard it , he exclaimed , `` This is really too bad ; I will go with you , and I will consult with your aunt Amelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 68]: It so happened that aunt Milly was alone in the shop when we arrived , and after a detail of what had passed , she told Captain Bridgeman that my grandmother had put me to that school out of feelings of ill-will for the tricks I had played , and had threatened that if I were removed she would leave Chatham and take her away with her .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 63]: My mother required assistance in the shop , and was afraid to affront my grandmother , who was a very dictatorial , positive old woman , and would certainly keep her resolution ; but that rather than I should be treated in such a barbarous manner she would insist upon my mother taking me away , or would herself leave the place .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 46]: `` It would never do for you to leave us , Miss Amelia , '' replied Captain Bridgeman , `` there are but few attractions in this place , and we can not spare you ; the whole corps would go into deep mourning . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 30]: `` I do n't want to leave the school , '' interrupted I ; `` I would not leave it till I am revenged , for all the world .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 25]: Now , I 'll tell you what I want to do -- and do it I will , if he cuts me to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 21]: He eats my sandwiches , and tells me if there 's not more mustard to-morrow , he 'll flog me .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 14]: He shall have plenty of mustard , but he shall have something else .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 16]: What can I put into the sandwiches , so as to half kill him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 38]: `` Not a bad idea , my little Percival , '' said Captain Bridgeman ; `` I 'll just ask the doctor how much calomel a man may take without a coroner 's inquest being required . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 29]: `` Yes , that will do nicely , '' said my aunt ; `` I 'll take care he shall have mustard enough not to perceive it . ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 19]: `` Well , I 'll go to the barracks and be back directly , '' said Captain Bridgeman .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 35]: `` And I 'm ready for the flogging as soon as the sandwiches are down his throat , '' replied I , laughing , `` I do n't care a fig for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 19]: Captain Bridgeman soon returned with forty grains of calomel , which he delivered into aunt Milly 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 49]: `` That is as much as we dare give the strongest man without running great danger ; we 'll try the effect of that upon him , and if he do n't improve , I think I shall go up to the school myself and threaten him . ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 48]: `` As for that , '' replied aunt Milly , `` I 'm sure that sister , if she hears what 's going on , as she can not take Percival away , will order her husband , Ben , to go up and thrash him . ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 32]: `` Not a bad idea , Miss Amelia , we 'll try that if we find it necessary ; at all events , we 'll see who can persecute most . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 37]: `` Granny has told him to treat me ill , '' said I , `` that 's very clear , from what he said ; never mind , I 'll make her sorry for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: `` Oh Percival !
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 28]: you must not do anything to granny , '' said aunt Milly , looking very archly ; `` I must not hear anything of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 35]: The next morning I set off with a full conviction that I should be flogged before night , and notwithstanding that , as full of joy as if I was going to the fair .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 47]: The morning passed as usual ; I said my lesson , but not very well ; I was thinking so much of my anticipated revenge , that I could not pay attention to my teacher , who was , as usual , one of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 60]: `` Master Keene , '' said Mr O'Gallagher , `` we 'll let the account stand over till the evening , and then I 'll give you a receipt in full ; I may have one or two lines to add to it before the sun goes down ; you 'll not escape me this time , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 28]: The boys went out at the dinner hour , leaving me , as before , to wait for my basket , after the tyrant had helped himself .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 13]: I stood by him in silence while he was rummaging its contents .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 22]: `` Now , Mr Keene , I 'll see if you 've remembered my particular injunction relative to the mustard . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 27]: `` I told my aunt to put more mustard , sir , '' replied I , humbly , `` it she that cuts the sandwiches . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 31]: `` Well , then , if your aunt has not complied with your request , see if I do n't flay you alive , you little imp of abomination . ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 11]: The sandwiches were pulled out of the paper and tasted .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 63]: `` Down on your knees , Mr Keene , and thank all the blessed saints that your aunt has saved you from at least one-half of what I intended to administer to you this blessed afternoon , for she has doubled the mustard , you tief , '' said Mr O'Gallagher , speaking with his mouth as full as it could hold .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 12]: Down went sandwich after sandwich , until they had all disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 5]: what joy was mine !
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 13]: I could have tossed up my cap and leapt in the air .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 42]: Having received the bread and cheese , for he permitted me to have the latter on this occasion I went out and enjoyed my meal , delighted with Mr O'Gallagher 's having fallen into the trap I had laid for him .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 30]: The bell summoned us in , and all went on as usual for the first two hours , when I thought Mr O'Gallagher changed countenance and looked very pale .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 55]: He continued , however , to hear the lessons , until at last I perceived him pass his hand up and down and across his stomach , as if he had had a twinge ; a few minutes afterwards , he compressed his thick lips , and then put his hands to his abdomen .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 65]: he begins to feel it now , '' thought I ; and sure enough he did ; for the pain increased so rapidly that he lost all patience , and vented his feelings by beating with his ruler , on the heads of the whole class of boys standing up before him , till one or two dropped down , stunned with the blows .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 79]: At last he dropped the ruler , and , pressing both hands to his stomach , he rolled himself backwards and forwards , and then twisted and distorted his legs till he could bear the pain no longer ; and he gave vent to a tremendous Irish howl -- grinning and grinding his teeth for a few seconds , and then howling again , writhing and twisting in evident agony -- while the perspiration ran off his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 3]: `` Och !
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 2]: murder !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: I 'm poisoned sure .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: Lord save my sinful soul !
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 6]: Oh -- oh -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: eh -- eh -- eh !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 10]: mercy , mercy , mercy , mercy , mercy !
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 5]: Oh holy St. Patrick !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 35]: I 'm kilt entirely : '' -- and so subdued was he at last by the pain , that he burst out into a flood of tears , crying and roaring like a child .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 14]: Again the paroxysms came on -- `` Murder , murder , murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 34]: shrieked the wretch at the highest pitch of his voice , so that he was heard at some distance , and some of the neighbours came in to inquire what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 34]: Mr O'Gallagher was now in a fainting state , and leaning against the table , he could merely say in a low voice , `` A doctor -- quick -- a doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 46]: The neighbours perceiving how ill he was , led him out of the school-rooms into his own apartment , one going for a doctor , and the others telling the boys they might all go home , a notice of which they gladly availed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 27]: I need hardly say , that I made all the haste I could to communicate the successful result of my trick to Milly and Captain Bridgeman .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 39]: The medical man who was summoned , gave Mr O'Gallagher some very active medicine , which assisted to rid him of the calomel ; of his having taken which , of course , the medical man was ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 56]: The violence of the dose was , however , so great , and left him in such a state , that Mr O'Gallagher could not leave his room for three days , nor resume his seat in the school until a week had elapsed , during which I remained at home plotting still further mischief .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 15]: Mr O'Gallagher resumed his occupations , and I was again sent off to school .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 54]: When I entered the school-room I found him looking very pale and cadaverous ; as soon as he saw me his lips were drawn apart , and he showed his large white teeth , reminding me of the grinning of a hyena ; he did not , however , say anything to me .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 18]: My studies were resumed ; I said my lesson perfectly , but was fully prepared for punishment .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 21]: I was , however , agreeably disappointed ; he did not punish either me or any of the other boys .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 39]: I afterwards found out the reason was , that , although necessity compelled him to re-open his school as soon as he could , he was too weak to undergo the fatigue of following up his favourite diversion .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 29]: When the dinner-hour arrived , and the boys were dismissed , I waited patiently to see what he would do with my basket , which stood beside him .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 27]: `` Take your basket , and eat your dinner , Master Keene , '' said he , walking out of the school-room into his own apartments .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 17]: I could not help saying , `` Wo n't you have the sandwiches , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 33]: He turned round and gave me a look so penetrating and so diabolical , that I felt sure that he knew to whom he had been indebted for his late severe illness .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 25]: From this day forward Mr O ' G never interfered with the contents of my basket and I had my dinner all to myself .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 70]: The shock which had been given to his constitution was so great , that for three or four months he may be said to have crawled to his school room , and I really began to think that the affair would turn out more serious than was intended ; but gradually he regained his strength , and as he recovered his vigour , so did he resume his severity .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 22]: But I was a great gainer during the three or four months of quiet which reigned during Mr O'Gallagher 's convalescence .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 35]: Since I have been grown up , I have often thought , and am indeed confirmed in my opinion , that we lose rather than gain by being educated at too early an age .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 80]: Commence with one child at three years , and with another at seven years old , and in ten years , the one whose brain was left fallow even till seven years old , will be quite as far , if not further advanced , than the child whose intellect was prematurely forced at the earlier age ; this is a fact which I have since seen proved in many instances , and it certainly was corroborated in mine .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 61]: In six months I could read and write very fairly , and had commenced arithmetic ; true , I was stimulated on by the advice of Captain Bridgeman , the love I bore my aunt Milly , and the hatred which I had for my master , which made me resolve that I would not deserve punishment on that score .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 37]: It was in May that I administered the dose to Mr O'Gallagher ; in September he was quite well again , and the ruler , the ferrule , and the rod , were triumphantly at work .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 53]: It is useless to say how often I was punished , for it was every day ; always once , sometimes twice ; I became completely callous to it , nay , laughed at it , but my mind was ever at work upon some mischief , in the way of retaliation .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 34]: I put little pancakes of cobblers ' wax on Mr O'Gallagher 's throne , and he had the pleasure of finding himself stuck fast by the breeches when he rose up to punish .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 41]: I anointed the handle of the ferrule and rod with bird-lime ; put dead cats under the claret cases , which composed his seat of authority , so that the smell would drive him distracted before he found it out .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 47]: I drew up with a squirt , all the ink which was in the inkstands fixed in the writing-desks , so as not to be taken out of the sockets , and made good the deficiency with water , which put him to no little expense .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 79]: I once made him almost frantic , by rubbing his handkerchief which always laid by his side , and with which he was accustomed to wipe his face every five minutes -LRB- for he was profuse in his perspiration -RRB- , with what is called cow-itch : not being aware of what was the cause , he wiped his face more and more , until he was as red as a peony , and the itching became intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 18]: On such occasions he never inquired who was the party , but called me and Phil Mooney .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 16]: I , on the other hand , never said a word in way of expostulation .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 27]: I took my flogging , which was as severe as he could give it , as a matter of course , quite satisfied with the exchange .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 49]: As Walter Puddock had told me , and , as I have no doubt , the Eton boys will confirm , after a certain quantity of flagellations , the skin becomes so hard as to make the punishment almost a matter of indifference and so I found it .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 30]: So passed the time until the month of November , when I was fully enabled to pay off my worthy pedagogue for all that I was indebted to him .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 88]: The boys had been saving up all their money to purchase fireworks for the celebrated 5th of November -- a day on which it was said that certain persons , finding it impossible to reform the Lords and Commons , had determined to get rid of them at once : why they have not been in similar danger every year since the first attempt was made , I know not ; certain it is , that it is the only reform measure that can ever be effectual .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 41]: Guy Fawkes and his confederates , whether Popish or Protestant , from the disregard of human life , certainly proved themselves the founders of a party , still existing , whose motto is , `` Measures and not Men . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 86]: But to proceed : Mr O'Gallagher had never before attempted to interfere with the vested rights of urchins on that day ; being , however , in a most particular irascible humour , instead of a whole , he made it known that there would only be a half , holiday , and we were consequently all called in for morning lessons instead of carrying about , as we had intended , the effigy of the only true reformer that ever existed in this country .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 36]: This made us all very sulky and discontented in the first place , and our anxiety to get out of school was so great , that the lessons were not very perfect in the second .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 78]: The ferrule and rod were called out and liberally administered ; but what was our horror and dismay when Mr O'Gallagher , about an hour before dinner , announced to us that all the squibs and crackers , with which our pockets were crammed , were to be given up immediately ; and that , as we had not said our lessons well , there would be no half-holiday , the whole school were in mute despair .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 81]: One by one were the boys summoned up to the throne of Mr O'Gallagher , and their pockets searched by Phil Mooney , who emptied them of their pyrotechnical contents , all of which were deposited on the dais of Mr O'Gallagher 's throne , which , I have before observed , was composed of two empty claret cases turned upside down , surmounted by another , on which Mr O'Gallagher sat , all three covered with old green baize .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 66]: By the time that the whole school had been rifled , the heap of fireworks was very considerable , and Mr O'Gallagher , to prevent any of them being recovered by the boys , lifted up the claret case on which he sat , and which was on the top of the other two , and desired Phil Mooney to put them all underneath it .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 24]: This was done ; Mr O'Gallagher resumed his seat , and the lessons continued till the dinner hour arrived , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 7]: not the half-holiday or the fireworks .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 29]: The boys went out ; some mournful , some angry , some sulky , some frightened ; a few , a very few , declaiming against such injustice .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 32]: I was in a rage ; my blood boiled ; at last my invention came to my aid , and , without considering the consequences , I determined how to act .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 60]: As it was an hour and a half before school would commence , I hastened home , and , having spent all my money , begged aunt Milly to give me some ; she gave me a shilling , and with that I bought as much gunpowder as I could procure , more than a quarter of a pound .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 74]: I then returned to the school , looked into the school-room , and found it empty ; I quickly raised up the claret case , under which the fireworks had been placed , put the powder under it , leaving only sufficient for a very small train , which would not be perceived in the green baize covering ; having so done , I left the school-room immediately , and rejoined my companions .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 38]: I had a piece of touch-wood , as all the boys had , to let off their fireworks with , and this I lighted and left in a corner until the bell should summons us into school .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 22]: how my heart beat when I heard the sound , so full was I of anxiety lest my project should fail .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 7]: Once more we were all assembled .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 55]: Mr O'Gallagher surveying , with the smile of a demon , the unhappy and disappointed faces of the boys , was again perched upon his throne , the rod on one side , the ferrule on the other , and the ruler , that dreaded truncheon of command , clenched in his broad fist .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 38]: I had the touchwood lighted and concealed in my hand ; gradually I moved downwards , until at last , unperceived by Mr O'Gallagher , I was behind him , and close to my train of gunpowder .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 51]: I gave one look to ascertain if he had observed me ; his eye was roving over the school for some delinquent to throw his ruler at ; fearful that he might turn round to me , I no longer hesitated , and the touchwood was applied to the train .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 97]: Ignorant as I was of the force of gunpowder , it was with astonishment , mingled with horror , that I beheld , in a second , the claret case rise up as if it had wings , and Mr O'Gallagher thrown up to the ceiling enveloped in a cloud of smoke , the crackers and squibs fizzing and banging , while the boys in the school uttered a yell of consternation and fear as they rushed from from the explosion , and afterwards , tumbling over one another , made their escape from the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 23]: The windows had all been blown out with a terrible crash , and the whole school-room was now covered by the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 14]: There I stood in silent dismay at the mischief which I had done .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 32]: The squibs and crackers had not , however , all finished popping , before I heard the howling of Mr O'Gallagher , who had fallen down upon the centre school-room table .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 66]: I was still in the school-room , half-suffocated , yet not moving away from where I stood , when the neighbours , who had been alarmed by the explosion and the cries of the boys , rushed in , and perceiving only me and Mr O'Gallagher , who still howled , they caught hold of us both , and bore us out in their arms .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 41]: It was high time , for the school-room was now on fire , and in a few minutes more the flames burst out of the windows , while volumes of smoke forced through the door and soon afterwards the roof .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 32]: The engines were sent for , but before they could arrive , or water be procured , the whole tenement was so enveloped in flames that it could not be saved .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 16]: In an hour , the _ locale _ of our misery was reduced to ashes .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 35]: They had put me on my legs as soon as we got clear of the school-room , to ascertain whether I was hurt , and finding that I was not , they left me .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 76]: I never shall forget what my sensations were , when I beheld the flames and volumes of smoke bursting out ; the hurry , and bustle , and confusion outside ; the working of the engines , the troops marched up from the barracks , the crowd of people assembled , and the ceaseless mingling of tongues from every quarter ; and all this is my doing , thought I -- mine -- all mine .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 23]: I felt delighted that I had no partner or confederate ; I could , at all events , keep my own secret .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 59]: I did , however , feel some anxiety as to Mr O'Gallagher , for , much as I detested him , I certainly had no intention to kill him ; so after a time , I made inquiries , and found that he was alive : and in no danger , although very much bruised and somewhat burnt .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 43]: No one could explain how the catastrophe occurred , further than that Mr O'Gallagher had collected all the squibs and crackers from the boys , and that they had exploded somehow or another -- most people said that it served him right .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 39]: My grandmother shook her head and said , `` Yes , yes , gunpowder will go off , but -- '' and she looked at me -- `` it requires a match to be put to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 11]: I looked up very innocently , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: Mr O'Gallagher 's favourite expression , to wit , `` that it would end in a blow-up , '' proved , as far as his school was concerned , literally true .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 32]: He had not the means of procuring another suitable tenement in Chatham , and as soon as he had recovered from the injuries he had received , he quitted the town .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 58]: It was not until he had left , that I ventured to make known to Captain Bridgeman , and my aunt Milly , the trifling share I had in the transaction ; and they , perceiving the prudence of keeping my secret , desired me on no account to let it be known to any one else .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 86]: As soon as it was ascertained that Mr O'Gallagher was gone , my grandmother insisted upon my being sent to another school , and on this occasion my mother made the inquiries herself , and I was despatched to one much nearer home , and being treated well , not only played fewer tricks , but advanced rapidly in my education ; so rapidly indeed , that my grandmother began to think that I was not so bad a boy as I used to be .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 32]: As she treated me more kindly , I felt less inclined to teaze her although the spirit of mischief was as undiminished as ever , and was shown in various ways .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 33]: I may as well here observe , that out of the many admirers of my aunt Milly , there were only two who appeared to be at all constant in their attention .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 52]: One was Lieutenant Flat , who was positively smitten , and would have laid his pay and person at her feet , had he received anything like encouragement ; but my aunt disliked him in the first place , and , moreover , had a very strong feeling towards Captain Bridgeman .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 47]: Mr Flat was certainly a very fine-looking soldier , being tall , erect , and well-made , but he was at the same time not over-brilliant ; he was , as an officer , the very sort of person my father Ben was as a private .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 31]: But the other party , Captain Bridgeman , did not come forward ; he appeared to be in doubt , and not at all able to make up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 48]: The fact was , that my mother being married to a private , made any match with the sister objectionable to the whole corps , as it would be derogatory that one sister should be the wife of a private , and the other of an officer .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 56]: Ben would have been able to say , `` My brother-in-law , the captain of my division , '' which would never have done ; and this Captain Bridgeman felt , and therefore resisted , as well as he could , the inroads which my aunt 's beauty and mirth had made into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 27]: My aunt was exactly a person to suit Captain Bridgeman as a helpmate , had it not been for this unfortunate alliance of my mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 86]: Lieutenant Flat was too stupid and indifferent to the opinion of the other officers , to care anything about what they thought ; he would have married Milly long before , but my aunt , who had made up her mind to marry an officer , did not yet despair of obtaining the captain ; and although she would not positively dismiss Lieutenant Flat , she merely kept him as a sort of reserve , to fall back upon when every other chance was gone .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 90]: I should like , if I possibly could , to give the reader some idea of my mother 's circulating-library and sort of universal commodity shop : it was a low-windowed building , one story high , but running a long way back , where it was joined to a small parlour , in which we generally sat during the day , as it was convenient in case of company or customers , the little parlour having a glass door , which permitted us to look into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 43]: In the front windows , on one side , were all the varieties of tapers , sealing-wax , inkstands , and every kind of stationery , backed by children 's books , leather writing-cases , prints , caricatures , and Tonbridge ware .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 33]: In the other windows were ribbons , caps , gloves , scarfs , needles , and other little articles in demand by ladies , and which they required independent of their milliners .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 20]: At the entrance were sticks and canes ; on the counter a case of gold and more moderate-priced trinkets .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 18]: On the shelves of the millinery side were boxes of gloves , ribbons , buttons , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 23]: On the opposite side , perfumes , cigars , toothbrushes , combs , scented soaps , and other requisites for the toilet .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 27]: About ten feet on each side of the shop was occupied with the above articles ; the remainder of the shelves were reserved for the circulating-library .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 50]: At the back of the shop were some seats round a small table , on which was laid the newspaper of the day , and on each side of the parlour-door were hoops , bats , balls , traps , skittles , and a variety of toys for children .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 39]: My mother usually attended to the millinery , and my aunt Milly to what might be termed the gentlemen 's side of the shop ; the remainder of the goods and circulating-library were in the hands of both .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 46]: There were few hours of the day in which the chairs at the counter and round the table were not taken possession of by some one or another , either reading the paper or a book , or talking , to pass away the time .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 36]: In fact , it was a sort of rendezvous , where all who met knew each other , and where the idle of our own sex used to repair to get rid of their time .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 31]: Captain Bridgeman and Mr Flat were certainly the two most constantly to be found there , although few of the marine officers were a day without paying us a visit .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 22]: Such was the _ locale _ ; to describe the company will be more difficult , but I will attempt it .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: My mother , remarkably nicely dressed , is busy opening a parcel of new books just arrived .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 27]: My aunt Milly behind the counter , on the gentlemen 's side , pretending to be working upon a piece of muslin about five inches square .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 21]: Mr Flat sitting near the table , fallen back in his chair , apparently watching the flies on the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 52]: Captain Bridgeman , a very good-looking man , very slight , but extremely active , is sitting at the counter opposite to where my aunt is standing , a small black cane , with a silver head to it , in his hand , and his gloves peculiarly clean and well-fitting .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 45]: He has an eye as sharp as an eagle 's , a slight hook to his nose , thin lips , and very white teeth ; his countenance is as full of energy and fire as that of lieutenant Flat is heavy and unmeaning .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 36]: `` Miss Amelia , if I may take the liberty , '' said Captain Bridgeman , pointing with his cane to the bit of muslin she is employed upon ; `` what are you making ?
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 14]: it 's too small for any part of a lady 's dress . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 14]: `` It is quite large enough for a cuff , Captain Bridgeman . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 15]: `` A cuff ; then you are making a cuff , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 25]: `` Indeed she is not , Captain Bridgeman , '' replies my mother ; `` it is only to keep herself out of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 9]: She spoils a bit like that every week .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 24]: And that 's why it is so small , Captain Bridgeman ; it would be a pity to spoil a larger piece . ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 23]: `` I really was not aware that such a mere trifle would keep you out of mischief , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 23]: `` You know , '' replied Aunt Milly , `` that idleness is the root of all evil , Captain Bridgeman . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 9]: `` Flat , do you hear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 4]: says Captain Bridgeman .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 3]: replies Flat .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 19]: `` That idleness is the root of all evil ; what an evil-disposed person you must be . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 9]: `` I was thinking , '' replied Flat .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 13]: `` I suspect it 's only lately you 've taken to that .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: Who or what were you thinking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 19]: `` Well , I believe I was thinking how long it would be before dinner was ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 25]: `` That 's very rude , Mr Flat ; you might have said that you were thinking about me , '' replied my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 19]: `` Well , so I was at first , and then I began to think of dinner-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 37]: `` Do n't be offended , Miss Amelia ; Flat pays you a great compliment in dividing his attentions ; but I really wish to know why ladies will spoil muslin in such a predetermined manner .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 9]: Will you explain that , Mrs Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 29]: `` Yes , Captain Bridgeman : a piece of work is very valuable to a woman , especially when she finds herself in company with gentlemen like you .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 74]: It saves her from looking down , or looking at you , when you are talking nonsense ; it prevents your reading in her eyes what is passing in her mind , or discovering what effect your words may have upon her ; it saves much awkwardness , and very often a blush ; sometimes a woman hardly knows which way to look ; sometimes she may look any way but the right .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 35]: Now a bit of muslin with a needle is a remedy for all that , for she can look down at her work , and not look up till she thinks it advisable . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 37]: `` I thank you for your explanation , madam ; I shall always take it as a great compliment if I see a lady very busy at work when I 'm conversing , with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 32]: `` But you may flatter yourself , Captain Bridgeman , '' replied my mother ; `` the attention to her work may arise from perfect indifference , or from positive annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 13]: It saves the trouble of making an effort to be polite . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 27]: `` And pray , may I inquire , Miss Amelia , what feeling may cause your particular attention to your work at this present moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 38]: `` Perhaps in either case to preserve my self-possession , '' replied Amelia ; `` or perhaps , Captain Bridgeman , I may prefer looking at a piece of muslin to looking at a marine officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 28]: `` That 's not very flattering , '' replied the captain ; `` if you spoil the muslin , you 're determined not to spoil me . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 29]: `` The muslin is of little value , '' said Amelia , softly , walking to the other side of the shop , and turning over the books .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 31]: `` Mr Flat , '' said my mother , `` your subscription to the library is out last month ; I presume I can put your name down again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 21]: `` Well , I do n't know ; I never read a book , '' replied Mr Flat , yawning .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 54]: `` That 's not at all necessary , Mr Flat , '' said my mother ; `` in most businesses there are sleeping partners ; besides , if you do n't read , you come here to talk , which is a greater enjoyment still , and luxuries must be paid for . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 25]: `` Well , I 'll try another quarter , '' replied Mr Flat , `` and then -- '' `` And then what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 7]: said my aunt Milly , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 12]: `` Well , I do n't know , '' says Flat .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 12]: `` Is that clock of yours right , Mrs Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 30]: `` It is ; but I am fearful that your thoughts run faster than the clock , Mr Flat ; you are thinking of the dress-bugle for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 8]: `` No , I was not . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: `` Then you were thinking of yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 23]: `` No , I was n't , Mrs Keene , '' said Flat , rising , and walking out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 41]: `` I 'll tell you , '' said he , turning round as he went out , `` what I was thinking of , Mrs Keene ; not of myself , -- I was thinking of my bull pup . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 11]: My mother burst out a laughing as the lieutenant disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 35]: `` I was not far wrong when I said he was thinking of himself , '' said she , `` for a _ calf _ is a sort of _ bull pup _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 22]: At this sally Captain Bridgeman laughed , and danced about the shop ; at last he said , `` Poor Flat !
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 12]: Miss Amelia , he 's desperately in love with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 16]: `` That 's more than I am with him , '' said Amelia , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 6]: Here two ladies came in .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 8]: Captain Bridgeman made a most polite bow .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 26]: `` I trust Mrs Handbell is quite well and Miss Handbell -- I hardly need ask the question with the charming colour you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 24]: `` Captain Bridgeman , you appear to live in this library ; I wonder Mrs Keene do n't take you into partnership . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 37]: `` If I were not honoured with the custom of Mrs Handbell and other ladies ; I fear that my shop would have little attraction for gentlemen , '' replied my mother , with a courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 36]: `` Mrs Keene is quite correct in her surmise , Miss Handbell , '' said Captain Bridgeman , `` now that I have seen you , I shall not think my morning thrown away . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 35]: `` If report says true , Captain Bridgeman , '' replied Mrs Handbell , `` you would be quite as often here , even if no ladies were to be customers of Mrs Keene .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 14]: Mrs Keene , have you any of that narrow French ribbon left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 19]: `` I think I have , madam ; it was off this piece , was it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 30]: `` Yes ; but I really do n't know exactly how much I require ; perhaps you will measure it and allow me to return what is left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 19]: `` Certainly , madam ; will you take it with you , or shall I send it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 25]: `` I wish for it directly ; will you be very long in measuring it , for I ought to be home now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 31]: `` Perhaps you 'll have the kindness to measure what you take off yourself , madam , '' replied my mother , `` and then you need not wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 28]: `` You put confidence in me , I observe , Mrs Keene , '' replied Mrs Handbell ; `` well , I will do you justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 32]: My mother smiled most graciously , put the piece of ribbon in paper , and handed it to Mrs Handbell , who , bowing to Captain Bridgeman , quitted the shop .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 13]: `` I wonder whether you would trust me in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: said Captain Bridgeman to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 29]: `` I do n't think I should ; Amelia says you will help yourself to cigars and that she is sure you cheat when you count them . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 7]: `` Does she really say that ?
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 26]: Well , I did think that if there was any one who would have upheld my character , it would have been Miss Amelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 15]: `` Perhaps , Captain Bridgeman , she is getting tired of so doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 15]: `` Or tired of me , Mrs Keene , which would be worse still .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 27]: Here comes a fair young lady -- Miss Evans , if I mistake not ; I believe she is a good customer to your library ? ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 18]: `` She reads a great deal , and is therefore only a customer to the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 14]: `` Ladies who are fond of reading are seldom fond of working . ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 25]: `` Good morning Miss Evans , '' said Captain Bridgeman ; `` you come for more food for the mind , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 14]: -LRB- Miss Evans gave a bob , and turned to my mother . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 9]: `` Have you anything new , Mrs Keene ?
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 11]: I have brought back the three volumes of Godolphin . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 13]: `` Yes , miss , I have some books down to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 29]: While Miss Evans was selecting from the new books , enter Mr Jones , Mr Smith , and Mr Claville , of the marine corps , for cigars .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 31]: Amelia comes out to attend them -- they purchase a few articles , and are talking very loud , when three more ladies enter the shop , all for books .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: It being now about three o'clock , the customers and loungers come in fast .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 34]: Captain Bridgeman saunters away in company with his brother officers ; other parties enter , who are succeeded by fresh claimants for books or the other articles to be procured in the repository .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 53]: This demand continues till about five o'clock , when the library becomes empty ; I come home from school , my father slinks in from barracks , and my mother and sister return to the back parlour , where they find my grandmother , as usual , very busy with her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 16]: Such is a fair sample of what took place at our shop every succeeding day .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 14]: My mother made few bad debts , and rapidly added to her savings .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 31]: My aunt Milly still balancing between the certainty of Lieutenant Flat and the chance of Captain Bridgeman , and I dividing my time and talents between learning and contriving mischief .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 42]: About six months after I had blown up the school of Mr O'Gallagher , the company to which my father Ben belonged was ordered afloat again , and shortly afterwards sailed for the East Indies , in the Redoubtable , 74 .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 76]: That my mother was very much pleased at his departure , I do not scruple to assert ; but whether she ever analysed her feelings , I can not pretend to say ; I rather think that all she wished was , that the chapter of accidents would prevent Ben 's reappearance , as she was ashamed of him as a husband , and felt that he was an obstacle to her sister 's advancement .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 27]: So one fine day Ben wished us all good bye ; my mother was very generous to him , as she could well afford to be .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 55]: I rather think that Ben himself was not sorry to go , for , stupid as he was , he must have felt what a cypher he had become , being treated , not only by my mother , but by everybody else , even by me , as a sort of upper servant .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 50]: It so happened , that about a month after Ben 's departure , Captain Delmar had , through the interest of his uncle , Lord de Versely , been appointed to a ship which was lying in the Medway , and he came down to Chatham to join her .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 40]: He had no idea that my mother was there , for he had lost sight of her altogether , and had it not been for me , might very probably have left the town without having made the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 104]: Among other amusements , I had a great partiality for a certain bull pup , mentioned by Lieutenant Flat in the former chapter , and which he had made me a present of ; the pup was now grown up , and I had taught it many tricks ; but the one which afforded me most amusement -LRB- of course , at other people 's expense -RRB- was , that I had made out of oakum a sham pigtail , about a foot and a half long , very strong and think , with an iron hook at the upper end of it .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 69]: The sham tail I could easily hook on to the collar of any one 's coat from behind , without their perceiving it ; and Bob had been instructed by me , whenever I told him to fetch it -LRB- and not before -RRB- , to jump up at the tail wherever it might be , and hang on to it with all the tenacity of the race .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 75]: As it may be supposed , this was a great source of mirth in the barracks ; it was considered a good joke , and was much applauded by Captain Bridgeman ; but it was not considered a good joke out of the barracks ; and many an old woman had I already frightened almost out of her senses , by affixing the tail to any portion of the back part of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 57]: It so happened , that one afternoon , as I was cruising about with Bob at my heels , I perceived the newly-arrived Captain Delmar , in all the pomp of pride of full uniform , parading down the street with a little middy at his heels ; and I thought to myself , `` Law !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 54]: how I should like to hang my tail to his fine coat , if I only dared ; '' the impulse had become so strong , that I actually had pulled up my pinafore and disengaged the tail ready for any opportunity , but I was afraid that the middy would see me .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 50]: Captain Delmar had passed close to me , the middy at his heels was passing , and I thought all chance was gone , when , suddenly , Captain Delmar turned short round and addressed the little officer , asking him whether he had brought the order-book with him ?
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 41]: The middy touched his hat , and said , `` No ; '' upon which Captain Delmar began to inflict a most serious lecture upon the lad for forgetting what he had forgotten himself , and I again passed by .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 53]: This was an opportunity I could not resist ; while the captain and middy were so well employed giving and receiving I fixed my oakum tail to the collar of the Captain 's gold-laced coat , and then walked over to the other side of the street with Bob at my heels .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 49]: The middy being duly admonished , Captain Delmar turned round again and resumed his way ; upon which I called Bob , who was quite as ready for the fun as I was , and pointing to the captain , said , `` Fetch it , Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 52]: My companion cleared the street in three or four bounds , and in a few seconds afterwards made a spring up the back of Captain Delmar , and seizing the tail , hung by it with his teeth , shaking it with all his might as he hung in the air .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 25]: Captain Delmar was , to use a sailor 's term , completely taken aback ; indeed he was nearly capsized by the unexpected assault .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 36]: For a short time he could not discover what it was ; at last , by turning his head over his shoulder and putting his hand behind him , he discovered who his assailant was .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 12]: Just at that time , I called out `` Mad dog !
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 4]: mad dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 44]: and Captain Delmar , hearing those alarming words , became dreadfully frightened ; his cocked hat dropped from his head , and he took to his heels as fast as he could , running down the street , with Bob clinging behind him .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 40]: The first open door he perceived was that of my mother 's library ; he burst in , nearly upsetting Captain Bridgeman , who was seated at the counter , talking to Aunt Milly , crying out `` Help !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 3]: help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 24]: As he turned round , his sword became entangled between his legs , tripped him up , and he fell on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 34]: This unhooked the tail , and Bob galloped out of the shop , bearing his prize to me , who , with the little middy , remained in the street convulsed with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 83]: Bob delivered up the tail , which I again concealed under my pinafore , and then with a demure face ventured to walk towards my mother 's house , and , going in at the back door , put Master Bob in the wash-house out of the way ; the little middy who had picked up the captain 's hat , giving me a wink as I passed him , as much as to say , I wo n't inform against you .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 41]: In the meantime Captain Delmar had been assisted to his legs by Captain Bridgeman , who well knew who had played the trick , and who , as well as Aunt Milly , had great difficulty in controlling his mirth .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 4]: `` Merciful heaven !
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 4]: what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 5]: Was the animal mad ?
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 6]: Has it bitten me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 20]: exclaimed Captain Delmar , falling back in his chair , in which he had been seated by Captain Bridgeman .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 31]: `` I really do not know , '' replied Captain Bridgeman ; `` but you are not hurt , sir , apparently , nor indeed is your coat torn . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 10]: `` What dog -- whose dog can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 21]: -- it must be shot immediately -- I shall give orders -- I shall report the case to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: May I ask for a glass of water ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 5]: Oh , Mr Dott !
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 24]: you 're there , sir ; how came you to allow that dog to fasten himself on my back in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 42]: `` If you please , '' said the middy , presenting his cocked hat to the captain , `` I did draw my dirk to kill him , but you ran away so fast that I could n't catch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 23]: `` Very well , sir , you may go down to the boat and wait for orders , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 37]: At this moment my mother , who had been dressing herself , made her first appearance , coming out of the back parlour with a glass of water , which aunt Milly had gone in for .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 67]: Perceiving a gold-laced captain , she advanced all smiles and courtesies , until she looked in his face , and then she gave a scream , and dropped the tumbler on the floor , much to the surprise of Captain Bridgeman , and also of aunt Milly , who , not having been at the Hall , was not acquainted with the person of Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 67]: Just at this moment in came I , looking as demure as if , as the saying is , `` butter would not melt in my mouth , '' and certainly as much astonished as the rest at my mother 's embarrassment ; but she soon recovered herself , and asked Captain Delmar if he would condescend to repose himself a little in the back parlour .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 40]: When my mother let the tumbler fall , the captain had looked her full in the face and recognised her , and , in a low voice , said , `` Excessively strange , -- so very unexpected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 16]: He then rose up from the chair and followed my mother into the back room .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 7]: `` Who can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: said Aunt Milly to Captain Bridgeman , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 14]: `` I suppose it must be the new captain appointed to the Calliope .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 15]: I read his name in the papers , -- the Honourable Captain Delmar . ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 35]: `` It must be him , '' replied Milly ; `` for my sister was brought up by his aunt , Mrs Delmar ; no wonder she was surprised at meeting him so suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 24]: Percival , you naughty boy , '' continued Milly , shaking her finger at me , `` it was all your doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 6]: `` Oh , Aunt Milly !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 16]: you should have seen him run , '' replied I , laughing at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 27]: `` I 'd recommend you not to play with post captains , '' said Captain Bridgeman , `` or you may get worse than you give .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 5]: Mercy on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 11]: exclaimed he , looking at me full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 4]: said aunt Milly .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 30]: Captain Bridgeman leant over the counter , and I heard him whisper , `` Did you ever see such a likeness as between the lad and Captain Delmar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 17]: Milly blushed a little , nodded her head , and smiled , as she turned away .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 24]: Captain Bridgeman appeared to be afterwards in a brown study ; he tapped his boot with his cane , and did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 33]: About a quarter of an hour passed , during which Captain Delmar remained with my mother in the parlour , when she opened the door , and beckoned me to come in .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 72]: I did so not without some degree of anxiety , for I was afraid that I had been discovered : but this doubt was soon removed ; Captain Delmar did me the honour to shake hands with me , and then patted my head saying , he hoped I was a good boy , which , being compelled to be my own trumpeter , I very modestly declared that I was .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 18]: My mother , who was standing up behind , lifted up her eyes at my barefaced assertion .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 39]: Captain Delmar then shook hands with my mother , intimating his intention of paying her another visit very soon , and again patting me on the head , quitted the parlour , and went away through the shop .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 28]: As soon as Captain Delmar was gone , my mother turned round , and said , `` You naughty , mischievous boy , to play such pranks .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 18]: I 'll have that dog killed , without you promise me never to do so again . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 8]: `` Do what again , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 9]: `` None of your pretended innocence with me .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 12]: I 've been told of the pigtail that Bob pulls at .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 33]: That 's all very well at the barracks with the marines , sir , but do you know _ who _ it is that you have been playing that trick to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 8]: `` No mother , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 5]: Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 9]: `` Who is he , you undutiful child ?
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 13]: why , he 's -- he 's the Honourable Captain Delmar . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 8]: `` Well , what of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 14]: replied I. `` He 's a naval captain , ai n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 19]: `` Yes ; but he 's the nephew of the lady who brought me up and educated me .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 32]: It was he that made the match between me and our father : so if it had not been for him , child , you never would have been born . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 36]: `` Oh that 's it , '' replied I. `` Well , mother , if it had not been for me , he 'd never have come into the shop , and found you . ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 75]: `` But , my child , we must be serious ; you must be very respectful to Captain Delmar , and play no tricks with him ; for you may see him very often , and , perhaps , he will take a fancy to you ; and if he does , he may do you a great deal of good , and bring you forward in the world ; so promise me . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 19]: `` Well , mother , I 'll promise you I 'll leave him alone if you wish it .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 32]: Law , mother , you should have seen how the middy laughed at him ; it was real fun to make a gallant captain run in the way he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 55]: `` Go along , you mischievous animal , and recollect your promise to me , '' said my mother , as she went into the shop where she found that Captain Bridgeman , to whom she intended to explain how it was that she had dropped the tumbler of water , had gone away .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 50]: There was a great deal of consultation between my grandmother and my mother on that evening ; my aunt and I were sent out to to take a walk , that we might not overhear what passed , and when we returned we found them still in close conversation .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 21]: The Honourable Captain Delmar was now a frequent visitor to my mother , and a good customer to the library .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 62]: He did , however , generally contrive that his visit should be paid late in the afternoon , just after the marine officers had retired to dress for dinner ; for he was a very haughty personage , and did not think it proper for any officers of an inferior grade to come `` between the wind and his nobility . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 31]: I can not say that I was partial to him ; indeed , his pomposity , as I considered it , was to me a source of ridicule and dislike .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 92]: He took more notice of me than he did of anybody else ; but he appeared to consider that his condescending patronage was all that was necessary ; whereas , had he occasionally given me a half-crown I should have cherished better feelings towards him : not that I wanted money , for my mother supplied me very liberally , considering my age : but although you may coax and flatter a girl into loving you , you can not a boy , who requires more substantial proofs of your good-will .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 103]: There were a great many remarks not very flattering to my mother , made behind her back , as to her former intimacy with Captain Delmar ; for , somehow or another , there always is somebody who knows something , wherever doubts or surmises arise , and so it was in this case ; but if people indulged in ill-natured remarks when she was not there , they did not in her presence ; on the contrary , the friendship of so great a man as the Honourable Captain Delmar appeared rather to make my mother a person of more consequence .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 110]: She was continually pointing out to me the propriety of securing the good will of this great personage , and the more she did so , the more I felt inclined to do the reverse ; indeed , I should have broke out into open mutiny , if it had not been for Captain Bridgeman , who sided with my mother , and when I went to him to propose playing another trick upon the noble captain , not only refused to aid me , but told me , if I ever thought of such a thing , he would never allow me to come to his rooms again .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 12]: `` Why , what good can he do to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: inquired I. `` He may advance you properly in life -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 18]: -- he may put you on the quarter-deck , and get you promoted in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 10]: `` What , make a middy of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 69]: `` Yes , and from a midshipman you may rise to be a post-captain , or admiral , -- a much greater rank than I shall ever obtain , '' said Captain Bridgeman ; `` so take my advice , and do as your mother wishes ; be very civil and respectful to Captain Delmar , and he may be as good as a father to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 29]: `` That 's not saying much , '' replied I , thinking of my father Ben ; `` I 'd rather have two mothers than two fathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 6]: And here the conversation ended .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 46]: I had contracted a great alliance with Mr Dott , the midshipman , who followed Captain Delmar about , just as Bob used to follow me , and generally remained in the shop or outside with me , when his captain called upon my mother .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 42]: He was a little wag , as full of mischief as myself , and even his awe of his captain , which , as a youngster in the service , was excessive , would not prevent him from occasionally breaking out .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 79]: My mother took great notice of him , and when he could obtain leave -LRB- which , indeed , she often asked for him -RRB- , invited him to come to our house , when he became my companion during his stay ; we would sally out together , and vie with each other in producing confusion and mirth at other people 's expense ; we became the abhorrence of every old fruit-woman and beggar in the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 30]: Captain Delmar heard occasionally of my pranks , and looked very majestic and severe ; but as I was not a middy , I cared little for his frowns .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 54]: At last an opportunity offered which I could not resist ; and , not daring to make known my scheme either to Captain Bridgeman or Aunt Milly , I confided it to Tommy Dott , the little middy , who , regardless of the consequences , joined me in it heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 15]: The theatre had been opened at Chatham , and had met with indifferent success .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 26]: I went there once with my aunt Milly , and twice with Mr Dott ; I , therefore , knew my _ locale _ well .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 59]: It appeared that one of the female performers , whose benefit was shortly to take place , was very anxious to obtain the patronage of Captain Delmar , and , with the usual tact of women , had applied to my mother in the most obsequious manner , requesting her to espouse her cause with the gallant captain .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 99]: My mother , pleased with the idea of becoming , as it were , a patroness under the rose , did so effectually exert her influence over the captain , that , in a day or two afterwards , play-bills were posted all over the town , announcing that the play of _ The Stranger _ , with the farce of _ Raising the Wind _ , would be performed on Friday evening , for the benefit of Miss Mortimer under the patronage of the Honourable Captain Delmar , and the officers of his Majesty 's ship Calliope .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 26]: Of course the grateful young lady sent my mother some tickets of admission , and two of them I reserved for Tommy Dott and myself .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 31]: Captain Delmar had made a large party of ladies , and of course all the officers of the ship attended : the house was as full as it could hold .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 60]: My mother and aunt were there in a retired part of the boxes ; Tommy Dott and I entered the theatre with them , and afterwards had gone up to what is , at the theatres at seaports , usually denominated the slips , that is , the sides of the theatre on the same range as the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 43]: There was Captain Delmar with all his ladies and all his officers , occupying nearly the whole of the side of the dress circle below us , we having taken our position above him , so that we might not be observed .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 4]: The performance commenced .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 39]: Miss Mortimer , as _ Mrs Haller _ , was very effective ; and in the last scene was compelling the eyes of the company to water , when we thought we would produce a still greater effect .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 44]: We had purchased a pound of the finest Scotch snuff , which we had enclosed in two pasteboard cases , similar in form to those of squibs , only about six times the size , and holding half a pound of snuff each .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 48]: Our object was , in doing this , that , by jerking it all out with a heave , we might at once throw it right into the centre of the theatre above , so that in its descent it might be fairly distributed among all parties .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 38]: There was no one in the slips with us , except midshipmen , and a description of people who would consider it a good joke , and never would peach if they perceived we were the culprits .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 37]: At a signal between us , just as _ Mrs Haller _ was giving a paper to her husband did we give our shower of snuff to the audience , jerking it right across the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 74]: In a few minutes the effect was prodigious ; Captain Delmar 's party being right beneath us , probably received a greater share , for they commenced sneezing fast , then the boxes on the other side , the pit followed , and at last _ Mr and Mrs Haller _ and the _ Stranger _ were taken with such a fit of sneezing that they could no longer talk to each other .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 53]: The children were brought out to their parents to effect their reconciliation , but they did nothing but sneeze , poor things ; and at last the uproar was tremendous , and the curtain was dropped , not to loud plaudits , but to loud sneezings from every part of the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 103]: Never was there anything so ludicrous ; the manager sent officers up to discover the offenders but no one could tell who had played the trick ; he then came before the curtain to make a speech upon the occasion , but , having sneezed seven or eight times , he was obliged to retire with his handkerchief to his nose ; and the audience , finding it impossible to check the titillation of the olfactory nerves , abandoned the theatre as fast as they could , leaving the farce of _ Raising the Wind _ to be performed to empty beaches .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 57]: I hardly need say , that as soon as we had thrown the snuff , Mr Dott and I had gone down and taken our places very demurely in the box by the side of my mother , and appeared just as astonished , and indeed added as much as possible to the company of sneezers .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 47]: Captain Delmar was very furious at this want of respect of certain parties unknown , and had we been discovered , whatever might have been my fate , it would have gone hard with Tommy Dott ; but we kept our own counsel , and escaped .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 47]: That I was suspected by Aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman is certain , and my aunt taxed me with it , but I would not confess ; my mother also had her suspicions , but as Captain Delmar had none , that was of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 19]: The success of this trick was a great temptation to try another or two upon the noble captain .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 53]: He was , however saved by the simple fact of H.M. ship Calliope being reported manned and ready for sea ; orders were sent down for his going round to Portsmouth to await the commands of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty , and Captain Delmar came to pay his farewell visit .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 30]: The report from the schoolmaster had been very favourable and Captain Delmar then asked me , for the first time , if I would like to be a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 57]: As Captain Bridgeman had advised me not to reject any good offer on the part of the honourable captain , I answered in the affirmative ; whereupon the captain replied , that if I paid attention to my learning , in a year 's time he would take me with him on board of his frigate .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 46]: He then patted my head , forgot to give me half a crown , and , shaking hands with my mother and aunt , quitted the house , followed by Tommy Dott , who , as he went away , turned and laughed his adieu .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 8]: I have not mentioned my grandmother lately .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 43]: The fact is , that when Captain Delmar made his appearance , for some cause or another , which I could not comprehend , she declared her intention of going away and paying a visit to her old acquaintances at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 4]: She did so .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 33]: As I afterwards found out from what I overheard , she had a very great aversion to the noble captain : but the cause of her aversion was never communicated to me .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 30]: Soon after the sailing of the Calliope , she again made her appearance , took her old seat in the easy-chair , and resumed her eternal knitting as before .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 62]: Another year of my existence passed rapidly away ; I was nearly thirteen years old , a sturdy bold boy , well fitted for the naval profession , which I now considered decided upon , and began to be impatient to leave school , and wondered that we heard nothing of Captain Delmar , when news was received from another quarter .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 23]: One morning Captain Bridgeman came much earlier than usual , and with a very grave face put on especially for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 39]: I had not set off for school , and ran up to him ; but he checked me , and said , `` I must see your mother directly , I have very important news for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 52]: I went in to tell my mother , who requested Captain Bridgeman to come into the parlour , and not being aware of the nature of the communication , ordered Aunt Milly and me into the shop ; we waited for some minutes , and then Captain Bridgeman made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 3]: said Milly .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 41]: `` Read this newspaper , '' said he ; `` there is a despatch from India , it will tell you all about it , and you can show it to your sister , when she is more composed . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 40]: Curious to know what the matter could be , I quitted the shop , and went into the parlour , where I saw my mother with her face buried in the sofa pillow , and apparently in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 5]: said I. `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 7]: my child , my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 22]: replied my mother , wringing her hands , `` you are an orphan , and I am a lonely widow . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 8]: said I. `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 24]: said my grandmother , `` why , are you such a fool , as not to understand that your father is dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 9]: `` Father 's dead , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 31]: replied I , `` I 'll go and tell Aunt Milly ; '' and away I went out of the parlour to Milly , whom I found reading the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 16]: `` Aunt , '' said I , `` father 's dead , only to think !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 7]: I wonder how he died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 31]: `` He was killed in action , dear , '' said my aunt ; `` look here , here is the account , and the list of killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 13]: D'ye see your father 's name -- Benjamin Keene , marine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 34]: `` Let me read all about it , Aunt Milly , '' replied I , taking the paper from her ; and I was soon very busy with the account of the action .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 117]: My readers must not suppose that I had no feeling , because I showed none at my father 's death ; if they call to mind the humble position in which I had always seen my father , who dared not even intrude upon the presence of those with whom my mother and I were on familiar terms , and that he was ordered about just like a servant by my mother , who set me no example of fear or love for him , they will easily imagine that I felt less for his death than I should have for that of Captain Bridgeman , or many others with whom I was on intimate terms .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 18]: What did puzzle me was , that my mother should show so much feeling on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 18]: I did not know the world then , and that decency required a certain display of grief .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 20]: Aunt Milly appeared to be very unconcerned about it , although , occasionally , she was in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 34]: I put down the paper as soon as I had read the despatch , and said to her , `` Well , I suppose I must go to school now , aunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 44]: `` Oh no , dear , '' replied she , `` you ca n't go to school for a few days now -- it would n't be proper ; you must remain at home and wait till you have put on mourning . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 39]: `` I 'm glad of that , at all events , '' replied I ; `` I wonder where Captain Delmar is , and why he do n't send for me ; I begin to hate school . ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 39]: `` I dare say it wo n't be long before you hear from him , dear , '' replied my aunt ; `` stay here and mind the shop , while I go in to your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 29]: If the truth was told , I am afraid that the death of Ben was a source of congratulation to all parties who were then in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 28]: As for me , I was very glad to have a few days ' holiday , being perfectly indifferent as to whether he was dead or alive .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 56]: When I went in I found them in consultation as to the mourning : my mother did not , in the first place , wish to make any a parade about a husband of whom she was ashamed ; in the second , she did not like widow 's weeds , and the unbecoming cap .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 61]: So it was decided , as Ben had been dead six months , and if they had known it before they would have been in mourning for him all that time , that half-mourning was all that was requisite for them ; and that , as for me , there was no reason for my going into mourning at all .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 65]: Three days after the intelligence , my mother re-appeared in the shop ; the reason why she did not appear before was , that her dress was not ready -- she looked very pretty indeed in half-mourning , so did my Aunt Milly ; and the attentions of the marine corps , especially Captain Bridgeman and Lieutenant Flat , were more unremitting than ever .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 55]: It appeared that , as the death of Ben had removed the great difficulty to my aunt 's being married to an officer , my grandmother had resolved to ascertain the intentions of Captain Bridgeman , and if she found that he cried off , to persuade Milly to consent to become Mrs Flat .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 24]: Whether she consulted my mother or my aunt on this occasion , I can not positively say , but I rather think not .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 66]: My mother and my aunt were walking out one evening , when Captain Bridgeman came in , and my grandmother , who remained in the shop whenever my mother and Milly went out together , which was very seldom , requested him to walk into the back parlour , desiring me to remain in the shop , and let her know if she was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 69]: Now when they went into the parlour , the door was left ajar , and , as I remained at the back part of the shop , I could not help over-hearing every word which was said ; for my grandmother being very deaf , as most deaf people do , talked quite as loud as Captain Bridgeman was compelled to do , to make her hear him .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 27]: `` I wish , Captain Bridgeman , as a friend , to ask your advice relative to my daughter Amelia , '' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 8]: `` Please to take a chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 35]: `` If there is any opinion that I can offer on the subject , madam , I shall be most happy to give it , '' replied the captain , sitting down as requested .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 76]: `` You see , my daughter Amelia has been well brought up , and carefully educated , as was , indeed , my daughter , Arabella , through the kindness of my old patron , Mrs Delmar , the aunt of the Honourable Captain Delmar , whom you have often met here , and who is heir to the title of de Versely ; that is to say , his eldest brother has no children .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 97]: I have been nearly fifty years in the family as a confidential , Captain Bridgeman ; the old lord was very fond of my husband , who was his steward , but he died , poor man , a long while ago ; I am sure it would have broken his heart , if , in his lifetime , my daughter Arabella had made the foolish marriage which she did with a private marine -- however , what 's done ca n't be helped , as the saying is -- that 's all over now . ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 35]: `` It was certainly a great pity that Mrs Keene should have been so foolish , '' replied Captain Bridgeman , `` but , as you say , that is all over now . ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 140]: `` Yes ; God 's will be done , Captain Bridgeman ; now you see , sir , that this marriage of Bella 's has done no good to the prospects of her sister Amelia , who , nevertheless , is a good and pretty girl though I say it , who am her mother ; and moreover , she will bring a pretty penny to her husband whoever he may be ; for you see , Captain Bridgeman , my husband was not idle during the time that he was in the family of the Delmars , and as her sister is so well to do , why little Amelia will come into a greater share than she otherwise would -- that is , if she marries well , and according to the wishes of her mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 16]: At this interesting part of the conversation Captain Bridgeman leant more earnestly towards my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 25]: `` A pretty penny , madam , you said ; I never heard the expression before ; what may a pretty penny mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 25]: `` It means , first and last , 4,000 pounds , Captain Bridgeman ; part down , and the other when I die . ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 35]: `` Indeed , '' replied Captain Bridgeman ; `` I certainly never thought that Miss Amelia would ever have any fortune ; indeed , she 's too pretty and accomplished to require any . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 78]: `` Now , sir , '' continued my grandmother , `` the point on which I wish to consult you is this : you know that Lieutenant Flat is very often here , and for a long while has been very attentive to my daughter ; he has , I believe , almost as much as proposed -- that is , in his sort of way ; but my daughter does not seem to care for him .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 99]: Now , Captain Bridgeman , Mr Flat may not be very clever , but I believe him to be a very worthy young man ; still one must be cautious , and what I wish to know before I interfere and persuade my daughter to marry him is , whether you think that Mr Flat is of a disposition which would make the marriage state a happy one ; for you see , Captain Bridgeman , love before marriage is very apt to fly away , but love that comes after marriage will last out your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 63]: `` Well , madam , '' replied the captain , `` I will be candid with you ; I do not think that a clever girl like Miss Amelia is likely to be happy as the wife of my good friend Mr Flat -- still there is nothing against his character , madam ; I believe him harmless -- very harmless . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 13]: `` He 's a very fine-looking young man , Captain Bridgeman . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 14]: `` Yes ; nothing to be found fault with in his appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 5]: `` Very good-natured . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 24]: `` Yes ; he 's not very quick in temper , or anything else ; he 's what we call a slow-coach . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 14]: `` I hear he 's a very correct officer , Captain Bridgeman . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 17]: `` Yes ; I am not aware that he has ever been under an arrest . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 43]: `` Well , we can not expect everything in this world ; he is handsome , good-tempered , and a good officer -- I can not see why Amelia does not like him , particularly as her affections are not otherwise engaged .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 36]: I am satisfied with the answer you have given , Captain Bridgeman , and now I shall point out to Amelia that I expect she will make up her mind to accept Mr Flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 5]: Here Captain Bridgeman hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 31]: `` Indeed , madam , if her affections are not otherwise engaged -- I say -- are not engaged , madam , I do not think she could do better .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 14]: Would , you like me to sound Miss Amelia on the subject ? ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 29]: `` Really , Captain Bridgeman , it is very kind of you ; you may , perhaps , persuade her to listen to your friend Mr Flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 38]: `` I will , at all events , ascertain her real sentiments , madam , '' said the captain , rising ; `` and , if you please , I will say farewell for the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 41]: As my grandmother anticipated , the scale , which had been so long balanced by Captain Bridgeman , was weighed down in favour of marriage by the death of my father Ben , and the unexpected fortune of 4,000 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 23]: The next day the captain proposed and was accepted , and six weeks from that date my aunt Milly became his wife .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 25]: The wedding was very gay : some people did sneer at the match , but where was there ever a match without a sneer ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 17]: There are always and everywhere people to be found who will envy the happiness of others .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 60]: Some talked about the private marine ; this attack was met with the 4,000 pounds -LRB- or rather 8,000 pounds per annum , for rumour , as usual , had doubled the sum -RRB- ; others talked of the shop as _ infra dig _ ; the set-off against which was , the education and beauty of the bride .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 56]: One or two subs ' wives declared that they would not visit Mrs Bridgeman ; but when the colonel and his lady called to congratulate the new-married couple , and invited a large party in their own house to meet them , then then subs ' wives left their cards as soon as they could .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 69]: In a few weeks all was right again : my mother would not give up her shop -- it was too lucrative ; but she was on more intimate terms with her customers ; and when people found that , although her sister was a captain 's lady , my mother had too much sense to be ashamed of her position ; why they liked her the better .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 52]: Indeed , as she was still very handsome , one or two of the marine officers , now that she was a widow , paid her very assiduous court ; but my mother had no intention of entering again into the holy state -- she preferred STATE _ in quo _ .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 41]: She had no one to care for but me , and for me she continued her shop and library , although , I believe , she could have retired upon a comfortable independence , had she chosen so to do .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 20]: My mother , whatever she might have been when a girl , was now a strong-minded , clever woman .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 84]: It must have been a painful thing for her to have made up her mind to allow me to go to sea ; I was her only child , her only care ; I believe she loved me dearly , although she was not so lavish of her caresses as my aunt Milly ; but she perceived that it would be for my advantage that I should insure the patronage and protection of Captain Delmar , and she sacrificed self to my interest .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 58]: About a month after my aunt 's marriage , a letter was received from Captain Delmar , who had arrived at Spithead , requesting my mother to send me to Portsmouth as soon as she could , and not go to the trouble or expense of fitting me out , as he would take that upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 39]: This was but short notice to give a fond mother , but there was no help for it ; she returned an answer , that in three days from the date of the letter I should be there .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 43]: I was immediately summoned from school that she might see as much of me as possible before I went ; and although she did not attempt to detain me , I perceived , very often , the tears run down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 159]: My grandmother thought proper to make me very long speeches every three or four hours , the substance of which may be comprehended in very few words -- to wit , that I had been a very bad boy , and that I was little better now ; that I had been spoiled by over-indulgence , and that it was lucky my aunt Milly was not so much with me ; that on board a man-of-war I dare not play tricks , and that I would find it very different from being at home with my mother ; that Captain Delmar was a very great man , and that I must be very respectful to him ; that some day I should thank her very much for her being so kind to me ; that she hoped I would behave well , and that if I did not , she hoped that I would get a good beating .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 41]: Such was the burden of her song , till at last I got very tired of it , and on the third evening I broke away from her , saying , `` Law , granny how you do twaddle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 20]: upon which she called me a good-for-nothing young blackguard , and felt positively sure that I should be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 34]: The consequence was , that granny and I did not part good friends ; and I sincerely hoped that when I had come back again , I should not find her above ground .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 53]: The next morning I bade farewell to my dear Aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman , received a very ungracious salute from granny , who appeared to think , as she kissed me , that her lips were touching something poisonous , and set off with my mother in the coach to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 19]: We arrived safe at Portsmouth , and my mother immediately took lodgings on the Common Hard at Portsea .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 39]: The next day , having dressed herself with great care , with a very thick veil on her bonnet , my mother walked with me to the George Hotel , where Captain Delmar had taken up his quarters .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 47]: On my mother sending up her card , we were immediately ushered upstairs , and on entering the room found the Honourable Captain Delmar sitting down in full uniform -- his sword , and hat , and numerous papers , lying on the table before him .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 30]: On one side of the table stood a lieutenant , hat in hand ; on the other , the captain 's clerk , with papers for him to sign .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 36]: My friend Tommy Dott was standing at the window , chasing a blue-bottle fly , for want of something better to do ; and the steward was waiting for orders behind the captain 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 58]: My mother , who had pulled down her veil , so that her face was not visible , made a slight courtesy to Captain Delmar , who rose up and advanced to receive her very graciously , requesting that she would be seated for a minute or two , till he had time to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 34]: I have thought since , that my honourable captain had a mind to impress upon my mother the state and dignity of a captain in his Majesty 's service , when in commission .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: He took no notice whatever of me .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 43]: Tommy Dott gave me a wink of his eye from the window , and I returned the compliment by putting my tongue into my cheek ; but the other parties were too much occupied with the captain to perceive our friendly recognition .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 18]: Captain Delmar continued to give various orders , and after a time the officers attending were dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 33]: As soon as we were alone , my mother was addressed in , I thought , rather a pompous way , and very much in contrast with his previous politeness before others .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 32]: Captain Delmar informed her that he should take me immediately under his protection , pay all my expenses , and , if I behaved well , advance me in the service .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 36]: At this announcement , my mother expressed a great deal of gratitude , and , shedding a few tears , said , that the boy would in future look up to him as a parent .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 85]: To this speech Captain Delmar made no reply ; but , changing the conversation , told her that he expected to sail in about three or four days , and that no time must be lost in fitting me out ; that , all things considered , he thought it advisable that she should return at once to Chatham , and leave the boy with him as she could not know what was requisite for me , and would therefore be of no use .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 13]: At the idea of parting with me , my mother cried bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 25]: Captain Delmar did then rise off his chair , and taking my mother by the hand speak to her a few words of consolation .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 25]: My mother removed her handkerchief from her eyes and sighed deeply , saying to Captain Delmar , with an appealing look , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 34]: Captain Delmar , remember that for you I have indeed made great sacrifices ; do not forget them , when you look at that boy , who is very dear to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 118]: `` I will do him justice , '' replied the captain , somewhat affected , `` but I must insist upon inviolable secrecy on your part ; you must promise me that under any circumstances -- '' `` I have obeyed you for thirteen years , '' replied my mother ; `` I am not likely to forget my promise now ; it is hard to part with him , but I leave him in the hands of -- '' `` You forget the boy is there , '' interrupted Captain Delmar ; `` take him away now ; to-morrow morning I will send my coxswain for him , and you must go back to Chatham . ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 28]: `` God bless you , sir , '' replied my mother , weeping , as Captain Delmar shook her hand , and then we left the room .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 29]: As we were walking back to our lodging , I inquired of my mother -- `` What 's the secret between you and Captain Delmar , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 6]: `` The secret , child !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 36]: Oh , something which took place at the time I was living with his aunt , and which he does not wish to have known ; so ask me no more questions about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 14]: After our return , my mother gave me a great deal of advice .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 121]: She told me that , as I had lost my father Ben , I must now look upon Captain Delmar as a father to me ; that Ben had been a faithful servant to the captain , and that she had been the same to Mrs Delmar , his aunt ; and that was the reason why Captain Delmar was interested about me , and had promised to do so much for me ; begging me to treat him with great respect and never venture to play him any tricks , or otherwise he would be highly offended , and send me home again ; and then I should never rise to be an officer in his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 60]: I can not say the advice received the attention it deserved , for I felt more inclined to play tricks to my honourable captain than any person I ever met with ; however , I appeared to consent , and , in return begged my mother to take care of my dog Bob , which she promised to do .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 43]: My mother cried a great deal during the night ; the next morning she gave me five guineas as pocket-money , recommending me to be careful of it , and telling me I must look to Captain Delmar for my future supply .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 37]: She tied up the little linen I had brought with me in a handkerchief , and shortly after the coxswain knocked at the door , and came upstairs to claim me for his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 33]: `` I 'm come for the youngster , if you please , marm , '' said the coxswain , a fine , tall seaman , remarkably clean and neat in his dress .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 13]: My mother put her arms round me , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 36]: `` I beg your pardon , marm , '' said the coxswain , after standing silent about a minute , `` but could not you _ do the piping _ after the youngster 's gone ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 24]: If I stay here long I shall be blowed up by the skipper , as sure as my name 's Bob Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 25]: `` I will detain you but a few seconds longer , '' replied my mother ; `` I may never see him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 20]: `` Well , that 's a fact ; my poor mother never did me , '' replied the coxswain .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 10]: This observation did not raise my mother 's spirits .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 60]: Another pause ensued , during which I was bedewed with her tears , when the coxswain approached again -- `` I ax your pardon , marm ; but if you know anything of Captain Delmar , you must know he 's not a man to be played with , and you would not wish to get me into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 29]: It 's a hard thing to part with a child , I 'm told , but it would n't help me if I said anything about your tears .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 30]: If the captain were to go to the boat , and find me not there , he 'd just say , ` What were my orders , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 20]: and after that , you know , marm , there is not a word for me to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 35]: `` Take him , then , my good man , '' replied my mother , pressing me convulsively to her heart -- `` take him ; Heaven bless you , my dear child . ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 16]: `` Thanky , marm ; that 's kind of you , '' replied the coxswain .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 17]: `` Come , my little fellow , we 'll soon make a man of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 37]: I once more pressed my lips to my poor mother 's , and she resigned me to the coxswain , at the same time taking some silver off the table and putting it into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 27]: `` Thanky , marm ; that 's kinder still , to think of another when you 're in distress yourself ; I sha n't forget it .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 21]: I 'll look after the lad a bit for you , as sure as my name 's Bob Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 15]: My mother sank down on the sofa , with her handkerchief to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 12]: Bob Cross caught up the bundle , and led me away .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 31]: I was very melancholy , for I loved my mother , and could not bear to see her so distressed , and for some time we walked on without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 19]: The coxswain first broke the silence : -- `` What 's your name , my little Trojan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 5]: `` Percival Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 40]: `` Well I 'm blessed if I did n't think that you were one of the Delmar breed , by the cut of your jib ; howsomever , it 's a wise child that knows its own father . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 11]: `` Father 's dead , '' replied I. `` Dead !
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 17]: Well , fathers do die sometimes ; you must get on how you can without one .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 30]: I do n't think fathers are of much use , for , you see , mothers take care of you till you 're old enough to go to sea .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 21]: My father did nothing for me , except to help mother to lick me , when I was obstropolous . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 30]: The reader , from what he has already been informed about Ben , the marine , may easily conceive that I was very much of Bob Cross 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 15]: `` I suppose you do n't know anybody on board -- do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 19]: `` Yes , I know Tommy Dott -- I knew him when the ship was at Chatham . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 20]: Mr Tommy Dott ; I dare say you 're just like him , for you look full of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 64]: He 's a very nice young man for a small party , as the saying is ; there is more devil in his little carcase than in two women 's , and that 's not a trifle ; you 'll hunt in couples , I dare say , and get well flogged at the same gun , if you do n't take care .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 18]: Now , here we are , and I must report my arrival with you under convoy . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 18]: Bob Cross sent a waiter for the captain 's steward , who went up to Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 31]: I was ordered to go upstairs , and again found myself in the presence of the noble captain , and a very stout elderly man , with a flaxen wig .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 48]: `` This is the lad , '' said Captain Delmar , when I came into the room and walked up to him ; `` you know exactly what he requires ; oblige me by seeing him properly fitted out and the bill sent in to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 22]: `` Your orders shall be strictly obeyed , Captain Delmar , '' said the old gentleman , with a profound bow .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 32]: `` You had better not order too many things , as he is growing fast ; it will be easy to make good any deficiencies as they may be required . ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 22]: `` Your orders shall be most strictly obeyed , Captain Delmar , '' replied the old gentleman , with another bow .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 35]: `` I hardly know what to do with him for to-day and to-morrow , until his uniforms are made , '' continued the captain : `` I suppose he must go on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 71]: `` If you have no objection , Captain Delmar , '' said the old gentleman , with another low bow , `` I am sure that Mrs Culpepper will be most proud to take charge of any _ protege _ of yours ; we have a spare bed , and the young gentleman can remain with us until he is ready to embark in the uniform of his rank . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 26]: `` Be it so , Mr Culpepper ; let your wife take care of him until all is complete , and his chest is ready .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 11]: You 'll oblige me by arranging about his mess . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 33]: `` Your wishes shall be most strictly attended to , Captain Delmar , '' replied Mr Culpepper , with another profound inclination , which made me feel very much inclined to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 22]: `` If you have no further orders , Captain Delmar , I will now take the young gentleman with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 41]: `` Nothing more , Mr Culpepper -- good morning , '' replied Captain Delmar , who neither said how d'ye do to me when I came in , or good bye when I went away in company with Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 18]: I had yet to learn what a thing of no consequence was a `` sucking Nelson . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 32]: I followed Mr Culpepper down stairs , who desired me to remain with the coxswain , who was standing under the archway , while he spoke to the captain 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 26]: `` Well , '' said Bob Cross , `` what 's the ticket , youngster , -- are you to go abroad with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 30]: `` No , '' said I ; `` I am to stay on shore with that old chap , who does nothing but bob his head up and down .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 5]: Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 7]: `` That 's our nipcheese . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 4]: `` Nipcheese ! ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 51]: `` Yes ; nipcheese means purser of the ship -- you 'll find all that out by-and-by ; you 've got lots to larn , and , by way of a hint , make him your friend if you can , for he earwigs the captain in fine style . ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 64]: Perceiving that I did not understand him , Bob Cross continued : `` I mean that our captain 's very fond of the officers paying him great respect , and he likes all that bowing and scraping ; he do n't like officers or men to touch their hats , but to take them right off their heads when they speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 47]: You see , he 's a sprig of nobility , as they call it , and what 's more he 's also a post-captain , and thinks no small beer of himself ; so do n't forget what I say -- here comes the purser . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 25]: Mr Culpepper now came out , and , taking my hand , led me away to his own house , which was at Southsea .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 26]: He did not speak a word during the walk , but appeared to be in deep cogitation : at last we arrived at his door .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 15]: Why is it that I detain the reader with Mr Culpepper and his family ?
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 81]: I do n't know , but I certainly have an inclination to linger over every little detail of events which occurred upon my first plunging into the sea of life , just as naked boys on the New River side stand shivering a while , before they can make up their minds to dash into the unnatural element ; for men are not ducks , although they do show some affinity to geese by their venturing upon the treacherous fluid .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 57]: The door was opened , and I found myself in the presence of Mrs Culpepper and her daughter , -- the heiress , as I afterwards discovered , to all Mr Culpepper 's savings , which were asserted to be something considerable after thirty years ' employment as purser of various vessels belonging to his Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 44]: Mrs Culpepper was in person enormous -- she looked like a feather-bed standing on end ; her cheeks were as large as a dinner-plate , eyes almost as imperceptible as a mole 's , nose just visible , mouth like a round O .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 12]: It was said that she was once a great Devonshire beauty .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 32]: Time , who has been denominated _ Edax rerum _ , certainly had as yet left her untouched , reserving her for a _ bonne bouche _ on some future occasion .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 20]: She sat in a very large arm-chair -- indeed , no common-sized chair could have received her capacious person .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 54]: She did not get up when I entered ; indeed , as I discovered , she made but two attempts to stand during the twenty-four hours ; one was to come out of her bedroom , which was on the same floor as the parlour , and the other to go in again .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 10]: Miss Culpepper was somewhat of her mother 's build .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 65]: She might have been twenty years old , and was , for a girl of her age , exuberantly fat ; yet as her skin and complexion were not coarse , many thought her handsome ; but she promised to be as large as her mother , and certainly was not at all suited for a wife to a subaltern of a marching regiment .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 7]: `` Who have we here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 30]: said Mrs Culpepper to her husband , in a sort of low croak ; for she was so smothered with fat that she could not get her voice out .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 25]: `` Well , I hardly know , '' replied the gentleman , wiping his forehead ; `` but I 've my own opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 10]: `` Mercy on me , how very like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 14]: exclaimed Miss Culpepper , looking at me , and then at her father .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 15]: `` Would not you like to go into the garden , little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 23]: continued she : `` there , through the passage , out of the door , -- you ca n't miss it . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 73]: As this was almost a command , I did not refuse to go ; but as soon as I was in the garden , which was a small patch of ground behind the house , as the window to the parlour was open , and my curiosity was excited by their evidently wishing to say something which they did not wish me to hear , I stopped under the window and listened .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 13]: `` The very picture of him , '' continued the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 15]: `` Yes , yes , very like indeed , '' croaked the old one .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 31]: `` All I know is , '' said Mr Culpepper , `` Captain Delmar has desired me to fit him out , and that he pays all the expenses . ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 26]: `` Well , that 's another proof , '' said the young lady ; `` he would n't pay for other people 's children . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 29]: `` He was brought down here by a very respectable-looking , I may say interesting , and rather pretty woman , -- I should think about thirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 26]: `` Then she must have been handsome when this boy was born , '' replied the young lady : `` I consider that another proof .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 5]: Where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 24]: `` Went away this morning by the day-coach , leaving the boy with the captain , who sent his coxswain for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 22]: `` There 's mystery about that , '' rejoined the daughter , `` and therefore I consider it another proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' said Mr Culpepper , `` and a strong one too .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 48]: Captain Delmar is so high and mighty , that he would not have it thought that he could ever condescend to have an intrigue with one beneath him in rank and station , and he has sent her away on that account , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 23]: `` Just so ; and if that boy is not a son of Captain Delmar , I 'm not a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 41]: `` I am of that opinion , '' replied the father , `` and therefore I offered to take charge of him , as the captain did not know what to do with him till his uniform was ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 16]: `` Well , '' replied Miss Culpepper , `` I 'll soon find out more .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 26]: I 'll pump everything that he knows out of him before he leaves us ; I know how to put that and that together . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' croaked the fat mother ; `` Medea knows how to put that and that together , as well as any one . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 49]: `` You must be very civil and very kind to him , '' said Mr Culpepper ; `` for depend upon it , the very circumstance of the captain 's being compelled to keep the boy at a distance will make him feel more fond of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 50]: `` I 've no patience with the men in that respect , '' observed the young lady : `` how nobility can so demean themselves I ca n't think ; no wonder they are ashamed of what they have done , and will not acknowledge their own offspring . ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 11]: `` No , indeed , '' croaked the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 27]: `` If a woman has the misfortune to yield to her inclinations , they do n't let her off so easily , '' exclaimed Miss Medea .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 11]: `` No , indeed , '' croaked the mamma again .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 14]: `` Men make the laws and break them , '' continued Miss Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 12]: `` Mere brute strength , even in the most civilised society .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 23]: If all women had only the spirit that I have , there would be a little alteration , and more justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 34]: `` I ca n't pretend to argue with you , Medea , '' replied Mr Culpepper ; `` I take the world as I find it , and make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 17]: I must go now , -- my steward is waiting for me at the victualling office .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 24]: Just brush my hat a little , Medea , the wind has raised the nap , and then I 'll be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 16]: I walked very softly from the window ; a new light had burst upon me .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 14]: Young as I was , I also could put that and that together .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 158]: I called to mind the conduct of my mother towards her husband Ben ; the dislike of my grandmother to Captain Delmar ; the occasional conversations I had overheard ; the question of my mother checked before it was finished -- `` If I knew who it was that I had been playing the trick to ; '' the visits my mother received from Captain Delmar , who was so haughty and distant to everybody ; his promise to provide for me , and my mother 's injunctions to me to be obedient and look up to him as a father , and the remarks of the coxswain , Bob Cross , -- `` If I were not of the Delmar breed : '' all this , added to what I had just overheard , satisfied me that they were not wrong in their conjectures , and that I really was the son of the honourable captain .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 48]: My mother had gone ; I would have given worlds to have gained this information before , that I might have questioned her , and obtained the truth from her ; but that was now impossible , and I felt convinced that writing was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 141]: I recollected the conversation between her and the Captain , in which she promised to keep the secret , and the answer she gave me when I questioned her ; nothing , then , but my tears and entreaties could have any effect , and those , I knew , were powerful over her ; neither would it be of any use to ask Aunt Milly , for she would not tell her sister 's secrets , so I resolved to say nothing about it for the present ; and I did not forget that Mr Culpepper had said that Captain Delmar would be annoyed if it was supposed that I was his son ; I resolved , therefore , that I would not let him imagine that I knew anything about it , or had any idea of it .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 27]: I remained more than an hour in deep thought , and it was strange what a tumult there was in my young heart at this discovery .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 45]: I hardly comprehended the nature of my position , yet I felt pleased on the whole ; I felt as if I were of more importance ; nay , that I was more capable of thinking and acting than I was twenty-four hours before .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 37]: My reveries were , however , disturbed by Miss Medea , who came to the back-door and asked me if I was not tired of walking , and if I would not like to come in .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 9]: `` Are you not hungry , Master Keene ?
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 19]: Would you like to have a nice piece of cake and a glass of currant wine before dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: We shall not dine till three o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 28]: `` If you please , '' replied I : for I would not refuse the bribe , although I had a perfect knowledge why it was offered .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 8]: Miss Medea brought the cake and wine .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 38]: As soon as I had despatched them , which did not take very long , she commenced her pumping , as I had anticipated , and which I was determined to thwart , merely out of opposition .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 17]: `` You were sorry to leave your mamma , were n't you , Master Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 9]: `` Yes ; very sorry , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 8]: `` Where 's your papa , dearest ?
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 14]: He 's a very pretty boy , mamma , ai n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 13]: continued the young lady , putting her fingers through my chestnut curls .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 12]: `` Yes ; handsome boy , '' croaked the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 6]: `` Papa 's dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 3]: `` Dead !
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 14]: I thought so , '' observed Miss Medea , winking at her mother .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 11]: `` Did you ever see your papa , dearest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 21]: `` Oh yes ; he went to sea about eighteen months ago , and he was killed in action . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 40]: After this came on a series of questions and cross-questions ; I replied to her so as to make it appear that Ben was my father , and nobody else , although I had then a very different opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 50]: The fact was , I was determined that I would not be pumped , and I puzzled them , for I stated that my aunt Milly was married to Captain Bridgeman , of the marines ; and not till then did Miss Medea ask me what my father was .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 29]: My reply was that he had also been in the marines , and they consequently put him down as a marine officer , as well as Captain Bridgeman .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 37]: This added so much to the respectability of my family , that they were quite mystified , and found that it was not quite so easy to put that and that together as they had thought .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 85]: As soon as they were tired of questioning , they asked me if I would not like to take another turn in the garden , to which I consented ; and , placing myself under the window as before , I heard Miss Medea say to her mother -- `` Father 's always finding out some mare 's nest or another ; and because there is some likeness to the captain , he has , in his great wit , made an important discovery .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 14]: It 's quite evident that he 's wrong , as he generally is .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 30]: It 's not very likely that Captain Delmar should have had an intrigue with the wife of a marine officer , and her sister married also into the corps .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 32]: The widow has brought him down herself , it is true , but that proves nothing ; who else was to bring him down , if it was not his mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 46]: and the very circumstance of her going away so soon proves that she felt it improper that she should remain ; and , in my opinion , that she is a modest , interesting young woman , in whom Captain Delmar has taken an interest .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 22]: I wish father would not come here with his nonsensical ideas , telling us to make much of the boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 22]: `` Very true , Medea , '' replied the mother ; `` you might have saved that cake and wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 23]: Thinks I to myself , you have not pumped me , and I never felt more delighted than at having outwitted them .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 14]: I thought it , however , prudent to walk away from the window .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 17]: Shortly afterwards , Mr Culpepper returned , accompanied by one of the numerous Portsmouth fitting-out tailors .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 24]: I was summoned ; the tailor presented a list of what he declared to be absolutely necessary for the outfit of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 26]: Mr Culpepper struck out two-thirds of the articles , and desired the remainder to be ready on the Friday morning , it being then Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 29]: The tailor promised faithfully , and Mr Culpepper also promised most faithfully , that if the articles were not ready , they would be left on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 25]: As soon as the tailor had gone , Miss Medea asked me if I would not like to take another run in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 20]: I knew that she wished to speak to her father , and therefore had a pleasure in disappointing her .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 24]: I therefore replied , that I had been there nearly the whole day , and did not wish to go out any more .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 23]: `` Never mind whether you wish it or not ; I wish you to go , '' replied Miss Medea , tartly .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 11]: `` Medea , how can you be so rude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 14]: cried Mr Culpepper ; `` surely Mr Keene may do as he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 9]: I 'm surprised at you , Medea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 27]: `` And I 'm surprised at you , papa , finding out a mystery when there is none , '' replied Miss Medea , very cross .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 20]: `` All you said this morning , and all your surmises , have turned out to be all moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 16]: Yes , you may look , papa ; I tell you -- all moonshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 16]: `` Why , Medea , what nonsense you are talking , '' replied Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 15]: `` Medea 's right , '' croaked Mrs Culpepper ; `` all moonshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 50]: `` So you need not be so very particular , papa , I can tell you , '' rejoined Miss Medea , who then whispered in her father 's ear , loud enough for me to hear , `` No such thing , nothing but a regular marine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 35]: `` Pooh , nonsense , '' replied the purser , in a low voice ; `` the boy has been taught to say it -- he 's too clever for you , Medea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 43]: At this very true remark of her father 's , Miss Medea swelled into a towering passion , her whole face , neck , and shoulders -- for she wore a low gown in the morning -- turning to a fiery scarlet .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 12]: I never saw such a fury as she appeared to be .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 26]: She rushed by me so roughly , that I was thrown back a couple of paces , and then she bounced out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 20]: `` Medea knows how to put that and that together , Mr Culpepper , '' croaked out Mrs Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 37]: `` Medea 's wise in her own conceit , and you 're a regular old fool , '' rejoined Mr Culpepper , with asperity ; `` one too knowing and the other not half knowing enough .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 17]: Master Keene , I hope you are hungry , for we have a very nice dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 9]: Do you like ducks and green peas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 22]: `` Yes , sir , very much , '' replied I. `` Were you born at Chatham , Master Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 15]: `` No , sir , I was born at the Hall , near Southampton .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 16]: My mother was brought up by old Mrs Delmar , the captain 's aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 24]: I gave this intelligence on purpose ; as I knew it would puzzle Miss Medea , who had just returned from the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 25]: Mr Culpepper nodded his head triumphantly to his daughter and wife , who both appeared dumb-founded at this new light thrown upon the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 25]: Miss Medea paused a moment and then said to me , -- `` I wish to ask you one question , Master Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 42]: `` I will not answer any more of your questions , miss , '' replied I ; `` You have been questioning me all the morning , and just now , you were so rude as nearly to push me down .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 46]: If you want to know anything more , ask Captain Delmar ; or , if you wish it , I will ask Captain Delmar whether I am to answer you , and if he says I am , I will , but not without . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 28]: This was a decided blow on my part ; mother and Medea both looked frightened , and Mr Culpepper was more alarmed than either of the females .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 68]: It proved to them that I knew what they were inquiring for , which was to them also proof that I also knew who I was ; and further , my reference to Captain Delmar satisfied them that I felt sure of his support , and they knew that he would be very much irritated if I told him on what score they had been pumping me .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 60]: `` You are very right , Master Keene , '' said Mr Culpepper , turning very red , `` to refuse to answer any questions you do n't like ; and , Medea , I 'm surprised at your behaviour ; I insist upon it you do not annoy Master Keene with any more of your impertinent curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 23]: `` No , no , '' croaked the old lady ; `` hold your tongue , Medea , hold your tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 27]: Miss Medea , who looked as if she could tear my eyes out if she dared , swallowed down her rage as well as she could .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 51]: She was mortified at finding she had made a mistake , annoyed at my answering her so boldly , and frightened at her father 's anger ; for the old gentleman was very apt to vent it in the _ argumentum ad feminam _ , and box her ears soundly .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 24]: Fortunately dinner was served just at this moment , and this gave a turn to the conversation , and also to their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 21]: Mr Culpepper was all attention , and Miss Medea , gradually recovering her temper , also became affable and condescending .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 44]: The evening passed away very agreeably ; but I went to bed early , as I wished to be left to my own reflections , and it was not till daylight that I could compose my troubled mind so as to fall asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 56]: Although the aversion which I had taken to the whole Culpepper family was so great , that I could have done anything to annoy them , my mind was now so fully occupied with the information which I had collected relative to my supposed birth and parentage , that I could not think of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 40]: I walked on the common or in the little garden during the whole of the following day , plunged in deep thought , and at night , when I went to bed , I remained awake till the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 23]: During these last two days I had thought and reflected more than I had perhaps done from the hour of my birth .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 87]: That I was better off than I should have been if I had been the son of a private in the marines , I felt convinced ; but still I had a feeling that I was in a position in which I might be subjected to much insult , and that , unless I was acknowledged by my aristocratic parent , my connection with his family would be of no use to me ; -- and Captain Delmar , how was I to behave to him ?
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 33]: I did not like him much , that was certain , nor did this new light which had burst forth make me feel any more love for him than I did before .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 25]: Still my mother 's words at Chatham rung in my ears , `` Do you know who it is that you have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 2]: etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 25]: I felt sure that he was my father , and I felt a sort of duty towards him ; perhaps an increase of respect .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 37]: These were anxious thoughts for a boy not fourteen ; and the Culpeppers remarked , that I had not only looked very pale , but had actually grown thin in the face during my short stay .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 99]: As I was very quiet and reserved after the first day , they were very glad when my clothes were brought home , and I was reported ready to embark ; so was I , for I wanted to go on board and see my friend Tommy Dott , with whom I intended , if the subject was brought up , to consult as to my proceedings , or perhaps I thought it would be better to consult Bob Cross , the captain 's coxswain ; I was not sure that I should not advise with them both .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 13]: I had made up my mind how to behave to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 84]: I knew that she would never acknowledge the truth , after what had passed between the captain and her when I was present ; but I was resolved that I would let her know that I was in the secret ; and I thought that the reply to me would be a guide as to the correctness of the fact , which , with all the hastiness of boyhood , I considered as incontrovertible , although I had not the least positive proof .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 72]: The day that I was to go on board , I requested Miss Culpepper to give me a sheet of paper , that I might write to my mother ; she supplied me very readily , saying , `` You had better let me see if you make any mistake in your spelling before the letter goes ; your mamma will be so pleased if you write your letter properly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 12]: She then went down into the kitchen to give some orders .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 76]: As I had not the slightest intention that she should read what I wrote , and resolved to have it in the post before she came up again , I was very concise in my epistle , which was as follows : -- `` Dear Mother : -- I have found it all out -- I am the son of Captain Delmar , and everyone here knows what you have kept a secret from me .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: I go on board to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 8]: `` Yours truly , P. KEENE . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: This was very short , and , it must be admitted , direct to the point .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 17]: I could not perhaps have written one which was so calculated to give my mother uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 20]: As soon as it was finished , I folded it up , and lighted a taper to seal it .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 26]: Old Mrs Culpepper , who was in the room , croaked out , `` No , no ; you must show it to Medea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 26]: But I paid no attention to her , and having sealed my letter , put on my hat , and walked out to the post-office .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 36]: I dropped it into the box , and , on returning , found Mr Culpepper coming home , accompanied by Bob Cross , the captain 's coxswain , and two of the boat 's crew .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 40]: As I presumed , they were sent for me ; I joined them immediately , and was kindly greeted by Bob Cross , who said : -- `` Well , Mr Keene , are you all ready for shipping ?
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 8]: We 've come for your traps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 27]: `` All ready , '' replied I , `` and very glad to go , for I 'm tired of staying on shore doing nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 34]: We were soon at the house ; the seamen carried away my chest and bedding , while Bob Cross remained a little while , that I might pay my farewell to the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 12]: The ceremony was not attended with much regret on either side .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 72]: Miss Culpepper could not help asking me why I did not show her my letter , and I replied , that there were secrets in it , which answer did not at all add to her good temper ; our adieus were , therefore , anything but affectionate , and before the men with my effects were a hundred yards in advance , Bob Cross and I were at their heels .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 31]: `` Well , Master Keene , '' said Bob , as we wended our way across South Sea Common , `` how do you like the purser 's ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 37]: `` Not at all , '' replied I ; `` they have done nothing but try to pump me the whole time I have been there ; but they did not make much of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 19]: `` Women will be curious , Master Keene -- pray what did they try to pump about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 11]: I hardly knew how to reply , and I hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 93]: I felt a strong inclination towards Bob Cross , and I had before reflected whether I should make him my confidant ; still , I was undecided and made no reply , when Bob Cross answered for me : -- `` Look ye , child -- for although you 're going on the quarter-deck , and I am before the mast , you are a child compared to me -- I can tell you what they tried to pump about , as well as you can tell me , if you choose .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 36]: According to my thinking , there 's no lad on board the frigate that will require good advice as you will ; and I tell you candidly , you will have your cards to play .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 79]: Bob Cross is no fool , and can see as far through a fog as most chaps ; I like you for yourself as far as I see of you , and I have not forgotten your mother 's kindness to me , when she had her own misery to occupy her thoughts ; not that I wanted the money -- it was n't the money , but the way and the circumstances under which it was given .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 55]: I told you I 'd look after you a bit -- a bit means a great deal with me -- and so I will , if you choose that I shall ; if not , I shall touch my hat to you , as my officer , which wo n't help you very much .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 24]: So , now you have to settle , my lad , whether you will have me as your friend , or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 6]: The appeal quite decided me .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 39]: `` Bob Cross , '' replied I. `` I do wish to make you my friend ; I thought of it before , but I did not know whether to go to you or to Tommy Dott . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 4]: `` Tommy Dott !
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 37]: Well , Master Keene , that 's not very flattering , to put me in one scale , and Tommy Dott in the other ; I 'm not surprised at its weighing down in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 66]: If you wish to get into mischief you ca n't apply to a better hand than Tommy Dott ; but Tommy Dott is not half so fit to advise you , as you are , I expect , to advise him ; so make him your playmate and companion , if you please , but as to his advice , it 's not worth asking .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 30]: However , as you have given me the preference , I will now tell you that the Culpepper people have been trying to find out who is your father .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: Ai n't I right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 93]: `` Yes , you are , '' replied I. `` Well , then , this is no time to talk about such things ; we shall be down to the boat in another minute , so we 'll say no more at present ; only recollect , when you are on board , if they talk about appointing a man to take charge of your hammock , say that Bob Cross , the captain 's coxswain , is , you understand , to be the person ; say that and no more .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 45]: I will tell you why by-and-by , when we have time to talk together and if any of your messmates say anything to you on the same point which the Culpeppers have been working at , make no reply and hold yourself very stiff .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 23]: Now , here we are at the sally port , so there 's an end to our palaver for the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 58]: My chest and bedding were already in the boat , and as soon as Cross and I had stepped in he ordered the bowman to shove off ; in half an hour we arrived alongside the frigate , which lay at Spithead , bright with new paint , and with her pennant proudly flying to the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 32]: `` You 'd better follow me , sir , and mind you touch your hat when the officers speak to you , '' said Bob Cross , ascending the accommodation ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 25]: I did so , and found myself on the quarter deck , in the presence of the first lieutenant and several of the officers .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 11]: `` Well , Cross , '' said the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 14]: `` I 've brought a young gentleman on board to join the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 14]: Captain Delmar has , I believe , given his orders about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 8]: `` Mr Keene , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 12]: said the first lieutenant , eyeing me from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I , touching my hat .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 10]: `` How long have you been at Portsmouth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 16]: `` Three days , sir ; I have been staying at Mr Culpepper 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 13]: `` Well , did you fall in love with Miss Culpepper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 15]: `` No , sir , '' replied I ; `` I hate her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 15]: At this answer the first lieutenant and the officers near him burst out a-laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 22]: `` Well , youngster , you must dine with us in the gun-room to-day ; and where 's Mr Dott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 19]: `` Here , sir , '' said Tommy Dott , coming from the other side of the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 19]: `` Mr Dott , take this young gentleman down below , and show him the midshipmen 's berth .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 14]: Let me see , who is to take care of his hammock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 26]: `` I believe that Bob Cross is to take care of it , sir , '' said I. `` The captain 's coxswain -- humph .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 26]: Well , that 's settled at all events ; very good -- we shall have the pleasure of your company to dinner , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 15]: Why , Mr Dott and you look as if you knew each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 8]: `` Do n't we , Tommy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: said I to the midshipman , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 58]: `` I suspect that there is a pair of you , '' said the first lieutenant , turning aft and walking away ; after which Tommy and I went down the companion ladder as fast as we could , and in a few seconds afterwards were sitting together on the same chest , in most intimate conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 59]: My extreme resemblance to our honourable captain was not unobserved by the officers who were on the quarter-deck at the time of my making my appearance ; and , as I afterwards heard from Bob Cross , he was sent for by the surgeon , on some pretence or another , to obtain any information relative to me .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 27]: What were Bob Cross 's reasons for answering as he did I could not at that time comprehend , but he explained them to me afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 9]: `` Who brought him down , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 6]: said the surgeon , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 18]: `` His own mother , sir ; he has no father , sir , I hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 6]: `` Did you see her ?
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 9]: What sort of a person was she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 57]: `` Well , sir , '' replied Bob Cross , `` I 've seen many ladies of quality , but such a real lady I do n't think I ever set my eyes upon before ; and such a beauty -- I 'd marry to-morrow if I could take in tow a craft like her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 10]: `` How did they come down to Portsmouth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 31]: `` Why , sir , she came down to Portsmouth in a coach and four ; but she walked to the George Hotel , as if she was nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 34]: This was not a fib on the part of the coxswain , for we came down by the Portsmouth coach ; it did , however , deceive the surgeon , as was intended .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 11]: `` Did you see anything of her , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 29]: `` Not when she was with the captain , sir , but at her own lodgings I did ; such a generous lady I never met with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 38]: A few more questions were put , all of which were replied to in much the same strain by the coxswain , so as to make out my mother to be a very important and mysterious personage .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 89]: It is true that Tommy Dott could have contradicted all this ; but , in the first place , it was not very likely that there would be any communication upon the point between him and the officers ; and in the next I cautioned him to say nothing about what he knew , which , as he was strongly attached to me , he strictly complied with : so Bob Cross completely mystified the surgeon , who , of course , made his report to his messmates .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 13]: Mr Culpepper 's report certainly differed somewhat from that of Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 84]: There was my statement of my aunt being married to a marine officer -- but it was my statement ; there was also my statement of my mother residing with Captain Delmar 's aunt ; altogether there was doubt and mystery ; and it ended in my mother being supposed to be a much greater person than she really was -- everything tending to prove her a lady of rank being willingly received , and all counter-statements looked upon as apocryphal and false .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 38]: But whoever my mother might be , on one point every one agreed , which was , that I was the son of the Honourable Captain Delmar , and on this point I was equally convinced myself .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 25]: I waited with some anxiety for my mother 's reply to my letter , which arrived two days after I had joined the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 69]: It was as follows : -- `` My dear Percival : -- `` You little know the pain and astonishment which I felt upon receipt of your very unkind and insulting letter ; surely you could not have reflected at the time you wrote it , but must have penned it in a moment of irritation arising from some ungenerous remark which has been made in your hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 37]: `` Alas , my dear child , you will find , now that you have commenced your career in life , that there are too many whose only pleasure is to inflict pain upon their fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 41]: I only can imagine that some remark has been made in your presence , arising from there being a similarity of features between you and the Honourable Captain Delmar ; that there is so has been before observed by others .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 62]: Indeed your uncle and aunt Bridgeman were both struck with the resemblance , when Captain Delmar arrived at Chatham ; but this proves nothing , my dear child -- people are very often alike , who have never seen each other , or heard each other mentioned , till they have by accident been thrown together so as to be compared .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 79]: `` It may certainly be , as your father was in the service of Captain Delmar , and constantly attended upon him , and indeed I may add as I was occasionally seeing him , that the impression of his countenance might be constantly in our memory , and -- but you do n't understand such questions , and therefore I will say no more , except that you will immediately dismiss from your thoughts any such idea .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 47]: `` You forget , my dearest boy , that you are insulting me by supposing any such thing , and that your mother 's honour is called in question ; I am sure you never thought of that when you wrote those hasty and inconsiderate lines .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 103]: I must add , my dear boy , that knowing Captain Delmar , and how proud and sensitive he is , if it should ever come to his knowledge that you had suspected or asserted what you have , his favour and protection would be lost to you for ever : at present he is doing a kind and charitable action in bringing forward the son of a faithful servant ; but if he imagined for a moment that you were considered related to him he would cast you off for ever , and all your prospects in life would be ruined .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 28]: `` Even allowing it possible that you were what you so madly stated yourself in your letter to be , I am convinced he would do so .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 27]: If such a report came to his ears , he would immediately disavow you , and leave you to find your own way in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 67]: `` You see , therefore , my dear boy , how injurious to you in every way such a ridiculous surmise must prove , and I trust that , not only for your own sake , but for your mother 's character , you will , so far from giving credence , indignantly disavow what must be a source of mischief and annoyance to all parties .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 37]: `` Captain Bridgeman desires me to say , that he is of my opinion , so is your aunt Milly : as for your grandmother , of course , I dare not show her your letter .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 30]: Write to me , my dear boy , and tell me how this unfortunate mistake happened , and believe me to be your affectionate mother , ARABELLA KEENE . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 64]: I read this letter over ten times before I came to any conclusion ; at last I said to myself , there is not in any one part of it any positive denial of the fact , and resolved some future day , when I had had some conversation with Bob Cross , to show it to him , and ask his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 47]: The next morning , at daylight , the blue Peter was hoisted at the foremast , and the gun fired as a signal for sailing ; all was bustle -- hoisting in , clearing boats of stock , and clearing the ship of women and strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 30]: At ten o'clock Captain Delmar made his appearance , the hands were piped up anchor , and in half an hour we were standing out for St. Helen 's .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 19]: Before night it blew very fresh , and we went rolling down the Channel before an easterly wind .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 36]: I went to my hammock very sick , and did not recover for several days , during which nobody asked for me , or any questions about me , except Bob Cross and Tommy Dott .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 53]: As soon as I was well enough , I made my appearance on deck , and was ordered by the first lieutenant to do my duty under the signal midshipman : this was day duty , and not very irksome ; I learnt the flags , and how to use a spy-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 39]: We were charged with despatches for the fleet , then off Cadiz , and on the tenth day we fell in with it , remained a week in company , and then were ordered to Gibraltar and Malta .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 15]: From Malta we went home again with despatches , having been out three months .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 30]: During this short and pleasant run , I certainly did not learn much of my profession , but I did learn a little of the ways of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 39]: First , as to Captain Delmar , his conduct to me was anything but satisfactory ; he never inquired for me during the time that I was unwell , and took no notice of me on my reappearance .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 100]: The officers and young gentlemen , as midshipmen are called , were asked to dine in the cabin in rotation , and I did in consequence dine two or three times in the cabin ; but it appeared to me , as if the captain purposely took no notice of me , although he generally did say a word or two to the others ; moreover as the signal mids were up in the morning watch , he would occasionally send to invite one of the others to breakfast with him , but he never paid me that compliment .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 22]: This annoyed me , and I spoke of it to Bob Cross , with whom I had had some long conversations .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 26]: I had told him all I knew relative to myself , what my suspicions were , and I had shown him my mother 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 49]: His opinion on the subject may be given in what follows : -- `` You see , Master Keene , you are in an awkward position ; the captain is a very proud man , and too proud to acknowledge that you are any way related to him .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 36]: It 's my opinion , from what you have told me , and from other reasons , particularly from your likeness to the captain , that your suspicions are correct ; but , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 25]: Your mother is sworn to secrecy -- that 's clear ; and the captain wo n't own you -- that 's also very clear .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 29]: I had some talk with the captain 's steward on the subject when I was taking a glass of grog with him the other night in this berth .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 57]: It was he that brought up the subject , not me , and he said , that the captain not asking you to breakfast , and avoiding you , as it were , was another proof that you belonged to him ; and the wishing to hide the secret only makes him behave as he does .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 36]: You have a difficult game to play , Master Keene ; but you are a clever lad , and you ask advice -- mind you follow it , or it 's little use asking it .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 27]: You must always be very respectful to Captain Delmar , and keep yourself at as great a distance from him as he does from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 21]: `` That I 'm sure I will , '' replied I , `` for I dislike him very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 66]: `` No , you must not do that , but you must bend to circumstances ; by-and-by things will go on better ; but mind you keep on good terms with the officers , and never be saucy , or they may say to you what may not be pleasant ; recollect this , and things will go on better , as I said before .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 30]: If Captain Delmar protects you with his interest , you will be a captain over the heads of many who are now your superiors on board of this frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 85]: One thing be careful of , which is , to keep your own counsel , and do n't be persuaded in a moment of confidence to trust anything to Tommy Dott , or any other midshipman ; and if any one hints at what you suppose , deny it immediately ; nay , if necessary , fight for it -- that will be the way to please the captain , for you will be of his side then , and not against him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 38]: That this advice of Bob Cross was the best that could be given to one in my position there could not be a doubt ; and that I did resolve to follow it , is most certain .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 40]: I generally passed away a portion of my leisure hours in Bob 's company , and became warmly attached to him ; and certainly my time was not thrown away , for I learnt a great deal from him .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 44]: One evening , as I was leaning against one of the guns on the main deck , waiting for Cross to come out of the cabin , I was amused with the following conversation between a boatswain 's mate and a fore-top man .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 6]: I shall give it verbatim .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 30]: They were talking of one that was dead ; and after the boatswain 's mate had said -- `` Well , he 's in heaven , poor fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 24]: After a pause , the fore-top man said -- `` I wonder , Bill , whether I shall ever go to heaven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 6]: replied the boatswain 's mate .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 36]: `` Why , the parson says it 's good works ; now , I certainly have been a pretty many times in action , and I have killed plenty of Frenchmen in my time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 21]: `` Well , that 's sufficient , I should think ; I hold my hopes upon just the same claims .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 26]: I 've cut down fifty Frenchmen in my life , and if that ai n't good works , I do n't know what is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 9]: `` I suppose Nelson 's in heaven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 46]: `` Of course ; if so be he wishes to be there , I should like to know who would keep him out , if he was determined on it ; no , no ; depend upon it he walked _ slap _ in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 32]: On our return to Portsmouth , the captain went up to the Admiralty with the despatches , the frigate remaining at Spithead , ready to sail at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 92]: I was now quite accustomed to the ship and officers ; the conviction I had of my peculiar position , together with the advice of Bob Cross , had very much subdued my spirit ; perhaps the respect created by discipline , and the example of others , which produced in me a degree of awe of the captain and the lieutenants , assisted a little -- certain it is , that I gained the goodwill of my messmates , and had not been in any scrape during the whole cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 33]: The first lieutenant was a stern , but not unkind man ; he would blow you up , as we termed it , when he scolded for half an hour without ceasing .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 31]: I never knew a man with such a flow of words ; but if permitted to go on without interruption , he was content , without proceeding to further punishment .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 32]: Any want of respect , however , was peculiarly offensive to him , and any attempt to excuse yourself was immediately cut short with , `` No reply , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 51]: The second day after our return to Spithead , I was sent on shore in the cutter to bring off a youngster who was to join the ship ; he had never been to sea before ; his name was Green , and he was as green as a gooseberry .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 25]: I took a dislike to him the moment that I saw him , because he had a hooked nose and very small ferrety eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 49]: As we were pulling on board he asked me a great many questions of all kinds , particularly about the captain and officers , and to amuse myself and the boat 's crew , who were on the full titter , I exercised my peculiar genius for invention .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 69]: At last , after I had given a character of the first lieutenant , which made him appear a sort of marine ogre , he asked how it was I got on with him : -- `` O , very well , '' replied I ; `` but I 'm a freemason , and so is he , and he 's never severe with a brother mason . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 12]: `` But how did he know you were a mason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 45]: `` I made the sign to him the very first time that he began to scold me , and he left off almost immediately ; that is , when I made the second sign ; he did not when I made the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: `` I should like to know these signs .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 9]: Wo n't you tell them to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: `` Tell them to you !
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 18]: oh no , that wo n't do , '' replied I. `` I do n't know you .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 16]: Here we are on board -- in bow , -- rowed of all , men .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 14]: Now , Mr Green , I 'll show you the way up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 102]: Mr Green was presented , and ushered into the service much in the same way as I was ; but he had not forgotten what I said to him relative to the first lieutenant ; and it so happened that , on the third day he witnessed a jobation , delivered by the first lieutenant to one of the midshipmen , who , venturing to reply , was ordered to the mast-head for the remainder of the day ; added to which , a few minutes afterwards , the first lieutenant ordered two men to be put both legs in irons .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 49]: Mr Green trembled as he saw the men led away by the master-at-arms , and he came to me : `` I do wish , Keene , you would tell me those signs , '' said he ; `` ca n't you be persuaded to part with them ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 15]: I 'll give you any thing that I have which you may like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 39]: `` Well , '' said I , `` I should like to have that long spy-glass of yours , for it 's a very good one ; and , as signal-midshipman , will be useful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 25]: `` I will give it you with all my heart , '' replied he , `` if you will tell me the signs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 23]: `` Well , then , come down below , give me the glass , and I will tell them to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 22]: Mr Green and I went down to the berth , and I received the spy-glass as a present in due form .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 86]: I then led him to my chest in the steerage , and in a low , confidential tone , told him as follows : -- `` You see , Green , you must be very particular about making those signs , for if you make a mistake , you will be worse off than if you never made them at all , for the first lieutenant will suppose that you are trying to persuade him that you are a mason , when you are not .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 69]: Now , observe , you must not attempt to make the first sign until he has scolded you well ; then , at any pause , you must make it ; thus , you see , you must put your thumb to the tip of your nose , and extend your hand straight out from it , with all the fingers separated , as wide as you can .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: Now , do it as I did it .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 11]: Stop -- wait a little , till that marine passes .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 6]: Yes , that is it .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 20]: Well , that is considered the first proof of your being a mason , but it requires a second .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 103]: The first lieutenant will , I tell you frankly , be or rather pretend to be , in a terrible rage , and will continue to rail at you ; you must , therefore , wait a little till he pauses ; and then , you observe , put up your thumb to your nose , with the fingers of your hands spread out as before , and then add to it your other hand , by joining your other thumb to the little finger of the hand already up , and stretch your other hand and fingers out like the first .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 11]: Then you will see the effects of the second sign .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 9]: Do you think you can recollect all this ?
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 14]: for , as I said before , you must make no mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 25]: Green put his hands up as I told him , and after three or four essays declared himself perfect , and I left him .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 48]: It was about three days afterwards that Mr Green upset a kid of dirty water upon the lower deck which had been dry holystoned , and the mate of the lower deck , when the first lieutenant went his round , reported the circumstance to exculpate himself .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 33]: Mr Green was consequently summoned on the quarter-deck ; and the first lieutenant , who was very angry , commenced , as usual , a volley of abuse on the unfortunate youngster .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 50]: Green , recollecting my instructions , waited till the first lieutenant had paused , and then made the first freemason sign , looking up very boldly at the first lieutenant , who actually drew back with astonishment at this contemptuous conduct , hitherto unwitnessed on board of a man-at-war .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 8]: sir , '' cried the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: `` Why , sir , are you mad ?
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 15]: -- you , just come into the service , treating me in this manner !
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 37]: I can tell you , sir , that you will not be three days longer in the service -- no , sir , not three days ; for either you leave the service or I do .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 32]: Of all the impudence , of all the insolence , of all the contempt I have heard of , this beats all -- and from such a little animal as you .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 31]: Consider yourself as under an arrest , sir , till the captain comes on board , and your conduct is reported ; go down below , sir , immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 67]: The lieutenant paused , and now Green gave him sign the second , as a reply , thinking that they would then come to a right understanding -- but to his astonishment , the first lieutenant was more curious than ever ; and calling the sergeant of marines , ordered him to take Mr Green down , and put him in irons , under the half-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 20]: Poor Green was handed down , all astonishment , at the want of success of his mason 's signs .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 51]: I , who stood abaft , was delighted at the success of my joke , while the first lieutenant walked hastily up and down the deck , as much astonished as enraged at such insulting and insolent conduct from a lad who had not been a week in the service .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 65]: After a time the first lieutenant went down below , when Bob Cross , who was on deck , and who had perceived my delight at the scene , which was to him and all others so inexplicable , came up to me and said : -- `` Master Keene , I 'm sure , by your looks , you knew something about this .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 19]: That foolish lad never had dared do so , if he knew what it was he had done .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 16]: Now , do n't look so demure , but tell me how it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 76]: I walked aft with Bob Cross , and confided my secret to him ; he laughed heartily , and said : -- `` Well , Tommy Dott did say that you were up to any thing , and so I think you are ; but you see this is a very serious affair for poor Green , and , like the fable of the frogs , what is sport to you is death to others .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 47]: The poor lad will be turned out of the service , and lose his chance of being a post captain ; so you must allow me to explain the matter so that it gets to the ears of the first lieutenant as soon as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 44]: `` Well , '' replied I , `` do as you like , Bob ; if any one 's to be turned out of the service for such nonsense , it ought to be me , and not Green , poor snob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 51]: `` No fear of your being turned out ; the first lieutenant wo n't like you the worse , and the other officers will like you better especially as I shall say that it is by your wish that I explain all to get Mr Green out of the scrape .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 36]: I 'll go to the surgeon and tell him -- but , Master Keene , do n't you call such matters _ nonsense _ , or you 'll find yourself mistaken one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 21]: I never saw such disrespect on a quarter-deck in all my life -- worse than mutiny a thousand times . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 37]: Here Bob Cross burst out into a fit of laughter , as he recalled Green 's extended fingers to his memory , and then he turned away and went down below to speak to the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 101]: As soon as Cross had quitted the deck , I could not restrain my curiosity as to the situation of my friend Green ; I therefore went down the ladder to the half-deck , and there , on the starboard side between the guns , I perceived the poor fellow , with his legs in irons , his hands firmly clasped together , looking so woeful and woe-begone , every now and then raising his eyes up to the beam of the upper deck , as if he would appeal to heaven , that I scarcely could refrain from laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 19]: I went up to him and said : -- `` Why , Green , how is all this ?
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 6]: -- what has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 4]: `` Happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 8]: said the poor fellow ; `` happened ?
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 10]: see what has happened ; here I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 10]: `` Did you make the freemason 's signs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 7]: replied I. `` Did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 14]: Yes -- I did : Oh , what will become of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 16]: `` You could not have made them right ; you must have forgotten them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 20]: `` I 'm sure I made them as you told me ; I 'm quite sure of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 31]: `` Then perhaps I did not recollect them exactly myself : however , be of good heart ; I will have the whole matter explained to the first lieutenant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 11]: `` Pray do ; only get me out of this .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 9]: I do n't want the glass back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 12]: `` I 'll have it done directly , '' replied I .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 23]: As I went away , Bob Cross came up , and said I was wanted by the first lieutenant in the gun-room .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 43]: `` Do n't be afraid , '' said he : `` they 've been laughing at it already , and the first lieutenant is it a capital humour ; still he 'll serve you out well ; you must expect that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 11]: `` Shall I make him the sign , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 5]: replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 24]: `` No , no ; you 've gone far enough , and too far already ; mind what I say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 23]: I went down into the gun-room , when a tittering ceased as the sentry opened the door , and I walked in .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: `` Did you want me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 16]: said I to the first lieutenant , touching my hat , and looking very demure .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 33]: `` So , Mr Keene , I understand it was you who have been practising upon Mr Green , and teaching him insult and disrespect to his superior officers on the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 5]: Well , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 10]: I made no reply , but appeared very penitent .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 51]: `` Because a boy has just come to sea , and is ignorant of his profession , it appears to be a custom -- which I shall take care shall not be followed up -- to play him all manner of tricks , and tell him all manner of falsehoods .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 13]: Now , sir , what have you to say for yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 45]: `` Mr Green and I have both just come to sea , sir , and the midshipmen all play us so many tricks , '' replied I , humbly , `` that I hardly know whether what I do is right or wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 17]: `` But , sir , it was you who played this trick to Mr Green . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 27]: `` Yes , sir , I told him so for fun , but I did n't think he was such a fool as to believe me .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 50]: I only said that you were a freemason , and that freemasons were kind to each other , and that you gave one another signs to know one another by ; I heard you say you were a freemason , sir , when I dined in the gun-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 24]: `` Well , sir , I did say so ; but that is no reason for your teaching him to be impudent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 35]: `` He asked me for the signs , sir , and I did n't know them exactly ; so I gave him the signs that Mr Dott and I always make between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 15]: `` Mr Dott and you -- a pretty pair , as I said before .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 30]: I 've a great mind to put you in Mr Green 's place -- at all events , I shall report your conduct when the captain comes from London .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: There , sir , you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 20]: I put on a penitent face as I went out wiping my eyes with the back of my hands .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 41]: After I went out , I waited a few seconds at the gun-room door , and then the officers , supposing that I was out of hearing , gave vent to their mirth , the first lieutenant laughing the loudest .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 41]: `` Cross is right , '' thought I , as I went up the ladder ; a minute afterwards , Mr Green was set free , and , after a severe reprimand , was allowed to return to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 41]: `` You are well out of that trick , my hearty , '' said Bob Cross ; `` the first lieutenant wo n't say a word to the captain , never fear ; but do n't try it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 18]: But an event occurred a few hours afterwards which might have been attended with more serious consequences .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 36]: The ship was , during the day , surrounded by shore boats of all descriptions , containing Jews , sailors ' wives , and many other parties , who wished to have admittance on board .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 29]: It was almost dusk , the tide was running strong flood , and the wind was very fresh , so that there was a good deal of sea .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 26]: All the boats had been ordered to keep off by the first lieutenant , but they still lingered , in hope of getting on board .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 102]: I was looking over the stern , and perceived that the boat belonging to the bumboat woman , who was on board of the ship , was lying with her painter fast to the stern ladder ; the waterman was in her , as well as one of the sailors ' wives , who had left her own wherry in hopes of getting on board when the waterman went alongside to take in the articles not sold , when the bumboat woman left the ship , which would be in a few minutes , as it was nearly gun-fire for sunset .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 29]: The waterman , who thought it time to haul alongside , and wished to communicate with his employer on board , was climbing up by the stern ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 16]: `` That 's against orders , you know , '' cried I to the man .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 73]: `` Yes , sir ; but it is so rough , that the boat would be swamped if it were to remain alongside long , and I hope you wo n't order me down again ; there 's some nice cakes in the boat , sir , just under the stern sheets , if you would like to have them , and think it worth while to go down for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 26]: This was a bribe , and I replied , `` No , I do n't want your cakes , but you may come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 17]: The man thanked me , and walked forward as soon as he had gained the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 44]: On second thoughts , I determined that I would have the cakes ; so I descended by the stern ladder , and desiring the woman who was left in the boat to haul upon the rope , contrived to get into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 11]: `` What is it you want , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 4]: said the woman .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 47]: `` I come for some of those cakes under the stern sheets , '' replied I. `` Well , I 'll soon rummage them out , '' said she , `` and I hope you will let me slip on board when the boat is alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 15]: Mind , sir , how you step , you 'll smash all the pipes .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 5]: Give me your hand .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 7]: I 'm an old sailor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 15]: `` I should not think so , '' replied I , looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 29]: I could hardly make out her face , but her form was small , and , if an old sailor , she certainly was a very young woman .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 94]: We had a good many articles to remove before we could get at the cakes , which were under the stern sheets ; and the boat rocked and tossed so violently with the sea which was running , that we were both on our knees for some little while before we obtained the basket : when we did , to our surprise , we found that the boat 's painter , somehow or another , had loosened , and that during our search we had drifted nearly one hundred yards from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 5]: `` Mercy on me !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 12]: -- why , we are adrift , '' exclaimed the woman .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 6]: `` What shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 23]: It 's no use hailing , they 'll never hear us ; look well round for any boat you may see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 23]: `` It is getting so dark that we shall not see far , '' replied I , not much liking our position .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 8]: `` Where shall we go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 4]: `` Go to !
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 36]: -- clean out to St. Helen 's , if the boat does not fill before we get there ; and further than that too , if I mistake not , with this gale of wind .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 16]: We may as well say our prayers , youngster , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 10]: `` Ca n't we make sail upon her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 13]: replied I. `` Ca n't we try and pull on shore somewhere ?
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 14]: Had we not better do that , and say our prayers afterwards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 70]: `` Well said , my little bantam , '' replied the woman : `` you would have made a good officer if you had been spared ; but the fact is , boy , that we can do nothing with the oars in this heavy sea ; and as for the sail , how can you and I step the mast , rolling and tossing about in this way ?
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 55]: If the mast were stepped , and the sail set , I think I could manage to steer , if the weather was smoother , but not in this bubble and this gale ; it requires older hands than either you or I. '' `` Well , then , what must we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 63]: `` Why , we must sit still and trust to our luck , bale out the boat , and keep her from swamping as long as we can , and between times we may cry , or we may pray , or we may eat the cakes and red herrings , or the soft bread and other articles in the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 49]: `` Let 's bale the boat out first , '' said I , `` for she 's half full of water ; then we 'll have something to eat , for I feel hungry and cold already , and then we may as well say our prayers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 34]: `` Well , and I tell you what , we 'll have something to drink , too , for I have a drop for Jem , if I could have got on board .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 33]: I promised it to him , poor fellow , but it 's no use keeping it now , for I expect we 'll both be in Davy 's locker before morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 75]: The woman took out from where it was secreted in her dress , a bladder containing spirits ; she opened the mouth of it , and poured out a portion into one of the milk-cans ; having drunk herself , she handed it to me , but not feeling inclined , and being averse to spirits , I rejected it , `` Not just now , '' said I , `` by-and-by perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 89]: During the time of this conversation we were swept by a strong tide and strong wind right out of the anchorage at Spithead ; the sea was very high , and dashed into the boat , so that I was continually baling to keep it free ; the night was as dark as pitch ; we could see nothing except the lights of the vessels which we had left far away from us , and they were now but as little twinkles as we rose upon the waves .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 14]: The wind roared , and there was every appearance of a heavy gale .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 30]: `` Little hopes of our weathering this storm , '' said the woman ; `` we shall soon be swamped if we do not put her before the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 12]: I 'll see if I can not find the lines . ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 40]: She did so after a time , and by means of a rudder put the boat before the wind ; the boat then took in much less water , but ran at a swift rate through the heavy sea .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 58]: `` There , we shall do better now ; out to sea we go , that 's clear , '' said the woman ; `` and before daylight we shall be in the Channel , if we do not fill and go down ; and then , the Lord have mercy upon us , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 8]: Wo n't you take a drop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 11]: continued she , pouring out some spirits into the can .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 13]: As I felt very cold , I did not this time refuse .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 33]: I drank a small quantity of the spirits ; the woman took off the remainder , which , with what she had previously drunk , began to have an effect upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 18]: `` That 's right , my little Trojan , '' said she , and she commenced singing .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 30]: `` A long pull , a strong pull , and a pull altogether ; in spite of wind and weather , boys , in spite of wind and weather .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 63]: Poor Jem , '' continued she , `` he 'll be disappointed ; he made sure of being glorious to-night , and I made sure to sleep by his side -- now he 'll be quite sober -- and I 'll be food for fishes ; it 's a cold bed that I shall turn into before morning , that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 27]: Hand me the cakes , boy , if you can fumble them out ; the more we fill ourselves , the less room for salt water .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 62]: Well , then , wind and waves are great bullies ; they fly slap back in a fright when they bang against a great ship ; but when they get hold of a little boat like this , how they leap and topple in , as if they made sure of us -LSB- here a wave dashed into the boat -RSB- .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 7]: Yes , that 's your sort .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 20]: Come along , swamp a little boat you washy cowards , it 's only a woman and a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 20]: Poor Jim , he 'll miss me something , but he 'll miss the liquor more ; who cares ?
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 7]: Let 's have another drop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 33]: `` Give me the lines , then , '' said I , as I perceived she was letting them go , `` or we shall be broadside to the waves again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 23]: I took the rudder lines from her , and steered the boat , while she again resorted to the bladder of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 24]: `` Take another sip , '' said she , after she had filled the milk-can ; `` it wo n't harm you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 44]: I thought the same , for I was wet through , and the wind , as it howled , pierced me to the bones ; I took a small quantity as before , and then continued to keep the boat before the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 24]: The sea was increasing very much and although no sailor , I felt fully convinced that the boat could not live much longer .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 11]: In the meantime the woman was becoming intoxicated very fast .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 44]: I knew the consequence of this , and requested her to bale out the boat : she did so , and sang a mournful sort of song as she baled , but the howling of the wind prevented me from distinguishing the words .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 28]: I can not well analyse my feelings at this time -- they were confused ; but this I know , self-preservation and hope were the most predominant .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 63]: I thought of my mother , of my aunt , of Captain Bridgeman , Captain Delmar , and Bob Cross ; but my thoughts were as rapid as the gale which bore us along , and I was too much employed in steering the boat , and preventing the seas from filling it , to have a moment to collect my ideas .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 19]: Again the woman applied to the bladder of spirits , and offered some to me ; I refused .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 41]: I had had enough , and by this time she had had too much , and after an attempt to bale she dropped down in the stern sheets , smashing pipes and everything beneath her , and spoke no more .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 82]: We had now been more than four hours adrift ; the wind was as strong as ever , and , I thought , the sea much higher ; but I kept the boat steady before the wind , and by degrees , as I became more accustomed to steer , she did not take in so much water ; still the boat appeared to be sinking deeper down , and after a time I considered it necessary to bale her out .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 38]: I did so with my hat , for I found it was half full of water ; and then I execrated the woman for having intoxicated herself , so as to be useless in such an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 43]: I succeeded in clearing the boat of the major portion of the water , which was no easy task , as the boat , having remained broadside to the wind , had taken in the sea continually as I baled it out .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 63]: I then once more resumed the helm , and put the boat before the wind , and thus did I continue for two hours more , when the rain came down in torrents , and the storm was wilder than ever , but a Portsmouth wherry is one of the best boats ever built , and so it proved in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 62]: Still I was now in a situation most trying for a lad between fourteen and fifteen ; my teeth chattered with the cold , and I was drenched through and through ; the darkness was opaque , and I could see nothing but the white foam of the waves , which curled and broke close to the gunwale of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 25]: At one moment I despaired , and looked for immediate death ; but my buoyant spirit raised me up again , and I hoped .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 12]: It would be daylight in a few hours , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 8]: how I looked and longed for daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 43]: I knew I must keep the boat before the wind ; I did so , but the seas were worse than ever ; they now continually broke into the boat , for the tide had turned , which had increased the swell .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 36]: Again I left the helm and bailed out ; I was cold and faint , and I felt recovered with the exertion ; I also tried to rouse the woman , but it was useless .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 20]: I felt for her bladder of liquor , and found it in her bosom , more than half empty .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 13]: I drank more freely , and my spirits and my courage revived .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 16]: After that , I ate , and steered the boat , awaiting the coming daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 20]: It came at last slowly -- so slowly ; but it did come , and I felt almost happy .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 37]: There is such a horror in darkness when added to danger ; I felt as if I could have worshipped the sun as it rose slowly , and with a watery appearance , above the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 83]: I looked around me : there was something like land astern of us , such as I had seen pointed out as land by Bob Cross , when off the coast of Portugal ; and so it was -- it was the Isle of Wight : for the wind had changed when the rain came down , and I had altered the course of the boat so that for the last four hours I had been steering for the coast of France .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 38]: But , although I was cold and shivering , and worn out with watching , and tired with holding the lines by which the wherry was steered , I felt almost happy at the return of day .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 98]: I looked down upon my companion in the boat ; she lay sound asleep , with her head upon the basket of tobacco pipes , her bonnet wet and dripping , with its faded ribbons hanging in the water which washed to and fro at the bottom of the boat , as it rolled and rocked to the motion of the waves ; her hair had fallen over her face , so as almost to conceal her features ; I thought that she had died during the night , so silent and so breathless did she lie .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 48]: The waves were not so rough now as they had been , for the flood tide had again made ; and as the beams of the morning sun glanced on the water , the same billows which appeared so dreadful in the darkness appeared to dance merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 25]: I felt hungry ; I took up a red herring from one of the baskets , and tore it to pieces with my teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 32]: I looked around me in every quarter to see if there was any vessel in sight , but there was nothing to be seen but now and then a screaming sea-gull .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 67]: I tried to rouse my companion by kicking her with my foot ; I did not succeed in waking her up , but she turned round on her back , and , her hair falling from her face , discovered the features of a young and pretty person , apparently not more than nineteen or twenty years old ; her figure was slight and well formed .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 87]: Young as I was , I thought it a pity that such a nice-looking person -- for she still was so , although in a state of disorder , and very dirty -- should be so debased by intoxication ; and as I looked at the bladder , still half full of spirits I seized it with an intention to throw it overboard , when I paused at the recollection that it had probably saved my life during the night , and might yet be required .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 48]: I did not like to alter the course of the boat , although I perceived that we were running fast from the land ; for although the sea had gone down considerably , there was still too much for the boat to be put broadside to it .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 28]: I can not say that I was unhappy ; I found my situation so very much improved to what it was during the darkness of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 11]: The sun shone bright , and I felt its warmth .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 15]: I had no idea of being lost -- death did not enter my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 15]: There was plenty to eat , and some vessel would certainly pick us up .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 14]: Nevertheless , I said my prayers , more devoutly than I usually did .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 31]: About noon , as near as I could guess , the tide changed again , and as the wind had lulled very much , there was little or no swell .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 57]: I thought that , now that the motion was not so great , we might possibly ship the foremast and make some little sail upon the boat ; and I tried again more earnestly to rouse up my companion ; after a few not very polite attempts , I succeeded in ascertaining that she was alive .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 25]: `` Be quiet , Jim , '' said she , with her eyes still closed ; `` it 's not five bells yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 14]: Another kick or two , and she turned herself round and stared wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 41]: `` Jim , '' said she , rubbing her eyes , and then she looked about her , and at once she appeared to remember what had passed ; she shrieked , and covered her face up with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 38]: `` I thought it was a dream , and was going to tell Jim all about it , at breakfast , '' said she , sorrowfully , `` but it 's all true -- true as gospel .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 6]: What will become of me ?
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 9]: We are lost , lost , lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 48]: `` We are not lost , but we should have been lost this night if I had been as drunk as you have been , '' replied I ; `` I 've had work enough to keep the boat above water , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 22]: `` That 's truth , '' replied she , rising up and taking a seat upon the thwart of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 35]: `` God , forgive me , poor wretch that I am : what will Jim think , and what will he say , when he sees my best bonnet in such a pickle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 24]: `` Are you quite sure that you 'll ever see Jim again , or that you 'll ever want your best bonnet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 7]: replied I. `` That 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 26]: If one 's body is to be tossed about by green waves , it 's little matter whether there 's a bonnet or shawl on .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 9]: Where are we , do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 17]: `` I can just see the land out there , '' replied I , pointing astern .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 21]: `` The sea is smooth ; I think we could ship the foremast , and get sail upon her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 9]: The young woman stood up in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' said she , `` I 'm pretty steady ; I think we could .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 19]: Last night in the dark and the tossing sea I could do nothing , but now I can .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 18]: What a blessing is daylight to cowards like me -- I am only afraid in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 15]: We must put some sail upon the boat , or nobody will see us .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 11]: What did you do with the bladder of liquor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 16]: `` Threw it overboard , '' replied I. `` Had you courage to do that ?
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 12]: -- and watching through the the night so wet and cold .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 12]: Well you did right -- I could not have done it .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 25]: that liquor -- that liquor ; I wish there was n't such a thing in the world , but it 's too late now .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 38]: When I first married James Pearson , and the garland was hung to the main-stay of the frigate , nobody could persuade me to touch it , not even James himself , whom I loved so much .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 26]: Instead of quarrelling with me for not drinking it , as he used to do , he now quarrels with me for drinking the most .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 20]: If you 'll come forward , sir , and help me , we 'll soon get up the foremast .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 14]: This is it , you see , with the jib passed round it .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 51]: Jim often says that I 'd make a capital sailor , if I 'd only enter in man 's clothes -- but as I tell him , I should be put up at the gangway , for not being sober , before I 'd been on board a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 14]: We contrived to ship the mast , and set the jib and foresail .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 39]: As soon as the sheets were hauled aft , my companion took the steering lines , saying , `` I know how to manage her well enough , now it 's daylight , and I 'm quite sober .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 77]: You must be very tired , sir ; so sit down on the thwart , or lie down if you please , and take a nap ; all 's safe enough now -- see , we lie up well for the land ; '' and such was the case , for she had brought the boat to the wind , and we skimmed over the waves at the rate of three or four miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 26]: I had no inclination to sleep ; I baled the boat out thoroughly , and put the baskets and boxes into some kind of order .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 29]: I then sat down on the thwarts , first looking round for a vessel in sight ; but seeing none , I entered into conversation with my companion .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 35]: said I. `` Peggy Pearson ; I have my marriage lines to show : they can throw nothing in my face , except that I 'm fond of liquor , God forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 29]: `` And what makes you so fond of it now , since you say that , when you were married , you did not care for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 15]: `` You may well say that : it all came of _ sipping _ .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 119]: James would have me on his knee , and would insist on my taking a sip ; and to please him I did , although it made me almost sick at first , and then after a while I did not mind it ; and then , you see , when I was waiting at the sallyport with the other women , the wind blowing fresh , and the spray wetting us as we stood on the shingle with our arms wrapped up in our aprons , looking out for a boat from the ship to come on shore , they would have a quartern , and make me take a drop ; and so it went on .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 50]: Then James made me bring him liquor on board , and I drank some with him ; but what finished me was , that I heard something about James when he was at Plymouth , which made me jealous , and then for the first time I got tipsy .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 31]: After that , it was all over with me ; but , as I said before , it began with sipping -- worse luck , but it 's done now .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 9]: Tell me what has passed during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 8]: Has the weather been very bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 18]: I told her what had occurred , and how I had kicked her to wake her up .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 51]: `` Well , I deserved more than kicking , and you 're a fine , brave fellow ; and if we get on board the Calliope again -- and I trust to God we shall -- I 'll take care to blow the trumpet for you as you deserve . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 42]: `` I do n't want any one to blow the trumpet for me , '' replied I. `` Do n't you be proud ; a good word from me may be of use to you and it 's what you deserve .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 15]: The ship 's company will think highly of you , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 45]: A good name is of no small value -- a captain has found out that before now ; you 're only a lad , but you 're a regular trump , and the seamen shall all know it , and the officers too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 27]: `` We must get on board the ship first , '' replied I , `` and we are a long way from it just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: `` We 're all right , and I have no fear .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 32]: If we do n't see a vessel we shall fetch the land somewhere before to-morrow morning , and it do n't look as if there would be any more bad weather .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 14]: I wonder if they have sent anything out to look after us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 16]: said I , pointing astern , `` it 's a sail of some kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 37]: `` Yes , '' said Peggy , `` so it is ; it 's a square-rigged vessel coming up the Channel -- we had better get on the other tack , and steer for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 57]: We wore the boat round and ran in the direction of the vessel ; in three hours we were close to her ; I hailed her as she came down upon us but no one appeared to hear us or see us , for she had lower studding-sails set , and there was no one forward .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 89]: We hailed again , and the vessel was now within twenty yards , and we were right across her bows ; a man came forward , and cried out , `` Starboard your helm , '' but not in sufficient time to prevent the vessel from striking the wherry , and to stave her quarter in ; we dropped alongside as the wherry filled with water , and we were hauled in by the seamen over the gunwale , just as she turned over and floated away astern .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 21]: `` Touch and go , my lad , '' said one of the seamen who had hauled me on board .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 12]: `` Why do n't you keep a better look out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 16]: said Peggy Pearson , shaking her petticoats , which were wet up to the knees .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 17]: `` Paint eyes in the bows of your brig , if you have n't any yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 42]: Now you 've lost a boatful of red-herrings , eggs , and soft tommy -- no bad things after a long cruise ; we meant to have paid our passage with them -- now you must take us for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 22]: The master of the vessel , who was on deck , observed that I was in the uniform of an officer .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 14]: He asked me how it was we were found in such a situation ?
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 9]: I narrated what had passed in few words .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 47]: He said that he was from Cadiz bound to London , and that he would put us on shore at any place up the river I would like , but that he could not lose the chance of the fair wind to land me anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 54]: I was too thankful to be landed anywhere ; and telling him that I should be very glad if he could put me on shore at Sheerness , which was the nearest place to Chatham , I asked leave to turn into one of the cabin bed-places , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 57]: I may as well here observe , that I had been seen by the sentry abaft to go down by the stern ladder into the boat , and when the waterman came back shortly afterwards to haul his boat up , and perceived that it had gone adrift , there was much alarm on my account .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 41]: It was too dark to send a boat after us that night , but the next morning the case was reported to the admiral of the port , who directed a cutter to get under weigh and look for us .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 45]: The cutter had kept close in shore for the first day , and it was on the morning after I was picked up by the brig , that , in standing more out , she had fallen in with the wherry , bottom up .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 33]: This satisfied them that we had perished in the rough night , and it was so reported to the port-admiral and to Captain Delmar , who had just come down from London .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 23]: I slept soundly till the next morning , when I found that the wind had fallen and that it was nearly calm .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 31]: Peggy Pearson was on deck ; she had washed herself and smoothed out with an iron the ribbons of her bonnet , and was really a very handsome young woman .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 31]: `` Mr Keene , '' said she , `` I did n't know your name before you told it to the skipper here ; you 're in a pretty scrape .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 24]: I do n't know what Jim Pearson will say when you go back , running away with his wife as you have done .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 17]: Do n't you think I had better go back first , and smooth things over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 21]: you laugh now , '' replied I ; `` but you did n't laugh the night we went adrift . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 8]: `` Because it was no laughing matter .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 27]: I owe my life to you , and if I had been adrift by myself , I should never have put my foot on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 49]: Do you know , '' said she to me , very solemnly , `` I 've made a vow -- yes , a vow to Heaven , that I 'll leave off drinking ; and I only hope I may have strength given me to keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 7]: `` Can you keep it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 32]: said I. `` I think I can ; for when I reflect that I might have gone to my account in that state , I really feel a horror of liquor .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 14]: If James would only give it up , I 'm sure I could .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 17]: I swear that I never will bring him any more on board -- that 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 63]: He may scold me , he may beat me -LRB- I do n't think he would do that , for he never has yet -RRB- ; but let him do what he pleases , I never will ; and if he keeps sober because he has n't the means of getting tipsy , I am sure that I shall keep my vow .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 39]: You do n't know how I hate myself ; and although I 'm merry , it 's only to prevent my sitting down and crying like a child at my folly and wickedness in yielding to temptation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 10]: `` I little thought to hear this from you .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 18]: When I was with you in the boat , I thought you a very different person . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 14]: `` A woman who drinks , Mr Keene , is lost to everything .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: I 've often thought of it , after I 've become sober again .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 12]: Five years ago I was the best girl in the school .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 12]: I was the monitor and wore a medal for good conduct .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 21]: I thought that I should be so happy with James ; I loved him so , and do so still .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 20]: I knew that he was fond of liquor , but I never thought that he would make me drink .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 28]: I thought then that I should cure him , and with the help of God I will now ; not only him , but myself too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 61]: And I will here state that Peggy Pearson , whose only fault was the passion she had imbibed for drinking , did keep her vow ; the difficulty of which few can understand who have not been intemperate themselves ; and she not only continued sober herself , but by degrees broke her husband of his similar propensity to liquor .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 16]: It was not till the evening of the fourth that we arrived at the Nore .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 34]: I had four pounds in my pocket at the time that I went adrift , which was more than sufficient , even if I had not intended to go and see my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 33]: A wherry came alongside , and Peggy Pearson and I stepped into it , after I had thanked the captain , and given a sovereign to the seamen to drink my health .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 39]: As soon as we landed at Sheerness I gave another of my sovereigns to Peggy , and left her to find her way back to Portsmouth , while I walked up to Chatham to my mother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 37]: It was past eight o'clock and quite dark when I arrived ; the shop was closed , and the shutters up at the front door ; so I went round to the back to obtain admittance .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 18]: The door was not fast , and I walked into the little parlour without meeting with anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 28]: I heard somebody upstairs , and I thought I heard sobbing ; it then struck me that my supposed loss might have been communicated to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 20]: There was a light on the parlour table , and I perceived an open letter lying near to it .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 13]: I looked at it ; it was the handwriting of Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 58]: The candle required snuffing ; I raised the letter to the light that I might read it , and read as follows : -- `` MY DEAR ARABELLA : -- `` You must prepare yourself for very melancholy tidings , and it is most painful to me to be compelled to be the party who communicates them .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 15]: A dreadful accident has occurred , and indeed I feel most sincerely for you .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 41]: On the night of the 10th , Percival was in a boat which broke adrift from the ship in a gale of wind ; it was dark , and the fact not known until too late to render any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 42]: `` The next day a cutter was despatched by the admiral to look for the boat , which must have been driven out to sea ; there was a woman in the boat as well as _ our _ poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 27]: I regret to say that the boat was found bottom up , and there is no doubt but that _ our _ dear child has perished .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 67]: `` You will believe me when I say that I deeply lament his loss ; not only on your account , but because I had become most partial to him for his many good qualities , and often have I regretted that his peculiar position prevented me from showing him openly that regard which , as _ his father _ , I really felt for him .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 55]: `` I know that I can say nothing that will alleviate your sufferings , and yet I fain would , for you have been so true , and anxious to please me in every point since our first acquaintance and intimacy , that there is nothing that you do not deserve at my hands .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 33]: `` Comfort yourself , dear Arabella , as well as you can with the reflection that it has been the will of Heaven , to whose decrees we must submit with resignation .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 32]: I am deeply suffering myself ; for , had he lived , I swear to you that I intended to do much more for him than ever I had promised you .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 43]: He would have made a good and gallant sailor had it pleased Heaven to spare him , and you would have been proud of him ; but it has been decided otherwise , and we must bow in obedience to His will .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 29]: God bless you , and support you in your afflictions , and believe me still , `` Yours , most sincerely and faithfully , `` PERCIVAL DELMAR . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 21]: `` Then it is so , '' thought I ; `` here I have it under his own hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 14]: I immediately folded up the letter , and put it into my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 31]: `` You and I never part , that is certain , '' murmured I. I had almost lost my breath from emotion , and I sat down to recover myself .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 16]: After a minute or two I pulled the letter out and read it over again .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 35]: `` And he is my father , and he loves me , but dare not show it , and he intended to do more for me than even he had promised my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 17]: I folded up the letter , kissed it fervently , and replaced it in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 13]: `` Now , '' thought I , `` what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 35]: This letter will be required of me by my mother , but never shall she get it ; not tears , nor threats , nor entreaties shall ever induce me to part with it .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 13]: Nobody has seen me -- nobody knows that I have been here .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 19]: I will go directly and join my ship ; yes , that will be my best plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 33]: I was so occupied with my own reverie , that I did not perceive a footstep on the stairs , until the party was so far down that I could not retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 6]: I thought to hide myself .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 13]: I knew by the list shoes that it must be my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 5]: A moment of reflection .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 44]: I blew out the light on the table , and put myself in an attitude : one arm raised aloft , the other extended from my body , and with my mouth wide open and my eyes fixed , I awaited her approach .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 56]: She came in -- saw me -- uttered a fearful shriek , and fell senseless on the floor ; the candle in her hand was extinguished in the fall : I stepped over her body ; and darting out into the back-yard , gained the door , and was in the street in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 16]: I was soon in the high road , and clear of the town of Chatham .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 45]: As my object was that it should not be supposed that I had been there , I made all the haste I could to increase my distance ; I therefore walked on in the direction of Gravesend , where I arrived about ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 24]: A return chaise offered to take me to Greenwich for a few shillings , and before morning dawned I had gained the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 31]: I lost no time in inquiring when the coaches started for Portsmouth , and found that I was in plenty of time , as one set off at nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 26]: Much as I wished to see London , my curiosity gave way to what I considered the necessity of my immediate return to the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 31]: At seven o'clock in the evening I arrived at Portsmouth ; I hastened down , jumped into a wherry , and was on board of the frigate again by eight .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 15]: It may be imagined that my sudden and unexpected appearance caused no little surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 55]: Indeed , the first lieutenant considered it right to send the gig on shore at that late hour to apprise the captain of my return , and Bob Cross had just time to give me a wring of the hand before he jumped into the boat , and went away to make the report .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 37]: I gave a history of my adventures to the officers , leaving them , however , to suppose that I had never been to Chatham , but had gone up to London in the merchant vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 47]: Pearson , the boatswain 's mate , came to make inquiries about his wife ; and , soon after , Bob Cross came on board with the captain 's orders , that I should go on shore to him in the gig on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 15]: I wished very much to consult Bob Cross previous to my seeing the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 40]: I told him so , and he agreed to meet me on the gangway about ten o'clock , as by that time the officers would be almost all in bed , and there would be less chance of interruption .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 47]: It was a fine , clear night , and as soon as we found ourselves alone I narrated to him , in a low voice , all that had taken place , and gave him the contents of the letter which I had taken possession of .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 25]: I then asked him what he thought I ought to do , now that I was certain of being the son of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 40]: `` Why , Master Keene , you have done it very cleverly , that 's the truth ; and that letter , which is as good as a certificate from Captain Delmar , must be taken great care of .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 60]: I hardly know where it ought to be put , but I think the best thing will be for me to sew it in a seal-skin pouch that I have , and then you can wear it round your neck , and next your skin ; for , as you say , you and that must never part company .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 14]: But , Master Keene , you must be silent as death about it .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 18]: You have told me , and I hope I may be trusted , but trust nobody else .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 54]: As to saying or hinting anything to the captain , you must n't think of it ; you must go on as before , as if you knew nothing , for if he thought you had the letter in your possession he would forget you were his son , and perhaps hate you .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 42]: He never would have been induced to acknowledge you under his own hand as his son had he not thought that you were dead and gone , as everybody else did ; so behave just as respectful and distant as before .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 26]: It 's only in some great emergency that that letter will do you any good , and you must reserve it in case of need .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 13]: If your mother is suspicious , why , you must blind her .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 49]: Your granny will swear that it was your ghost ; your mother may think otherwise , but can not prove it ; she dare not tell the captain that she suspects you have the letter , and it will all blow over after a cruise or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 24]: I agreed to follow the advice of Bob Cross , as I saw it was good , and we parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 31]: The next morning I went on shore to the captain , who received me , very stiffly , with , `` Mr Keene , you have had a narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 7]: How did you get back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 23]: I replied , that the vessel which picked me up was bound to London and that I had taken the coach down .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 30]: `` Well , I never had an idea that we should have seen you again and I have written to your mother , acquainting her with your loss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 7]: `` Have you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 12]: replied I ; `` it will make her very unhappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 24]: `` Of course it will ; but I shall write by this post , stating that you have been so fortunately preserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 19]: `` Thanky , sir , '' replied I ; `` have you any further orders , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 18]: `` No , Mr Keene ; you may go on board and return to your duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 22]: I made my bow , and quitted the room ; went down below , and found Bob Cross waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 8]: said he , as we walked away .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 24]: `` Stiff as ever , '' replied I : `` told me to go on board and ` tend to my duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 29]: `` Well , I knew it would be so , '' replied Bob ; `` it 's hard to say what stuff them great nobs are made of .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 20]: Never mind that ; you 've your own game to play , and your own secret to keep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 24]: `` His secret , '' replied I , biting my lips , `` to keep or to tell , as may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 40]: `` Do n't let your vexation get the better of you , Master Keene ; you 've the best of it , if you only keep your temper ; let him play his cards , and you play yours .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 31]: As you know his cards and he do n't know yours , you must win the game in the end -- that is , if you are commonly prudent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 23]: `` You are right , Cross , '' replied I ; `` but you forget that I am but a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 22]: `` You are but a boy , Master Keene , but you 've no fool 's head on your shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 19]: `` I hope not , '' replied I ; `` but here we are at the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 14]: `` Yes ; and , as I live , here 's Peggy Pearson .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 15]: Well , Peggy , how did you like your cruise with Master Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 16]: `` If I ever go on another , I hope he will be my companion .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 19]: Master Keene , will you allow me to go on board with you to see my husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 48]: `` Oh , yes , Peggy , '' replied Cross ; `` the first lieutenant would not refuse you after what has happened , nor Captain Delmar either , stiff as he is : for , although he never shows it , he do n't want feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 27]: Jim will be glad to see you , Peggy ; you have n't an idea how he took on , when he heard of your loss .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 11]: He borrowed a pocket-handkerchief from the corporal of marines . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 19]: `` I suspect he 'd rather borrow a bottle of rum from the purser , '' replied Peggy .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 14]: `` Recollect , Peggy , '' said I , holding up my finger .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 36]: `` Mr Keene , I do recollect ; I pledge you my word that I have not tasted a drop of spirits since we parted -- and that with a sovereign in my pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 13]: `` Well , only keep to it -- that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 26]: `` I will , indeed , Mr Keene ; and , what 's more , I shall love you as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 19]: We pulled on board in the gig , and Peggy was soon in the arms of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 45]: As Pearson embraced her at the gangway -- for he could not help it -- the first lieutenant very kindly said , `` Pearson , I sha n't want you on deck till after dinner : you may go below with your wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 23]: `` Now , may God bless you , for a cross-looking , kind-hearted gentleman , '' said Peggy to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 93]: Peggy was as good as her word to me ; she gave such an account of my courage and presence of mind , of her fears and at last of her getting tipsy -- of my remaining at the helm and managing the boat all night by myself , that I obtained great reputation among the ship 's company , and it was all reported to the officers , and worked its way until it came from the first lieutenant to the captain , and from the captain to the port admiral .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 40]: This is certain , that Peggy Pearson did do me a good service , for I was no longer looked upon as a mere youngster , who had just come to sea , and who had not been tried .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 36]: `` Well , sir , '' said Bob Cross , a day or two afterwards , `` it seems , by Peggy Pearson 's report , that you 're not frightened at a trifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: `` Peg Pearson 's report wo n't do me much good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 28]: `` You ought to know better , Master Keene , than to say that ; a mouse may help a lion , as the fable says . ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 12]: `` Where did you learn all your fables , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 37]: `` I 'll tell you ; there 's a nice little girl that used to sit on my knee and read her fables to me , and I listened to her because I loved her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 9]: `` And does she do so now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 29]: `` Oh , no ; she 's too big for that -- she 'd blush up to the temples ; but never mind the girl or the fables .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 17]: I told you that Peggy had reported your conduct , as we say in the service .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 62]: Now do you know , that this very day I heard the first lieutenant speaking of it to the captain , and you 've no idea how proud the captain looked , although he pretended to care nothing about it ; I watched him , and he looked as much as to say , ` that 's my boy . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 63]: `` Well , if that pleases him , I 'll make him prouder yet of me , if I have the opportunity , '' replied I. `` That you will , Master Keene , if I 'm any judge of fizonomy ; and that 's the way to go to a parent 's heart : make him feel proud of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 13]: I did not forget this , as the reader will eventually discover .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 28]: I had written to my mother , giving her a long account of my adventures , but not saying a word of my having been at Chatham .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 20]: I made her suppose , as I did the captain , that I had been carried up to London .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 20]: My letter reached her the day after the one announcing my safety , written to her by Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 29]: She answered me by return of post , thanking Heaven for my preservation , and stating how great had been her anguish and misery at my supposed loss .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 63]: In the latter part of the letter was this paragraph : -- `` Strange to say , on the night of the 16th , when I was on my bed in tears , having but just received the news of your loss , your grandmother went downstairs , and declares that she saw you or your ghost in the little back parlour .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 20]: At all events , I found her insensible on the floor , so that she must have seen something .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 35]: She might have been frightened at nothing ; and yet I know not what to think , for there are circumstances which almost make _ me _ believe that somebody was in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: I presume you can prove an _ alibi _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 23]: That my mother had been suspicious , perhaps more than suspicious , from the disappearance of the letter , I was convinced .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 35]: When I replied to her , I said : -- `` My _ alibi _ is easily proved by applying to the master and seamen of the vessel on board of which I was .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 54]: Old granny must have been frightened at her own shadow : the idea of my coming to your house , and having left it without seeing you is rather too absurd ; granny must have invented the story , because she hates me , and thought to make you do the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 15]: Whatever my mother may have thought , she did not again mention the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 37]: I had , however , a few days afterwards , a letter from my aunt Milly , in which she laughingly told the same story of granny swearing that she had seen me or my ghost .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 41]: `` At first we thought it was your ghost , but since a letter from Captain Delmar to your mother has been missing , it is now imagined that you have been here , and have taken possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 38]: You will tell me , my dearest Percival , I 'm sure , if you did play this trick to granny , or not ; you know you may trust me with any of your tricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 14]: But I was not in this instance to be wheedled by my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 41]: I wrote in return , saying how much I was amazed at my grandmother telling such fibs , and proved to her most satisfactorily that I was in London at the time they supposed I might have been at Chatham .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 128]: That my aunt had been requested by my mother to try to find out the truth , I was well convinced : but I felt my secret of too much importance to trust either of them and from that time the subject was never mentioned ; and I believe it was at last surmised that the letter might have been destroyed accidentally or purposely by the maid-servant , and that my grandmother had been frightened at nothing at all -- an opinion more supported , as the maid , who had taken advantage of my mother 's retiring to her room , and had been out gossiping , declared that she had not left the premises three minutes , and not a soul could have come in .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 19]: Moreover , it was so unlikely that I could have been in Chatham without being recognised by somebody .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 36]: My grandmother shook her head , and said nothing during all this canvassing of the question ; but my aunt Milly declared that I never would have been at Chatham without coming to see her .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 51]: And it was her opinion that the servant girl had read the letter when left on the table , and had taken it out to show to her associates ; and somebody who wished to have a hold upon my mother by the possession of the letter had retained it .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 22]: I think my mother came to that opinion at last , and it was the source of much uneasiness to her .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 32]: She dared not say a word to Captain Delmar , and every day expected to have an offer made of returning the letter , upon a certain sum being paid down .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 61]: But the offer was never made , as the letter had been sewed up by Bob Cross in the piece of seal-skin , and was worn round my neck with a ribbon , with as much care as if it had been a supposed bit of the wood of the true cross , possessed by some old female Catholic devotee .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 29]: But long before all these discussions were over , H.M. ship Calliope had been ordered to sail , and was steering down the Channel before a smart breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 51]: Although I have so much to say as to oblige me to pass over without notice the majority of my companions , I think I ought to dedicate one chapter to a more particular description of those with whom I was now principally in contact on board of the Calliope .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 19]: I have already spoken much of the Honourable Captain Delmar , but I must describe him more particularly .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 72]: When young , he must have been a very handsome man ; even now , although nearly fifty years of age , and his hair and whiskers a little mixed with grey , he was a fine-looking personage , of florid complexion , large blue eyes , nose and mouth very perfect : in height he was full six feet ; and he walked so erect that he looked even taller .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 14]: There was precision , I may say dignity , in all his motions .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 21]: If he turned to you , it was slowly and deliberately ; there was nothing like rapidity in his movement .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 39]: On the most trifling occasions , he wrapped himself up in etiquette with all the consequence of a Spanish Hidalgo ; and showed in almost every action and every word that he never forgot his superiority of birth .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 54]: No one , except myself , perhaps , would ever have thought of taking a liberty with him ; for although there was a pomposity about him , at the same time it was the pomposity of a high-bred gentleman , who respected himself , and expected every one to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 24]: That sometimes a little mirth was occasioned by his extreme precision is true ; but it was whispered , not boldly indulged in .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 23]: As to his qualities as an officer and seaman , I shall only say , that they were considered more than respectable .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 53]: Long habit of command had given him a fair knowledge of the duties in the first instance , and he never condescended -LRB- indeed , it would have been contrary to his character -RRB- to let the officers or seamen know whether he did or did not know anything about the second .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 20]: As to his moral character , I can only say , that it was very difficult to ascertain it .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 42]: That he would never do that which was in the slightest degree derogatory to the character of a gentleman was most certain : but he was so wrapped up in exclusiveness , that it was almost impossible to estimate his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 33]: Occasionally , I may say very rarely , he might express them ; but if he did , it was but for a moment , and he was again reserved as before .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 12]: That he was selfish is true ; but who is not ?
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 29]: and those in high rank are still more so than others , not so much by nature , but because their self is encouraged by those around them .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 17]: You could easily offend his pride but he was above being flattered in a gross way .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 22]: I really believe that the person in the ship for whom he had the least respect was the obsequious Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: Such was the Honourable Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 14]: Mr Hippesley , the first lieutenant , was a broad-shouldered , ungainly-looking personage .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 16]: He had more the appearance of a master in the service than a first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 19]: He was a thorough seaman ; and really , for a first lieutenant , a very good-natured man .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 36]: All that was requisite , was to allow his momentary anger to have free escape by the safety-valve of his mouth : if you did not , an explosion was sure to be the result .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 44]: He was , as we use the term at sea , a regular ship husband -- that is to say , he seldom put his foot on shore ; and if he did , he always appeared anxious to get on board again .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 21]: He was on good terms , but not familiar , with his messmates , and very respectful to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 44]: There was no other officer in the service who would have suited Captain Delmar so well as Mr Hippesley , who , although he might occasionally grumble at not being promoted , appeared on the whole to be very indifferent about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 24]: The men were partial to him , as they always are to one who , whatever may be his peculiarities , is consistent .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 29]: Nothing is more unpleasant to men than to sail under a person whom , to use their own expression , `` they never knew where to find . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 49]: The second and third lieutenants , Mr Percival and Mr Weymss , were young men of good family , and were admitted to a very slight degree of familiarity with Captain Delmar : they were of gentlemanly manners , both good seamen , and kind to their inferiors .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 21]: Mr Culpepper , the purser , was my abomination -- a nasty , earwigging , flattering , bowing old rogue .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 29]: The master , Mr Smith , was a very quiet man , plain and unoffending , but perfectly master of , and always attentive to , his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 16]: The marine officer , Mr Tusk , was a nonentity put into a red jacket .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 31]: The surgeon was a tall , and very finicking sort of gentleman as to dress ; but well informed , friendly in disposition , and perfectly acquainted with his profession .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 40]: My messmates were most of them young men of good birth , with the exception of Tommy Dott , who was the son of a warrant officer , and Mr Green , whose father was a boot-maker in London .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 20]: I shall not , however , waste my reader 's time upon them ; they will appear when required .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 11]: I shall , therefore , now proceed with my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 57]: It is usually the custom for the midshipmen to take up provisions and spirits beyond their allowance , and pay the purser an extra sum for the same ; but this Mr Culpepper would not permit -- indeed , he was the most stingy and disagreeable old fellow that I ever met with in the service .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 16]: We never had dinner or grog enough , or even lights sufficient for our wants .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 74]: We complained to the first lieutenant , but he was not inclined to assist us : he said we had our allowance , and it was all we could demand ; that too much grog was bad for us , and as for candles , they only made us sit up late when we ought to be in bed : he was , moreover , very strict about the lights being put out .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 19]: This , however , was the occasion of war to the knife between the midshipmen and Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 52]: But it was of no avail ; he would seldom trust his own steward or the mate of the main deck ; whenever he could , he superintended the serving out of all provisions and mixing of the grog : no wonder that he was said to be a rich man .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 35]: The only party to whom he was civil was Mr Hippesley , the first lieutenant , and the captain ; both of whom had the power of annoying him , and reducing his profits .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 81]: To the captain he was all humility ; every expense that he required was , with his proffered bow , cheerfully submitted to ; but he gained on the whole by this apparent liberality , as the captain was rather inclined to protect him in all other points of service , except those connected with his own comforts and luxuries ; and many a good job did Mr Culpepper get done for him , by humbly requesting and obsequiously bowing .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 29]: We had been at sea for about a week , and were running down towards the island of Madeira , which we expected to reach the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 22]: Our destination was a secret , as our captain sailed with sealed orders , to be opened when off that island .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 31]: The weather was very fine and warm , and the wind had fallen , when at sundown high land was reported from the mast-head , at about forty miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 33]: I was , as on the former cruise , signal midshipman , and did day duty -- that is , I went down with the sun , and kept no night watch .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 44]: I had been cogitating how I could play some trick to Mr Culpepper : the midshipmen had often proposed that we should do so , but I had made up my mind that , whenever I did , I would make no confidant .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 65]: Tommy Dott often suggested an idea , but I invariably refused , as a secret is only a secret when it is known to one person : for that reason I never consulted Bob Cross , because I knew that he would have persuaded me not to do so ; but after anything was happily executed , I then used to confide in him .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 33]: I observed before that Mr Culpepper wore a flaxen wig , and I felt sure , from his penuriousness , that he was not likely to have more than one on board .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 41]: I , therefore , fixed upon his wig as the object of my vengeance , and having made up my mind on the night that we made the island of Madeira , I determined to put my project in execution .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 47]: For convenience , the first lieutenant had a small ladder which went down through the skylight of the gun-room so that they could descend direct , instead of going round by the after-hatchway , and entering by the gun-room doors , where the sentry was placed .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 25]: I went to my hammock and slept till the middle watch was called ; I then got up and dressed myself without being perceived .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 63]: As soon as the lieutenant of the middle watch had been called by the mate , who lighted his candle and left him to dress himself , I came up by the after-ladder , and , watching an opportunity when the sentry at the captain 's cabin door had walked forward , I softly descended by the skylight ladder into the gun-room .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 84]: The light in the cabin of the lieutenant , who was dressing , was quite sufficient , and the heat of the weather was so great , that all the officers slept with their cabin doors fastened back , for ventilation ; I had , therefore , no difficulty in putting my hand on the purser 's wig , with which I escaped unperceived , and immediately turned in again to my hammock , to consider what I should do with my prize .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 51]: Should I throw it overboard ; should I stuff it down the pump-well , or slip it into the ship 's coppers , that it might re-appear when the pea-soup was baled out or dinner ; or should I put it into the manger forward , where the pigs were ?
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 39]: In the meantime , while I was considering the matter , the midshipman of the first watch came down and turned in , and all was again quiet , except an occasional nasal melody from some heavy sleeper .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 42]: At last , quite undecided , I peeped through the clews of my hammock to see what the sentry at the gun-room door was about , and found that he had sat down on a chest , and was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 39]: I knew immediately that the man was in my power , and I did not fear him ; and then it was that the idea came into my head , that I would singe the purser 's wig .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 35]: I went softly to the sentry 's light , took it from the hook , and went down with it into the cockpit , as being the best place for carrying on my operations .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 35]: The wig was very greasy , and every curl , as I held it in the candle , flared up , and burned beautifully to within a quarter of an inch of the caul .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 108]: It was soon done , and I replaced the sentry 's light ; and finding that the gun-room door was a-jar , I went in softly , and replaced the wig where I had taken it from , repassed the sentry , who was still fast asleep , and regained my hammock , intending to undress myself in it ; but I had quite forgotten one thing -LRB- I was soon reminded of it -RRB- -- I heard the voice of the officer of the watch I calling out to the sentry at the cabin door -- `` Sentry , what 's that smell of burning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 28]: `` I do n't know , sir , '' replied the sentry ; `` I was just thinking of going forward for the ship 's corporal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 24]: The smell , which had gradually ascended from the cockpit , now spread from deck to deck , and became stronger and stronger .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 26]: The gun-room-door sentry jumped up at the voice of the lieutenant , and called out that there was a very strong smell in the cockpit .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 30]: The lieutenant and mate of the watch came down , and it was immediately supposed that the spirit-room had caught fire , for the smell was really very powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 50]: The first lieutenant , who had wakened up at the voices , was out in a minute ; he put his head over the cockpit , and ordering the officer of the watch to call the drummer , and beat to quarters , ran up to inform the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 31]: The drummer was out in a moment , and , seizing his drum , which hung up by the mainmast , ran up in his shirt and beat the tattoo .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 43]: The whole ship 's company rose up at the sound , which they knew was the signal for something important ; and the beat of the drum was followed up by the shrill piping of the boatswain 's mates at each hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 33]: At that moment , some frightened man belonging to the watch cried out that the ship was on fire , and the lower decks were immediately a scene of bustle and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 39]: Perhaps there is nothing more awful than the alarm of fire at sea ; the feeling that there is no escape -- the only choice being by which element , fire or water , you choose to perish .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 31]: But if it is awful in daylight , how much more so is it to be summoned up to await such peril when you have been sleeping in fancied bounty .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 14]: The captain had hurried on his clothes , and stood on the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 26]: He was apparently calm and collected ; but , as usual , the first lieutenant carried on the duty , and well he did it .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 6]: `` Where 's the gunner ?
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 22]: Mr Hutt , bring up the keys from my cabin , and have all ready for clearing the magazines if required .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 14]: Firemen , get your buckets to bear ; carpenters , rig the pumps .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 8]: Silence there , fore and aft . ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: But the confusion became very great , and there evidently was a panic .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 22]: The captain then interposed , calling out to the boatswain and his mates to send every man aft on the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 20]: This order was obeyed ; the men came thronging like a flock of sheep , huddling together and breathless .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 15]: `` Silence there , my men , '' cried Captain Delmar -- `` silence .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 13]: I say ; is this the conduct of men-of-war 's - men ?
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 21]: Every man of you sit down on deck -- pass the word there for every man to sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 57]: The order was mechanically obeyed , and as soon as the ship 's company were all seated , the captain said -- `` I tell you what , my lads , I 'm ashamed of you : the way to put out a fire is to be cool and calm , obeying orders and keeping silence .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 25]: Now collect yourselves , all of you , for until you are all quiet and cool , you will sit where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 19]: After a pause of a few seconds -- `` Now , my men , are you more steady ?
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 9]: Recollect , be cool , and keep silence .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 8]: Carpenter , are the pumps rigged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 15]: `` Now , firemen , go for your buckets ; let nobody else move .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 15]: Silence -- not a word : three foremast guns main-deck , to your quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 8]: Silence and quiet , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 7]: Now , are you all steady ?
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 16]: -- then , to your quarters , my men , and wait for orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 24]: It was astonishing how collected the ship 's company became by the judicious conduct of the captain , who now continued to command .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 44]: When the men had gone down to their stations , he directed the two junior lieutenants to go and examine where the fire was , and to be careful not to lift the hatches if they discovered that it was in the spirit-room .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 87]: I had been on the quarter-deck some time , and , being aware of the cause , of course was not at all alarmed : and I had exerted myself very assiduously in keeping the men cool and quiet , shoving the men down who were unwilling to sit down on the deck , and even using them very roughly ; showing a great deal more _ sang froid _ than any other of the officers , which of course was not to be wondered at .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 75]: Mr Culpepper , who was most terribly alarmed , had come up on deck , and stood trembling close to the side of the captain and first lieutenant ; he had pulled on his wig without discovering that it had been burnt , and as I passed him , the burnt smell was very strong indeed ; so thought the captain and the first lieutenant , who were waiting the return of the officers .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 19]: `` I smell the fire very strong just now , '' said the captain to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 20]: `` Yes , sir , every now and then it is very strong , '' replied the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 17]: The purser 's wig was just between them , -- no wonder that they smelt it .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 31]: After two or three minutes the officers came up , and reported that they could discover no fire , and that there was very little smell of fire down below .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 13]: `` And yet I smell it now , '' said Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 28]: `` So do I , sir , '' said the second lieutenant ; `` and it really smells stronger on deck than it does down below . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 13]: `` It 's very odd ; let them continue the search . ''
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 29]: The search was continued ; the first lieutenant now going down , and after a time they said that the strongest smell was from the purser 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 35]: `` Mr Culpepper , they say the smell is in your cabin , '' said Captain Delmar ; `` go down , if you please ; they may want to open your lockers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 41]: Mr Culpepper , who still trembled like an aspen , went down the ladder , and I followed him ; but in descending the second ladder his foot slipped , and he fell down the hatchway to the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 33]: I hastened down after him ; he was stunned , and I thought this a good opportunity to pull off his wig , which I did very dexterously , and concealed it .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 29]: He was taken into the gun-room , and the surgeon called , while I walked up on deck , and quietly dropped the wig overboard at the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 92]: My reason for doing this was , that having no idea that my trick would have created so much confusion , and have turned up the officers and men as it did , I thought that the purser 's wig would , the next morning , account for the smell of fire , and an investigation take place , which , although it might not lead to discovery , would certainly lead to suspicion ; so the wig was now floating away , and with the wig went away all evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 28]: After a search of nearly half an hour , nothing was discovered ; the drummer was ordered to beat the retreat , and all was quiet again .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 28]: I went to bed quite satisfied with the events of the night , and slept the sleep of innocence -- at least I slept just as soundly .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 54]: This mysterious affair ever remained a mystery : the only loss was the purser 's wig , but that was nothing , as Mr Culpepper acknowledged that he did not know himself what he was about , and , for all he knew to the contrary , he might have thrown it overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 11]: My conduct on this occasion again gained me great credit .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 16]: It had been remarked by the captain and officers , and I rose in estimation .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 28]: How I might have behaved had I really supposed that the ship was on fire , is quite another affair -- I presume not quite so fearlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 38]: As it was , I was resolved to take all the credit given to me and for that reason it was not till a long while afterwards , that I hinted the secret even to Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 43]: The next morning , when we arrived at Funchal , we found that our orders were for the West Indies : we stayed one day to take in wine and then hove up the anchor , and went on to our destination .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 31]: We soon got into the trades , and run them fast down till we arrived at Carlisle Bay , Barbadoes , where we found the admiral and delivered our despatches .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 22]: We were ordered to water and complete as soon as possible , as we were to be sent on a cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 11]: Tommy Dott , my quondam ally , was in disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 32]: He had several times during the cruise proposed that I should join him in several plots of mischief , but I refused , as I did not consider them quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 38]: `` You are not the keen fellow I thought you were , '' said he ; `` you are up to nothing now ; there 's no fun in you , as there used to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 37]: He was mistaken ; there was fun in me , but there was also prudence , and from what I had latterly seen of Tommy Dott , I did not think he was to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 33]: The day after we anchored at Carlisle Bay , Tommy came to me and said , `` Old Culpepper serves out plums and suet this afternoon ; I heard him tell steward .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 23]: Now , I think we may manage to get some -- I never saw better plums on board of a ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 26]: `` Well , '' said I , `` I like raisins as well as you do , Tommy -- but what is your plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 32]: `` Why , I 've got my squirt : and old Culpepper never lights more than one of his purser 's dips -LRB- small candles -RRB- in the steward 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 44]: I 'll get down in the cockpit in the dark , and squirt at the candle -- the water will put it out , and he 'll send the steward for another light , and then I 'll try and get some . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 30]: It was not a bad plan , but still I refused to join in it , as it was only the work of one person , and not two .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 20]: I pointed that out to him and he agreed with me , saying that he would do it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 25]: When Mr Culpepper went down into the steward 's room , Tommy reconnoitred , and then came into the berth and filled his squirt .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 47]: Although I would not join him , I thought I might as well see what was going on and therefore descended the cockpit ladder soon after Tommy , keeping out of the way in the foremost part of the cockpit , where it was quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 28]: Tommy directed his squirt very dexterously , hit the lighted wick of the solitary candle , which fizzed , sputtered , and finally gave up the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 5]: `` Bless me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 11]: said Mr Culpepper , `` what can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 27]: `` A leak from the seams above I suppose , '' said the steward : `` I will go to the gallery for another light . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 31]: `` Yes , yes , be quick , '' said Mr Culpepper , who remained in the steward 's room in the dark , until the return of the steward .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 56]: Tommy Dott then slipped in softly , and commenced filling all his pockets with the raisins ; he had nearly taken in his full cargo , when , somehow or another , Mr Culpepper stepped forward from where he stood , and he touched Tommy , whom he immediately seized crying out , `` Thieves !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 2]: thieves !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 5]: -- call the sentry !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 7]: -- sentry , come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 24]: The sentry of the gun-room door went down the ladder as Mr Culpepper dragged out Tommy , holding him fast by both hands .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 11]: `` Take him , sentry -- take him in charge .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 7]: Call the master-at-arms -- little thief .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 3]: Mr Dott !
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: Hah -- well , we 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 32]: The consequence was , that Mr Tommy Dott was handed from the sentry to the master-at-arms , and taken up on the quarterdeck , followed by Mr Culpepper and his steward .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 45]: There was no defence or excuse to be made : the pockets of his jacket and of his trowsers were stuffed with raisins ; and at the bottom of his pocket , when they were emptied by the master-at-arms , was found the squirt .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 81]: As soon as the hue and cry was over , and all the parties were on the quarter-deck , as the coast was clear , I thought I might as well take advantage of it ; and therefore I came out from my hiding-place , went into the steward 's room , filled my handkerchief with raisins , and escaped to the berth unperceived ; so that while Tommy Dott was disgorging on the quarter-deck , I was gorging below .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 52]: Mr Dott was reported to the captain for this heinous offence ; and , in consequence , was ordered below under arrest , his place in the captain 's gig being filled up by me ; so that in every point of view Tommy suffered , and I reaped the harvest .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 31]: What pleased me most was , that , being midshipman of the captain 's boat , I was of course continually in the company of the coxswain , Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 38]: But I must not delay at present , as I have to record a very serious adventure which occurred , and by which I , for a long while , was separated from my companions and shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 32]: In ten days we sailed in search of a pirate vessel , which was reported to have committed many dreadful excesses , and had become the terror of the mercantile navy .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 26]: Our orders were to proceed northward , and to cruise off the Virgin Islands , near which she was said to have been last seen .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 21]: About three weeks after we had left Carlisle Bay , the look-out man reported two strange sail from the mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 35]: I was sent up , as signal mid , to examine them , and found that they were both schooners , hove to close together ; one of them very rakish in their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 40]: All sail in chase was made immediately , and we came up within three miles of them , when one , evidently the pirate we were in search of , made sail , while the other remained hove to .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 49]: As we passed the vessel hove to , which we took it for granted was a merchantman , which the pirate had been plundering , the captain ordered one of the cutters to be lowered down with a midshipman and boat 's crew to take possession of her .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 97]: The men were all in the boat , but the midshipman had gone down for his spy-glass , or something else , and as it was merely with a view of ascertaining what the vessel was , and the chief object was to overtake the pirate vessel , to prevent the delay which was caused by the other midshipman not being ready , Mr Hippesley ordered me to go into the boat instead of him , and , as soon as I was on board of the schooner , to make sail and follow the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 19]: The captain did say , `` He is too young , Mr Hippesley ; is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 21]: `` I 'd sooner trust him than many older , sir , '' was the reply of the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 8]: `` Jump in , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 11]: I did so , with my telescope in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 40]: `` Lower away , my lads -- unhook , and sheer off ; '' and away went the frigate in pursuit of the pirate vessel , leaving me in the boat , to go on board of the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 53]: We were soon alongside , and found that there was not a soul on board of the vessel ; what had become of the crew , whether they had been murdered , or not , it was impossible to say , but there were a few drops of blood on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 53]: The vessel was an American , bound to one of the islands , with shingle and fir planks ; not only was her hold full , but the fir planks were piled up on each side of the deck , between the masts , to the height of five or six feet .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 19]: The pirate had , apparently , been taking some of the planks on board for her own use .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 34]: We dropped the boat astern , let draw the foresheet , and made sail after the frigate , which was now more than a mile from us , and leaving us very fast .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 62]: The schooner was so over-loaded that she sailed very badly , and before the evening closed in , we could just perceive the top-gallant sails of the Calliope above the horizon : but this we thought little of , as we knew that as soon as she had captured the pirate she would run back again , and take us out .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 44]: There were some hams and other articles on board , for the pirates had not taken everything , although the lockers had been all broken open , and the articles were strewed about in every direction in the cabin and on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 37]: Just before dark , we took the bearings of the frigate , and stood the same course as she was doing , and then we sat down to a plentiful meal to which we did justice .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 61]: I then divided the boat 's crew into watches , went down into the cabin , and threw myself on the standing bed-place , of which there was but one , with all my clothes on ; the men who had not the watch went down , and turned in in the cuddy forward , where the seamen usually sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 48]: It was not till past midnight that I could obtain any sleep ; the heat was excessive , and I was teased by the cockroaches , which appeared to swarm in the cabin to an incredible degree , and were constantly running over my face and body .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 8]: I little thought then why they swarmed .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 65]: I recollect that I dreamt of murder , and tossing men overboard ; and then of the vessel being on fire and after that , I felt very cool and comfortable , and I dreamed no more ; I thought that I heard a voice calling my name : it appeared that I did hear it in my sleep , but I slept on .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 25]: At last I turned round , and felt a splashing as of water , and some water coming into my mouth : I awoke .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 28]: All was dark and quiet ; I put my hand out , and I put it into the water -- where was I -- was I overboard ?
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 25]: I jumped up in my fright ; I found that was still on the standing bed-place , but the water was above the mattress .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 20]: I immediately comprehended that the vessel was sinking , and I called out , but there was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 24]: I turned out of the bed-place , and found myself up to my neck in water , with my feet on the cabin-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 18]: Half swimming , and half floundering , I gained the ladder , and went up the hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 15]: It was still quite dark , and I could not perceive nor hear anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 9]: I called out but there was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 26]: I then was certain that the men had left the vessel when they round her sinking , and had left me to sink with her .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 104]: I may as well here observe , that when the men had found the water rising upon them forward they had rushed on deck in a panic , telling the man at the wheel that the vessel was sinking , and had immediately hauled up the boat to save their lives ; but they did recollect me , and the coxswain of the boat had come down in the cabin by the ladder , and called me : but the cabin was full of water , and he , receiving no answer , considered that I was drowned , and returned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 46]: The boat had then shoved off , and I was left to my fate ; still I hoped that such was not the case , and I hallooed again and again , but in vain , and I thought it was all over with me .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 9]: It was a dreadful position to be in .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 23]: I said my prayers and prepared to die , and yet I thought it was hard to die at fifteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 46]: Although I do not consider that my prayers were of much efficacy , for there was but little resignation in them , praying had one good effect -- it composed me , and I began to think whether there was any chance of being saved .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 32]: Yes , there were plenty of planks on the deck , and if it were daylight I could tie them together and make a raft , which would bear me up .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 25]: How I longed for daylight , for I was afraid that the vessel would sink before I could see to do what was requisite .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 23]: The wind had become much fresher during the night , and the waves now dashed against the sides of the water-logged vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 43]: As I watched for daylight , I began to reflect how this could have happened ; and it occurred to me that the pirates had scuttled the bottom of the vessel to sink her ; and in this conjecture I was right .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 28]: At last a faint light appeared in the east , which soon broke into broad day , and I lost no time in setting about my work .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 39]: Before I began , however , I thought it advisable to ascertain how much more water there was in the vessel since I had quitted the cabin which it appeared to me must have been about two hours .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 11]: I therefore went down in the cabin to measure it .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 12]: I know how high it was when I waded through it .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 27]: I found , to my surprise , and , I may say , to my joy , that it was not higher than it was before .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 42]: I thought that perhaps I might be mistaken , so I marked the height of the water at the cabin ladder , and I sat down on deck to watch it ; it appeared to me not to rise any higher .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 40]: This made me reflect , and it then struck me that , as the vessel was laden with timber , she would not probably sink any lower , so I deferred my work till I had ascertained the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 60]: Three hours did I watch , and found that the water did not rise higher , and I was satisfied ; but the wind increased , and the vessel 's sails , instead of flapping to the wind as she drove without any one at the helm , were now bellied out , and the vessel careened to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 37]: I was afraid that she would turn over ; and finding an axe on the deck , I mounted the rigging with it , and commenced cutting away the lacing of the sails from the mast .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 25]: I then lowered the gaffs , and cleared away the canvass in the same way , so that the sails fell on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 22]: This was a work of at least one hour ; but when the canvass was off , the vessel was steady .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 33]: It was well that I had taken this precaution ; for very soon afterwards the wind was much fresher , and the weather appeared very threatening ; the sea also rose considerably .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 16]: I was very tired , and sat down for some time on the deck abaft .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 69]: It then occurred to me that the weight of the planks upon the deck must not only keep the vessel deeper in the water , but make her more top-heavy , and I determined to throw them overboard ; but first I looked for something to eat , and found plenty of victuals in the iron pot in which the men had cooked their supper the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 41]: As soon as I had obtained from the cask lashed on the deck a drink of water , to wash down the cold fried ham which I had eaten , I set work to throw overboard the planks on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 40]: When I had thrown over a portion from one side I went to the other , and threw over as many more , that I might , as much as possible , keep the vessel on an even keel .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 41]: This job occupied me the whole of the day ; and when I had completed my task I examined the height of the water at the cabin ladder , and found that the vessel had risen more than six inches .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 32]: This was a source of great comfort to me , and what pleased me more was , that the wind had gone down again , and the water was much smoother .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 46]: I made a supper off some raw ham , for the fire had been extinguished , and committing myself to the protection of Heaven , lay down as the sun set , and from the fatigue of the day was soon in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: I awoke about the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: The stars shone brightly , and there was but a slight ripple on the water .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 29]: I thought of my mother , of my aunt Milly , of Captain Delmar , and I felt for the seal-skin pouch which was fastened round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 5]: It was all safe .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 24]: I calculated chances , and I made up my mind that I should be picked up by some vessel or another before long .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 38]: I said to myself -- `` Why , I am better off now than I was when in the wherry , with Peggy Pearson ; I was saved then , why should I not be now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 15]: I felt no desponding , and lay down , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 30]: It was broad daylight when I awoke ; I took my spy-glass , and looking round the horizon , discovered a vessel several miles off , standing towards me .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 6]: This gave me fresh spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 14]: I made a raw breakfast , and drank plenty of water as before .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: The wind , which was very light , increased a little .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 15]: The vessel came nearer , and I made her out to be a schooner .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 23]: In two hours she was close to me , and I waved my hat , and hallooed as loud as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 56]: The schooner was full of men , and steered close to me -- she was a beautiful craft , and , although the wind was so light , glided very fast through the water , and I could not help thinking that she was the pirate vessel which the frigate had been in chase of .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 19]: It appeared as if they intended to pass me , and I hallooed , `` Schooner , ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 11]: Why do n't you send a boat on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 23]: I must say , that when the idea struck me that she was a pirate vessel , my heart almost failed me .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: Shortly afterwards the schooner rounded to and lowered a boat , which pulled to the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 8]: The boat 's crew were all negroes .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 42]: One of them said , `` Jump in , you white boy ; next jump he take be into the shark 's mouth , '' continued the man , grinning , as he addressed himself to the others in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 14]: I got into the boat , and they rowed on board the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 37]: I did then think that I was done for ; for what mercy could I expect , being a king 's officer , from pirates , which the words of the negro convinced me they were ?
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 30]: As soon as I was alongside of the schooner , they ordered me to go up the side , which I did , with my spy-glass in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 28]: I leaped from the gunwale down on the deck , and found myself on board of an armed vessel , with a crew wholly composed of blacks .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 23]: I was rudely seized by two of them , who led me aft to where a negro stood apart from the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 13]: A more fierce , severe , determined-looking countenance , I never beheld .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: He was gigantic in stature and limbed like the Farnesian Hercules .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 10]: `` Well , boy , who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 15]: said he , `` and how came you on board of that vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 8]: I told him in very few words .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 16]: `` Then you belong to that frigate that chased us the day before yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` What is her name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 5]: `` The Calliope . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 9]: `` She sails well , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` she is the fastest sailer on this station . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 19]: `` That 's all the information I want of you , boy : now you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 5]: `` Go where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 6]: replied I. `` Go where ?
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 16]: -- go overboard , to be sure , '' replied he , with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 41]: My heart died within me ; but I mustered courage enough to say , `` Much obliged to you , sir ; but I 'd rather stay where I am , if it 's all the same to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 36]: The other negroes laughed at this reply , and I felt a little confidence ; at all events , their good-humour gave me courage , and I felt that being bold was my only chance .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 28]: The negro captain looked at me for a time , as if considering , and at last said to the men , `` Overboard with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 33]: `` Good-bye , sir , you 're very kind , '' said I ; `` but this is a capital spy-glass , and I leave it to you as a legacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 12]: And I went up to him and offered him my spy-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 3]: Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 12]: bow my heart beat against my ribs when I did this !
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 12]: The negro captain took the glass , and looked through it .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 19]: `` It is a good glass , '' said he , as he removed it from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 20]: It was poor Green 's spy-glass , which he had given me for showing him the mason 's signs .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 18]: `` Well , white boy , I accept your present ; and now , good bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 5]: `` Good-bye , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 22]: Do me one kindness in return , '' said I , very gravely , for I felt my hour was come .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 4]: replied the negro .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 22]: `` Tie a shot to my heels , that I may sink quickly ; it wo n't take them long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 14]: `` You do n't ask me to spare your life , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 4]: replied the negro .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 18]: `` He de very first white dat not ask it , '' said one of the negroes .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 10]: `` Dat really for true , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 11]: `` Yes , by gum , '' replied a third .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: Oh , how I wished to know what to say at that moment !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 26]: The observations of the negroes made me imagine that I had better not _ ask _ for it and yet how I clung to life !
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 20]: It was an awful moment -- I felt as if I had lived a year in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 19]: For a second or two I felt faint and giddy -- I drew a long breath and revived .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 15]: `` You do n't answer me , boy , '' said the negro captain .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 13]: `` Why should I ask when I feel certain to be refused ?
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 27]: If you will give me my life , I will thank you : I do n't particularly wish to die , I can assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 13]: `` I have taken an oath never to spare a white man .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 14]: For once I am sorry that I can not break my oath . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 28]: `` If that is all , I am a boy , and not a man , '' replied I. `` Keep me till I grow bigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 11]: `` By golly , captain , that very well said .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 12]: Keep him , captain , '' said one of the negroes .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 17]: `` Yes , captain , '' replied another ; `` keep him to tend your cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 8]: Proper you have white slave boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 18]: The negro captain for some time made no reply ; he appeared to be in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 22]: At last he said -- `` Boy , you have saved your life : you may thank yourself and not me .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 29]: Prossa , let him be taken below ; give him a frock and trousers and throw that infernal dress overboard , or I may change my resolution . ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 39]: The negro who was addressed , and who wore a sort of uniform as an officer -- which he was , being second mate -- led me below , -- nothing loth , I can assure my readers .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 6]: When I was between decks .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 15]: I sat down upon a chest , my head swam , and I fainted .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 13]: The shock had been too powerful for a lad of my age .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 8]: They brought water , and recovered me .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 35]: When I revived , I felt that I might have lost in their good opinion by thus knowing my weakness ; and I had sufficient presence of mind to ask for something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 33]: This deceived them ; they said to one another that I must have been on board that vessel for two days without food , and of course I did not deny it .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 9]: They brought me some meat and some grog .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 7]: I ate and drank a little .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 46]: They then took off my uniform , and put on me a check frock and white trousers ; after which , I said I wished to lie down a little , and they left me to sleep on the chest where I had been seated .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 37]: I pretended to sleep , although I could not ; and I found out by their conversation that I gained the goodwill not only of the crew , but of the captain , by my behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 25]: I considered that I had gained my life , at least for the present ; but what security could I have in such company ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 20]: After an hour or two I felt quite recovered , and I thought it advisable to go on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 18]: I did so , and went right aft to the negro captain , and stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 18]: `` Well , boy , '' said he , `` why do you come to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 22]: `` You gave me my life ; you 're the greatest friend I have here , so I come to you .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 6]: Can I do anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 28]: `` Yes ; you may assist in the cabin , if your white blood does not curdle at the idea of attending on a black man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 18]: I will do anything for them who are kind to me , as you have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 8]: `` And think it no disgrace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 5]: `` Not the least .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 9]: Is it a disgrace to be grateful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 17]: The reader will observe how particularly judicious my replies were , although but fifteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 13]: My dangerous position had called forth the reflection and caution of manhood .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 16]: `` Go down into the cabin ; you may amuse yourself till I come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 5]: I obeyed this order .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 45]: The cabin was fitted up equal to most yachts , with Spanish mahogany and gold mouldings ; a beaufet full of silver -LRB- there was no glass -RRB- occupied nearly one-half of it ; even the plates and dishes were of the same material .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 83]: Silver candelabras hung down from the middle of the beams ; a variety of swords , pistols , and other weapons were fixed up against the bulkhead ; a small bookcase , chiefly of Spanish books , occupied the after-bulkhead , and the portraits of several white females filled up the intervals ; a large table in the centre , a stand full of charts , half a dozen boxes of cigars , and two most luxurious sofas , completed the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 29]: A door from the starboard side led , I presumed , to the stateroom , where the captain slept ; but I did not venture to open it .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 39]: I surveyed all this magnificence , wondering who this personage could be ; and more still , how it was that the whole of the crew were , as well as the captain , of the negro race .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 40]: We had heard that the pirate we were in search of was a well-known character -- a Spaniard -- who went by the name of Chico , and that his crew consisted of Americans , English , and Spaniards .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 26]: That this was the vessel , I knew , from the conversation of the men when I was below for they called her the Stella .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 50]: Now , it appeared that the vessel had changed masters ; the crew were chiefly Spanish negroes , or other negroes who spoke Spanish , but some of them spoke English , and a few words of Spanish ; these , I presumed , were American or English runaways .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 43]: But the captain -- his language was as correct as my own ; Spanish he spoke fluently , for I heard him giving orders in that language while I was in the cabin ; neither was he flat-nosed , like the majority .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 29]: Had he been white , his features would have been considered regular , although there was a fierceness about them at times which was terrible to look at .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 68]: `` Well , '' thought I , `` if I live and do well , I shall know more about it ; yes , if I live , I wish I was on the quarterdeck of the Calliope , even as Tommy was with his pockets stuffed full of the purser 's raisins , and looking like a fool and a rogue at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 20]: I had been down in the cabin about half an hour , when the negro captain made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 25]: `` Well , '' said he , `` I suppose you would as soon see the devil as me -- eh , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 44]: `` No : indeed , '' replied I , laughing -- for I had quite recovered my confidence -- `` for you were about to send me to the devil , and I feel most happy that I still remain with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 17]: `` You 're exactly the cut of boy I like , '' replied he , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 9]: `` How I wish that you were black !
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 7]: -- I detest your colour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 33]: `` I have no objection to black my face , if you wish it , '' replied I : `` it 's all the same to me what colour I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 7]: `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 10]: `` I was fifteen a few months back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 10]: `` How long have you been to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 6]: `` About eighteen months . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 34]: He then asked me a great many more questions , about the captain , the officers , the ship , and myself ; to all of which I answered in a guarded way .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 31]: A negro brought down his supper ; it was hot , and very savoury ; without any order on his part , I immediately attended upon him during his meal .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 35]: He told the negro not to wait and conversed with me during the time that he was eating : at last , he told me how he had doubled the frigate during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 36]: I then remarked that we had been informed that the vessel was called the Stella , that the captain 's name was Chico , and the crew were composed of white men of different nations .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 17]: `` A month or two ago , it was the case , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 30]: `` Now I have done , and you may clear away , '' continued he , rising from his chair and throwing himself down on one of the sofas .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 28]: `` Stop ; you are hungry , I do n't doubt ; you can sit down and eat your supper , and remove the things afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 57]: I did as he told me : it was the first time in my life I had supped off massive plate -- but I was in strange company ; however , it did not spoil my appetite , and I did not forget to drink a goblet of wine by way of washing down my repast .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 20]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said I , rising , and then performing my office of attendant .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 30]: At his order , I rang the bell for the negro , who assisted me in clearing away , and then went out with the remains of the supper .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 9]: `` Am I to stay or go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 5]: said I , respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 6]: `` You may go now .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 25]: Find the man who came in just now -- Jose he is called ; tell him to give you something to sleep upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 14]: `` Good-night , sir , '' said I. `` Good-night , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 23]: As I went forward looking for the negro servant , I was accosted more than once very kindly by the negro seamen .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 25]: At last I went up on the forecastle , and they asked me to tell them how I was left on board the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 30]: I did so to those who spoke English , and one of them , who could speak both languages , translated into Spanish for the benefit of the others .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 39]: `` You be first white he hab spared , I tell you , '' said the American negro , who had translated into Spanish what I had told them , after the other had left me with him .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 44]: `` The captain says he wishes I were black , '' said I to the negro ; `` I wish I was , too , while I am on board of this vessel -- my colour makes him angry , I see that .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 8]: Could not I be stained black ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 60]: `` Well , I do think it will be a very safe thing for you , if it could be ; for you have not seen him sometimes in his moods ; and if to-morrow morning he was chased and hard pressed by the frigate , you would stand a poor chance , suppose his eyes light upon you .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 25]: I ca n't tink what make him to let you off , only but cause you give him de spy-glass in dat hold way .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 25]: I tink I know a chap on board who understand dat -- I go see -- you wait here till I come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 30]: The negro left me , and in a few minutes returned , with a sort of half-Indian , half-negro-looking cut of fellow , with whom he conversed in Spanish .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 18]: `` He say he know how to make brown like himself but not dark same as me .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 12]: Suppose you wish he do it to-night -- begin now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 64]: `` Yes , I do wish it , '' replied I ; and so I did sincerely , for I felt that it might be the saving of my life ; and I had a great aversion to be torn to pieces by the sharks which followed the vessel , that being anything but an agreeable mode of going out of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 41]: The American black remained with me , and we conversed for about half an hour , by which time we were joined by the Spanish Main negro , who brought up with him some decoction or another , boiling hot .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 57]: They stripped me and rubbed me all over with a bit of sponge , not only the face and hands , but every part of my body and then I was left standing quite naked to dry ; the crew had gathered round us , and were very merry at the idea of changing my colour .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 58]: As soon as the warm air had dried me , the application was created ; and when I was again dry , the American told me to put on my clothes , and that he would call me early to have two more applications of the stuff , and that then I should be quite dark enough .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 32]: I asked for Jose , and told him what the captain had said ; he gave me a bundle of matting for a bed , and I was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 24]: About three o'clock in the morning I was called up , and the staining repeated twice , and I then lay down again .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 44]: When the hands were turned up at five bells -LRB- for everything was very regular on board -RRB- , Jose brought me a glass to look at myself , and I was quite satisfied that my colour would no longer annoy the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 18]: I was not as black as a negro , but I was as dark as a mulatto .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 21]: I asked the Spanish negro , through Jose , who could speak both languages , whether I might wash myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 42]: He replied , all day long if I pleased ; that I should not get the colour off ; it would wear off in time , and the stuff must be applied once a month , and that would be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 33]: I went to the forecastle , and washed myself ; the negro crew were much amused , and said that I now was a `` bel muchaco '' -- a handsome boy .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 29]: I dare say they thought so -- at all events , they appeared to be very friendly with me , and my staining myself gave them great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 13]: I was sitting with Jose between decks when the cabin bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 27]: `` You go , '' said he , showing his white teeth as he grinned ; `` I go after , see what captain tink . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 13]: I went into the cabin , and knocked at the state-room door .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 9]: `` Come in , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 11]: I went in , and met him face to face .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 23]: said he , looking earnestly at me -- `` yet it must be -- it is you , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I , `` it is me .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 17]: I 've turned dark to please you , and I hope it does please you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 20]: `` It does , boy , I can look at you now , and forget that you are white .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 3]: I can .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 27]: I feel that I can love you now -- you 've got rid of your only fault in my eyes , and I 'm not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 25]: I 'm only glad that I did not -- '' `` Give me to the sharks , '' said I , finishing his sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 11]: `` Exactly so ; say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 20]: I immediately turned the conversation , by asking him what he required ; and I attended him while dressing .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 15]: From that time he became very friendly towards me , constantly conversing with me .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 49]: I did my duty as his servant for more than a fortnight , during which time we became very intimate , and -LRB- I may as well confess it -RRB- I grew very fond of my new master , and thought less about the ship and my shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 18]: We were going into a port , I knew , but what port I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 34]: I often had conversations with Jose and the American black , and gained a great deal of information from them ; but I could not discover much of the history of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 26]: On that point they refused to be communicative ; occasionally hints were given , and then , as if recollecting themselves , they stopped speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 47]: It was about three weeks before we made the land of Cuba , and as soon as we did so , the schooner was hove to till night , when sail was again made , and before ten o'clock we saw the lights of the Havannah .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 30]: When about three miles off we again hove to , and about midnight we perceived under the land the white sails of a schooner , which was standing out .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 36]: Sail was made , and we ran down to her , and before she was aware that we were an enemy , she was laid by the board and in the possession of our crew .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 15]: The people belonging to the vessel were handed up , and she was examined .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 32]: She proved to be a vessel fitted out for the slave trade , with the manacles , etcetera , on board of her , and was just sailing for the coast .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 33]: I was on the deck when the white men , belonging to the slaver , were brought on board , and never shall I forget the rage and fury of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 27]: All sail was made upon both schooners , standing right off from the land , and at daylight we had left it a long way astern .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 15]: Jose said to me , `` You better not go to captain dis day .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 14]: Keep out of his way -- perhaps he recollect dat you white . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 35]: From what I had seen the night before , I thought this good advice ; and I not only did not go into the cabin , but I did not show myself on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 29]: About eight o'clock in the morning I heard the boat lowered down and orders given to scuttle the vessel , as soon as she had been well searched .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 25]: This was done , and the boat returned , having found several thousand dollars on board of her , which they handed upon deck .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 49]: I remained below : I heard the angry voice of the negro captain -- the pleadings and beggings for mercy of the prisoners -- busy preparations making on deck ; and several men came down and handed up buckets of sand ; an iron grating was handed up .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 36]: The countenances of the negroes who were thus employed appeared inflamed , as if their wrath was excited ; now and then they laughed at each other , and looked more like demons than men .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 23]: That some dreadful punishment was about to be inflicted I was certain and I remained crouched behind the foremast on the lower-deck .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 71]: At last the men were all on deck again , and I was left alone ; and then I heard more noise , begging for mercy , weeping and wailing , and occasionally a few words from the mouth of the negro captain ; then rose shrieks and screams , and appeals to Heaven , and a strong smell , which I could not comprehend , came down the hatchways .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 16]: The shrieks grew fainter , and at last ceased , and something was thrown overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 29]: Then the same tragedy , whatever it was , was acted over again -- more attempts to obtain mercy -- more shrieks -- again the same overpowering smell .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 5]: What could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 20]: I would have given much to know , but something told me that I must remain where I was .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 31]: Ten times was this repeated , and then , as evening came on , there was a bustle on deck , and after a time the crew descended the hatchways .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 25]: I caught the eye of the American , with whom I was intimate , and as he passed me , I beckoned to him .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 5]: He came to me .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 7]: `` What has been done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 6]: said I in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 17]: `` Captain punish slave traders , '' replied he ; `` always punish them so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 11]: `` Why , what did he do to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 3]: `` Do ?
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 5]: -- roast 'em alive .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 14]: Dis third slave vessel he take , and he always serve 'em so .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 21]: Serve 'em right ; captain very savage ; no go to him till morrow morning -- you keep close . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 9]: So saying , the American negro left me .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 55]: As I afterwards found out , the long boat on the booms had been cleared out , the sand laid at the bottom to prevent the fire from burning the boat , the captain and crew of the slave vessel laid on one after the other upon the iron grating , and burnt alive .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 13]: This accounted for the horrible smell that had come down the hatchways .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 22]: It may be considered strange that I really did not feel so much horror as perhaps I ought to have done .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 95]: Had this dreadful punishment been inflicted upon any _ other _ persons than slave dealers , and _ by _ any other parties than negroes , I should not have been able to look at the captain without abhorrence expressed in my countenance ; but I know well the horrors of the slave trade from conversation I had had with Bob Cross ; and I had imbibed such a hatred against the parties who had carried it on , that it appeared to me to be an act of retaliation almost allied to justice .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 53]: Had the negro captain only warred against slave dealers , I do not think I should have cared about remaining in the vessel ; but he had told me and fully proved to me , that he detested all white men , and had never spared them except in my own instance .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 51]: I must acknowledge that I felt very much like going into the lion 's den , when the next morning , on his ringing the cabin bell , I presented myself to the captain ; but so far from being in an ill-humour , he was very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 54]: After breakfast , as I was going out , he said to me , `` You must have a name : I shall call you Cato -- recollect that ; and now I have a question to ask you -- What is that which you carry round your neck on a ribbon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 13]: `` A letter , sir , '' replied I. `` A letter !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 9]: and why do you carry a letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 12]: `` Because it is of the greatest importance to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 19]: Now , Cato , sit down on the other sofa , and let me know your history . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 18]: I felt that I could not do better than to make this man at once my confidant .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 18]: He might take a strong interest in me , and it was not likely to go farther .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 26]: I therefore told him everything connected with my birth and parentage , what my suspicions had been , and how the letter had confirmed them .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 29]: I unsewed the seal-skin , and gave him the letter to read -- without being aware that he could read : he took it and read it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 59]: `` Yes , '' said he , `` that 's proof under his own hand ; and now , Cato , never be afraid of me , for , however I may wreak my vengeance upon others , I swear _ by my colour _ that I never will hurt you , or permit others to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 32]: I am a tiger -- I know it ; but you have often seen a little spaniel caressed by the tiger , whose fangs are turned against every other living thing .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: You are quite safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 44]: `` I feel I am , since you say so , '' replied I ; `` and since I am to be your pet , I shall take liberties , and ask you , in return , to tell me your history . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 18]: `` I am glad that you have asked it , as I wish you to know it .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 23]: I will begin at once -- `` I was born in America , in the state of Pennsylvania , of free parents .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 28]: My father was a sail-maker , and was worth money ; bet a free black in America is even worse treated and more despised than a slave .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 12]: I had two brothers , who went to school with me .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 12]: `` My father intended to bring me up for the Church .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 53]: You look astonished ; but in the States we have clergymen of our colour , as well as white ones ; looked down upon and despised , I grant , although they do teach the Word of God ; but I was very unfit for that profession , as you may suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 31]: I was very proud and haughty ; I felt that I was as good as a white man , and I very often got into scrapes from my resenting injuries .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 23]: `` However , my education went on successfully , much more so than that of my brothers , who could not learn .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 55]: I could , and learnt rapidly but I learnt to hate and detest white men , and more especially Americans ; I brooded over the injuries of people of colour , as we were called , and all my father 's advice and entreaty could not persuade me to keep my thoughts to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 45]: As I grew up to manhood , I spoke boldly , and more than once nearly lost my life for so doing ; for most Americans think no more of taking the life of one like me than of a dog in the street .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 55]: More than one knife has been directed to my heart , and more than once was I then up before the judge , and sentenced to imprisonment for no fault ; my evidence , and the evidence of those of my colour , not being permitted to be received in a court of justice .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 26]: Any white villain had only to swear falsely -- and there is no want of that class in America -- and there was no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 27]: At last I was sentenced to be whipped ; then my blood boiled , and I vowed a vengeance which I have fearfully adhered to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 21]: `` I do not wonder at that , '' said I ; `` I would have done the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 38]: `` The man who had sworn falsely against me in this last instance had come up from the South ; I obtained what money I could from my father , and went away in pursuit of him .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 22]: I found him -- dogged him , and one evening I accosted him , and plunged my bowie-knife into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 10]: I fled that State , and crossed the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 57]: `` I had not been long in Arkansas before a man -- a cotton-grower , who owned about a hundred and fifty slaves -- inquired who I was , and whether I had a pass ; I replied that I was a free man , born in Pennsylvania , and was there on my own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 32]: The next day I was taken up , brought before the magistrate , and this scoundrel swore that I was his slave , and had absconded from him ten years before .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 17]: `` My defence -- the proof which I offered to bring , was not listened to .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 20]: I was made over to him , and the rascal grinned as the constables brought me away with him .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 8]: His plantation was at the Red River .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 35]: It was difficult to escape and indeed , almost useless to attempt it : but the fact was , that I did not wish to do so ; I remained to have my revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 42]: I tried to make the other slaves rise against him , but they were too cowed ; they even informed against me , and I was tied down , and flogged by the drivers until the flesh fell from my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 15]: `` As soon as I recovered , I determined to do -- or die .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 34]: I heard that there were some pirate vessels in the Barataria lagoons on the other side of New Orleans ; I resolved to join the crews , but first to have my revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 46]: I did so : I set fire to the plantation house -- struck the scoundrel who had made me a slave senseless as he attempted to escape , and threw his body into the flames ; I then made the door fast , and fled .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 36]: I was met by one of the overseers , who was armed , and who would have stopped me : I beat his brains out with his own musket , and then gained the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 14]: You see that I am powerful ; you hardly know how much so .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 12]: After several days ' travelling , I arrived at the lagoons .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 8]: I found this very vessel at anchor .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 10]: I offered myself , and they accepted me immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 19]: `` There were several of my colour on board -- runaway slaves -- and all good determined men .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 12]: These were the people I required , for they understood me .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 22]: Even on board of a pirate vessel , the same contempt was shown towards us -- still considered as inferior beings .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 33]: All the heavy work all the dirty work , was for the negro race ; and we often worked like slaves , while the captain and the rest of the crew caroused .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 10]: I was three years on board of this vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 20]: Our rendezvous where we are going to now , is a small land-locked bay on the island of Cuba .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 33]: No vessel in it can be seen from seaward , and there is but one narrow pass by which it communicates with the interior , and it is far from any habitation .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 13]: A better retreat for a pirate vessel could not well be found .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 34]: We used very often to go in to refit , and take in provisions and water ; for in a cave there , we keep the provisions which we take from other vessels .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 22]: `` In a desperate fight which we had with an English man-of-war brig , we lost nearly forty of our men .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 25]: The captain , Chico , as he was called , was obliged to fill up with black men , until he could procure others .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 20]: The consequence was , that with the ten before on board , there were fifty blacks to seventy whites .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 21]: It was then that I made up my mind that I would retaliate for all that my race had suffered .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 25]: I was sure of the ten with whom I had sailed so long ; I sounded the others , and found them all willing .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 18]: `` We sailed from the Mexican Gulf , and made for the Rendezvous Bay , in Cuba .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 36]: As soon as we arrived , of course , as with all pirate vessels , the first day was dedicated to revelling and intoxication -- that is , by the white portion of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 12]: We negroes were employed in getting the casks ashore for water .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 50]: That very night , when they all lay asleep and drunk , we put every soul of them to death , and the Stella belonged to me and my brave black who chose me for their captain , and swore by their wrongs eternal enmity to the European race .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 32]: `` As you may suppose , I was short-manned ; but we soon found plenty of men , and have now as fine a crew as ever trod a deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 14]: `` How long is it since you took possession of the vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 17]: `` About eight or nine months , during which time I have spared none except you .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 25]: The usual death is drowning ; but if I fall in with a slaver , then -- you know what took place yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 7]: I was silent for a time .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 26]: `` I do not wonder , '' said I , at last , `` at your hatred of the whites , especially of the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 58]: As for your wreaking your vengeance upon those employed in the slave trade , dreadful as it is , I scarcely pity them ; but in your general warfare against the whites , recollect that you may murder those who are your friends , and who have done all they can to put an end to slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 14]: Even in America , there are many who are opposed to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 14]: `` It is impossible to make a distinction , '' replied the negro .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 5]: said I , musing .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 6]: `` Why do you ask ?
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 19]: You may as well know ; I wish it to be known : it is James Vincent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 22]: `` But tell me , if you were to meet with a very superior force , what would you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 12]: `` Run if I could ; if not , fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 19]: `` But you might be captured , and then -- '' `` Never , boy ; never . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 25]: `` Well , '' said I , `` as you have begun by sparing me , I hope you will spare others now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 10]: `` I do n't know why I spared you .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 25]: Had you shown any fear of death I should not have done so ; but I felt that you would not care about it .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 7]: I believe it was that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 32]: About ten days after , we made the east end of the island of Cuba , and ran into the Bay of Rendezvous , as it was named by the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 31]: It was very small , but completely land-locked , and the land so high on every side that the masts of the vessel could not be seen from the seaward .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 67]: The bay on the land side was met by a deep , narrow ravine , between mountains which were almost perpendicular , the ravine itself being accessible from the main land by only one narrow path known to the pirates , and which they seldom made use of , except when a spy was sent to the Havannah to ascertain what vessels were about to sail .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 63]: On the high land which shut in the bay from the sea , the pirates had a man constantly on the look-out , to report any vessel which might be in the offing , and Vincent himself passed much of his time there , as the breeze was fresh and the air cool to what it was down in the land-locked bay .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 29]: I was , for the same reason , very fond of being on the look-out hill , and generally followed up the captain when he went out there .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 24]: He certainly now showed a strong affection for me , and I liked him better than I ever thought I could have done .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 52]: He was constantly telling me of the treatment he and the other poor blacks had received in America , and I could not help feeling my blood boil , and a conviction that , had I been so treated , I should probably have been equally under the influence of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 21]: It is the world , and the treatment we receive from it , which makes us chiefly what we are .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 37]: One day the captain told me he was going that evening to obtain information , as the spy he had sent had returned unsuccessful , and that he should be absent for three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 58]: Although I was not discontented with my position , still , as the reader may well suppose , I had a strong wish to be out of it as soon as possible , and I had determined to escape if I could ; it immediately occurred to me , that his absence would give me the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 17]: I replied with a laugh , `` Had you not better take me with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 44]: `` Very likely , indeed , you would be so very useful ; I shall have quite enough to do to take care of myself ; besides , you might betray me , '' added he , with a fierce and penetrating look .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 15]: `` Thank you , for your good opinion , '' replied I , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 18]: `` So you think , because you have saved my life , that I would take yours .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 18]: I am not yet such a rascal , whatever I may become by keeping bad company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 47]: `` Well , well , '' replied the negro captain , `` I believe I am wrong , so do n't get into a passion ; but , at all events , you must see that it is impossible I can take you with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 44]: `` If you do n't choose , I ca n't help it , '' said I ; `` but I do n't like remaining here without you ; I shall run away if I can , so I give you fair warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 27]: `` You wo n't find that quite so easy , '' replied he , laughing ; `` and I recommend you not to attempt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 5]: Here the conversation dropped .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 30]: About midnight the captain commenced his ascent of the ravine , and I resolved that I would not lose the opportunity , if it offered , of following him .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 44]: I watched him as long as I could see him , that I might know the direction of the secret path , and then I joined the crew , who were lying down by the tents which they had pitched on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 50]: Shortly afterwards , the Spanish Indian , who had coloured me , passed by me , and , as I intended to make the attempt before it was quite dark , I thought that I would remove any suspicion , and I therefore requested him to stain me again .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 23]: This he consented to do , and in half an hour I was again naked among the negroes and undergoing the operation .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 14]: Having received the two applications , as before , I then quitted them .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 54]: As soon as it was quite dark , I armed myself with a pair of pistols , and crawled underneath the back of the captain 's tent , in which I always slept , and , without being perceived , gained the narrow path in the brushwood by which the captain had left .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 50]: I continued in the path for some time , by feeling the brushwood on either side ; but before I had crawled half way up the ravine , I found that the brushwood had not been cut away any farther and I was at a loss how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 29]: All traces were gone , and all I had to do was to climb up to the summit , and to take my chance of finding any egress .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 31]: I toiled on with difficulty , sometimes stopped by a rock which would take me minutes to climb over at others , holding on by the brushwood for my life .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 26]: By twelve o'clock I had gained more than two-thirds of the ascent , and then the moon rose , and assisted me with her light .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 81]: I must say , that when I looked up and saw the rocks towering above me , and overhanging my path , I felt that escape was nearly impossible : however , I recommenced my labour , and gained some ground , when , as I was clinging to the side of a rock by a small shrub , it gave way , and I rolled and fell down many feet , between that rock and another opposite to it .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 12]: I was not much hurt , and I regained my legs .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 44]: Looking up and about me , I found that I was in a narrow passage , between the rocks , leading both up and down -- in fact , I had tumbled into the secret path that I had been in search of .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 44]: Delighted with this discovery , I now set off with great spirit , and in half an hour found myself on the other side of the lull which formed the ravine , and looking down upon an expanse of country in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 20]: Being very tired , I sat down , that I might recover my strength before I continued my journey .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 36]: `` I am free at last , '' thought I , and my memory wandered back to my mother my ship , and my captain -- old Culpepper , Tommy Dott , and Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 23]: `` I shall see them all , '' I thought , `` and what a story I shall have to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 20]: As soon as I had rested myself and recovered my breath , I thought I might as well start .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 23]: I had not proceeded more than a hundred yards before I thought heard a noise , as if some one was approaching .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 23]: I listened -- I felt sure that such was the case , and I also heard the deep baying of a hound .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 25]: The noise increased rapidly -- it was that of one forcing his way through the brushwood , which covered the side of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 21]: In a minute afterwards I perceived a man coming up the hill at a swift pace , directly towards me .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 52]: As he approached I could almost swear that it was Vincent , the negro captain ; but when within ten yards of me , I perceived , him turn round and flourish his sabre in the air , while , at the same time , three large bloodhounds sprang at him .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 43]: One fell by the blow of his sabre , but the other two flew at his throat , and fastened on him , tearing him to the around , and holding him in spite of all his struggling and his immense strength .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 28]: I recollected my pistols : I cocked them , ran up , and putting one to the head of the nearest dog , blew out its brains .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 21]: I was equally successful with the other -- they both lay dead by his side , and Vincent was released .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 4]: He started up .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 14]: `` It is me , Cato , '' said I. `` Cato ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 14]: replied he ; `` but there is not a moment to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: I understand it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 52]: He seized me by the arm , and dragged me with him to the narrow entrance of the pass , and as soon as we came in he rolled three large rocks , which had evidently been used for such purpose before , so as completely to block up the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 18]: `` There , '' said he , leaning back quite exhausted ; `` be quiet , Cato .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 17]: We are safe now ; they will be on the top of the hill directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 19]: We remained where we were about ten minutes , when we heard voices not very far from us .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: They were the pursuers of the negro captain who were evidently baffled .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 16]: After a time the sounds receded from us , and we heard them no more .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 13]: Vincent then spoke : -- `` You were escaping , Cato . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 18]: `` I had escaped , '' replied I : `` I told you that I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: `` Strange that you should have discovered the path ; did any one betray it to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 20]: `` No one , '' replied I : and I then told him how I had fallen into it .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 38]: `` Well you have returned all obligations , and more than ever you owed me , '' said he : `` you have saved my life this time , and that when all chance was over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 40]: `` Then , '' replied I , `` although I shall be very sorry to part with you , give me that liberty which I had gained , and which I lost in defending you from the dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 24]: `` I would have let you go then , Cato , '' replied he , `` but your life would have been sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 17]: My pursuers would have hurried you to prison before you could have explained who you were .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 26]: You forget your colour is changed ; they were not seeking me , but a runaway slave , and the bloodhounds came upon my track .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 29]: Those white men show no mercy ; they have more pleasure in seeing a runaway slave torn to pieces by those dogs than in recovering possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 22]: It is a sort of fox-chase to them , '' continued he , grating his teeth after he had said so .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 48]: `` Cato , I will give you your liberty , if you wish it , and I know you do wish it , as soon as I can with any prudence ; that I promise you , and you know that I will keep my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 27]: `` I am quite satisfied , '' replied I. `` And do you promise me that you will not attempt to escape a second time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 19]: `` I promise you that I will not , '' replied I. `` Enough , '' said Vincent .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 31]: `` Now let us go down the hill , for I am very much torn by those infernal brutes , and must have the wounds washed and attended to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 20]: We descended the hill , in silence , and in a quarter of an hour had gained the tent .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 28]: Vincent was severely bitten and torn : as soon as his wounds had been dressed he lay down on his mat , and I did the same .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 36]: It was some days before Vincent recovered from the severe injuries which he had received from the bloodhounds ; and he did not appear to be inclined to run any more risks of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 33]: Although he said little , I could perceive that he was brooding over future vengeance and he was now nearly the whole of the day with his glass on the look-out hill .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 27]: One morning a schooner hove in sight , steering from the Havannah to the southward and eastward , either for the islands of the Spanish Main .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 38]: The Stella had for many days been ready for instant sailing , and having watched her till near sunset , Vincent sent down orders for every soul to be on board , and the anchor hove up .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 17]: Just as it was dark we towed out of the bay , and made all sail .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 31]: At daylight the schooner was but a few miles ahead of us and not being a fast sailer , in little more than an flour we were alongside of her .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 36]: She proved to be bound to the island of Curacao , being the property of an old Dutch gentleman , who was on board with his daughter , a little girl about seven years old .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 41]: The crew consisted chiefly of negroes , slaves to the owner ; the master of the vessel and the mate being , with the exception of the old gentleman and the little girl , the only white people on board .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 30]: As usual , the crew were brought on board by the pirates , who reported to the captain that the vessel was in ballast , and of no value .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 52]: As the crew of the Stella were already more than requisite , Vincent did not require the negroes ; he told them that they might go on board the schooner again , and take her into any port they pleased ; with the white people , however it was another affair .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 41]: I had remained below , not wishing to witness a scene of butchery ; but I was induced to look up the ladder , in consequence of Jose telling me that there was a little white girl come on board .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 53]: At the time that I did so , Vincent had just done speaking with the negroes belonging to the captured vessel ; they had fallen back , and there was then standing before Vincent , the master and mate of the vessel , the old Dutch gentleman , and the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 21]: A more interesting child I never had seen , and my heart bled at the idea of her being sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 18]: I could not help hoping that Vincent would have a similar feeling , but I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 20]: The master and mate were pointed at , and immediately seized by negroes and tossed over into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 26]: The old gentleman bowed his head over the beautiful child , and she knelt to him , as if for his blessing before she died .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 22]: At that very moment Vincent gave the sign -- I could remain quiet to longer -- I sprang on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 18]: cried I to the men who were about to seize the old gentleman -- `` stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 9]: The negroes did fall back at my voice .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 6]: `` What is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 3]: cried Vincent .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 25]: `` Captain Vincent , '' cried I , `` do you call yourself a man , to war with children and old grey-headed men ?
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 11]: You must not , shall not , touch these two .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 18]: You have wreaked your vengeance upon the white men ; be content -- let these go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 32]: `` Cato , '' replied Vincent , fiercely , `` it is well that it is you that have dared to snatch the prey from the fangs of the wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 27]: Had it been another , this pistol should have sent a ball whizzing through his brain ; as it is , go down below immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 34]: `` I do not fear your pistol , Captain Vincent , nor will I go below ; that very pistol , in my hand , saved you from the fangs of the blood-hound .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 37]: I tell you , therefore , that you must not destroy that innocent child -- if you love me , you must not ; for I will hate , detest , and scorn you ever afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 37]: I entreat you -- I implore you to let them go : they are not fit objects for your vengeance ; and if you destroy them , I tell you , you are a coward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 9]: roared the tiger , `` a coward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 19]: and , no longer able to contain himself he levelled his pistol at me and drew the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 25]: It missed fire ; Vincent looked very confused -- he tossed the pistol on deck , folded his arms and turned his face away .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 6]: There was a dead silence .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 24]: The negro crew looked first at me and then at the captain , as if awaiting orders , and uncertain of the issue .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 36]: The Dutch gentleman seemed to be so lost in surprise , as to almost forget his impending fate ; while the little girl clung to him and stared at me with her deep blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 12]: It was what on the theatres they would call a tableau .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 6]: I followed up my advantage .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 20]: Stepping forward , and placing myself before the old man and the child , I first broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 31]: `` Captain Vincent , '' said I , `` you did once promise me that you would never injure me or attempt my life ; that promise you have broken .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 44]: Since that , you have made me another promise -- you may recollect it -- which was , that you would allow me to leave you on the first favourable opportunity ; there can not be any opportunity more favourable than the present .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 19]: The negroes whom you are to send back to the schooner do not know how to navigate her .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 26]: I request , therefore , to know whether you intend to keep this second promise , or to break it as you have the first ?
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 6]: I ask my liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 20]: `` If I broke my promise just now , it was your fault , '' replied Vincent , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 37]: `` I am sorry for it , and I can say no more ; I intended to keep it , and , to prove so , I now keep my second -- you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 7]: `` I thank you for that .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 32]: I only wish that , now I leave you , I could leave you with feelings of good-will and not of -- I must say it -- of horror and disgust .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 23]: Captain Vincent , once more let me beg , as a last favour , that you will spare these poor people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 34]: `` Since you are so particularly interested about this useless old man and still more useless child , '' replied Vincent , sarcastically , `` I will now make a proposal to you .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 5]: You have your liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 21]: Do you choose to give it up and remain here , provided I let them go away in the schooner ?
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 37]: Come now -- take your choice ; for I swear by my colour , that if you go away in the schooner , the moment you shove off , they shall go over the gunwale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 37]: `` My choice is then made , '' replied I ; for I knew that when he swore by his colour he was in earnest : `` release them , and I will remain here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 14]: I little knew what I was to undergo in consequence of this decision .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 41]: `` Be it so , '' said Vincent : then turning to one of the mates , `` let them go back with the negroes ; hoist the boat up when she returns , and sail for the Rendezvous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 10]: So saying , he went down into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 45]: `` You are saved , '' said I , going up to the old Dutch gentleman ; `` lose no time ; get into the boat as fast as possible , and make sail on your vessel as soon as you get on board .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 14]: Good bye , little girl , '' said I , taking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 54]: `` I thank you , '' replied the gentleman in good English -- `` I can not say how much ; I am so surprised at what I have seen but recollect the name of Vanderwelt , of Curacao ; and if ever we meet again , you will find me grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 26]: `` I will ; but ask no more questions now -- into the boat -- quick , '' said I , shaking his proffered hand .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 11]: They were handed down into the boat by the negroes .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 34]: I remained on deck until they were put on board ; the boat returned , was hoisted up , the schooner made sail again , and then I went down into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 34]: I found the negro captain stretched upon the sofa , his face covered up with both his hands ; he remained in the same position , taking no notice of my coming down .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 158]: Although my confidence in him was destroyed after his snapping the pistol at me , yet when I reflected how I had bearded him in his rage , I did make some excuse for him ; moreover , I knew that it was my interest to be on the best terms with him , and , if possible , make him forget what had passed , for I felt that his proud spirit would make it difficult for him to forgive himself for having been induced by his passion to break an oath which he had sworn to by his colour ; I therefore , after a little reflection , went up to him and said -- `` I am sorry that I made you so angry , Captain Vincent ; you must forgive me , but I thought that deed beneath you , and I could not bear to have a bad opinion of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 18]: `` Do you mean to assert that you have not a bad opinion of me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 9]: replied he , fixing his eyes upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 27]: `` No , certainly not ; you have released those I pleaded for , and I am very grateful to you for having done so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 27]: `` You have made me do what I never did before , '' replied he , raising himself and sitting with his feet on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 17]: `` I know I have ; I have made you spare those of my colour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 21]: `` I did not mean that ; you have irritated me so as to make me break my oath . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 13]: `` That was my own doing -- my fault rather than yours .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 24]: I had no right to speak as I did ; but I was in a great rage , and that is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 33]: I do believe that , if I had had a pistol in my hand , I should have fired it at you ; so we may cry quits on that score . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 28]: `` I am angry with myself -- the more so , that I little imagined that you would have remained with me after my breaking my oath .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 33]: Either you must have felt great interest about those people , or you must have great confidence in me , a confidence winch I have proved that I do not deserve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 58]: `` That you did forget yourself , I grant ; but I have that confidence that it will be a warning to you , and you will not forget yourself again ; I therefore remain with you with perfect confidence , feeling I am quite safe , until you think proper to give me my liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 10]: `` You will wish to leave me then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 12]: `` I have relations and friends -- a profession to follow .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 12]: What can I gain by remaining here , except your friendship ?
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 24]: I never will be a pirate , you may be assured , I wish from my heart that you were not one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 13]: `` And who should be pirates if the blacks are not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 3]: replied Vincent .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 9]: `` Have they not the curse of Cain ?
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 5]: Are they not branded ?
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 14]: Ought not their hands to be against every one but their own race ?
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 16]: What is the Arab but the pirate of the desert -- the sea of sand ?
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: Black is the colour for pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 22]: Even the white pirates feel the truth of this , or why do they hoist the _ black _ flag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 15]: `` At all events , it 's a profession that seldom ends well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 8]: `` And what matter does that make ?
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 12]: We can die but once -- I care not how soon .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 18]: I have not found life so very sweet as to care for it , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 26]: Cato , there is but one thing sweet in existence -- one feeling that never clogs and never tires , and that is revenge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 8]: `` Are not love and friendship sweet ?
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 9]: I certainly know nothing about the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 11]: `` I know no more than you do of it .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 49]: They say friendship is the more lasting ; and as a proof of how lasting that is I snapped my pistol at you , and , had it not missed fire , should have killed the only one for whom I ever felt friendship in this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 28]: `` That 's a bad habit you have of carrying your pistols at all times ; they are too handy , and give no time or reflection .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 20]: Only suppose , now , you had blown out my brains , you would have been very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 21]: `` Cato , I have many lives on my hands , and hope to have many more before I die .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 24]: I never have repented one act of my life -- a murder , as you may call it -- and I never shall .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 22]: But I tell you frankly , that had I destroyed you in my passion I should have been a miserable man .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 9]: I know it ; I feel it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 31]: `` Let 's say no more about it : that I 'm just as glad as you are that you did not kill me , I assure you most positively .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 9]: Here 's Jose coming with the dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 27]: Here ended our conversation , which I have given just to show the peculiar disposition of this extraordinary man , with whom I had become domesticated .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 39]: Verily and truly was I , as he said , `` like a little dog in the cage of a tiger , '' and , from familiarity : just as bold as dogs become under such peculiar circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 20]: Before morning we were again at anchor in the Rendezvous Bay , and the tents were pitched as before .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 22]: We remained there for more than a fortnight , during which my intimacy with the captain was even greater than before .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 21]: He appeared to endeavour to do all in his power to restore my confidence in him , and he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 18]: Still , I must say , that I began to be weary of this sort of life .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 35]: My dreams were ever of murder and bloodshed ; and more than once I felt inclined to make my escape : but I had promised , and the remembrance of my promise prevented me .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 17]: One afternoon the man on the look-out made the usual signal for a vessel in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 10]: Vincent went up immediately , and I followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 15]: It was a schooner , very long , with very taut , raking masts .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 23]: Vincent examined her for some time , and then gave me the glass , and asked me what I thought of her .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 12]: I replied , that I thought she was a man-of-war schooner .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 30]: `` You are right , '' said he , `` I know her well ; it is the Arrow , and she has come out to cruise for me .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 13]: This is the third time that she has been sent after me .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 22]: Once we exchanged a few broadsides , but another man-of-war hove in sight , and I was compelled to leave her .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 50]: She shall not accuse me of running from her , now that she is alone , and by to-morrow morning I will give her the opportunity of making the report of my capture if she can ; but if I capture her , you may guess the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 12]: We remained till nearly sunset watching the motions of the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 18]: Vincent then went down the hill to give orders for sailing , leaving me with the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 16]: I again directed it to the schooner , and perceived that she was making signals .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 22]: Then she is not alone , thought I ; and Vincent may not capture her quite so easily as he expects .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 35]: I looked in vain for the other vessel ; I could not see her ; I therefore concluded that she must be somewhere under the land , and hidden by it from my sight .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 30]: The signals were repeated till dusk when I went down the hill , and found that all was bustle and activity , Vincent superintending himself the preparations for sailing .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 17]: I did not interrupt him to tell him that I had perceived the schooner making signals .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 30]: I had an idea , somehow or another , that I should regain my liberty , and was as anxious as Vincent that the Stella should be under weigh .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 7]: Before ten o'clock everything was ready .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 39]: Vincent had told his men that the English man-of-war schooner was outside , and that he intended to fight her ; the men appeared delighted at the proposal , and as resolute and determined as men should be .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 35]: As soon as the Stella was clear of the bay , everything was got ready for action , and I must say that nothing could be more rapid or more quiet than their movements .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 25]: We stood out until we had gained an offing of five miles , and then made a reach along the shore towards the Havannah .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 18]: As soon as the Stella had laid her head towards the Havannah , Vincent came down below .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 37]: I had latterly slept on one of the cabin sofas , but had this night remained with my clothes on , for I was not sure that we might not be in action before the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 31]: The Arrow had gained the knowledge that our Rendezvous Bay was somewhere about the east end of the island , and had cruised accordingly , but could not discover it .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 50]: Vincent threw himself on the other sofa , and I pretended to asleep ; as I did not wish to enter into conversation with him was too much occupied with my own thoughts , and felt that there would be nothing in common between us at such a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: He was very soon asleep , and he talked in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 44]: He was evidently in action , and gave his orders , every now and then speaking a few words aloud , and then it appeared as if he had taken the English schooner , and that he was fulfilling his vows of retaliation .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 19]: I shuddered as I heard the half-broken menaces -- the exulting laugh which occasionally burst from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 25]: I arose and watched him as he slept ; his hands were continually in motion , and his fists clenched , and he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 3]: Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 14]: what a tale of savage cruelty that smile foretold if he were successful !
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 14]: I knelt down and prayed that he might be foiled in his endeavours .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 23]: As I rose I heard a noise and talking on deck , and one of the mates came down in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 7]: `` How does she bear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 20]: cried Vincent , starting up from his couch , as if he instinctively knew what was to be told .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 15]: `` Two points on the weather bow , captain , '' replied the negro .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 11]: `` I think she has her foresheet to windward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 7]: `` What 's the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 17]: `` One bell in the morning watch ; it will be daylight in an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 7]: How far is she off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 6]: `` About four miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 12]: `` Pipe to quarters ; I will be up directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 28]: Vincent took down his sword and buckled on his belt ; then his pistols , which after having examined the primings , he fixed in his girdle .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 22]: I still remained as if asleep , and as he was going out of the cabin , he turned to me .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: `` He sleeps , poor boy ; well , why should I wake him ?
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 11]: -- the guns will rouse him up soon enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: So saying , he went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 7]: I considered what I should do .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 24]: To be on deck was hardly safe for me as a white person ; and , indeed , what business had I there ?
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 27]: Why should I expose myself to the shot of my countrymen , or run the risk of losing my life from the rage of the negroes ?
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 17]: I therefore resolved on remaining where I was -- at all events , for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 18]: The negroes now came into the cabin , for the after-magazine was under the forepart of it .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 16]: The hatch was taken up , the screens let down , and all was dark .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 30]: I had nothing to do but to catch now and then the commands given by the negro captain , and draw my inference as to what was taking place .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 22]: Although for the first half-hour I gained little information , after that time had elapsed I knew what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 20]: I heard a voice hailing us from another vessel , and the reply of the Stella was a broadside .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 8]: There could be no mistake in that .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 19]: The Stella was then put about , and the other broadside given without a return from her opponent .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 27]: At last it came , and as the shot whizzed over or tore up the planking of the gunwales , I certainly did feel very strangely .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 45]: I had never been in action before , and the sensation was , I confess , that of alarm ; but it was so mingled with curiosity as to what was going on , that it was impossible to say what my feelings were .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 46]: I longed to be on deck , and certainly would have been , if I had thought that I was safe with the pirate crew : that alone prevented me ; I remained , therefore , in a most unpleasant state of ignorance and suspense .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 25]: The broadsides were now exchanged rapidly and the wounded , brought down between decks every minute , told me that the action was severe .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 16]: The orders of the negro captain were occasionally heard -- they were cool and determined .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 23]: Every minute some fresh manoeuvre was executed , and the guns still worked as if there was nothing else to attend to .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 36]: At last , the daylight came down the hatchway , and I left the cabin and walked forward between decks ; I found the deck strewed with wounded and dying men , calling for water .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 75]: I was glad to be able to do something which I could consistently do , and I brought water from the cask and gave it to them , one after another , as fast as I could ; I think there were at least thirty men lying about the lower deck , some in pools of their own blood , and sinking fast , for there was no surgeon on board of the Stella .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 99]: Some more wounded men were brought down , and a conversation took place between one of the mates of the schooner , who was hurt , and the men who brought down the wounded , and listening to them , I found that at daylight they had discovered that an English frigate was under all sail , beating up to them , and about five miles to leeward ; that in consequence , the Stella was now carrying on a running fight with the schooner -LRB- who was to windward of her -RRB- , and trying to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 19]: This accounted for the signals which I had perceived that the English schooner was making the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: My anxiety at this intelligence was naturally much increased .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 23]: The Stella was trying to escape , and her sailing powers were so remarkable , that I was afraid she would succeed .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 66]: The action was still continued between the two schooners , but now the shot no longer hit the Stella , nor were there any more wounded men brought down ; it was evident that the two vessels were now firing at each other 's masts and rigging , the one to prevent , and the other to effect her escape , by dismantling her antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 17]: I felt as if I could have given my left hand to have gone on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 23]: I waited half an hour more , and then , curiosity conquering my fear , I crept gradually up the fore ladder .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 39]: The men were working the guns to windward , the lee-side of the deck was clear , and I stepped forward , and got into the head , where I could see both to windward and to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 53]: To leeward I perceived the frigate about four miles distant with every stretch of canvass that she could set on a wind ; I knew her directly to be the Calliope , my own ship , and my heart beat quick at the chance of being once more on board of her .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 81]: To windward , as the smoke occasionally cleared away , I saw the Arrow schooner close hauled on the same tack as the Stella , and distant about a mile , every ten seconds the smoke from her guns booming along the water 's surface , and the shot whizzing through our rigging ; she had not suffered much from our fire : her sails were full of shot-holes , it is true , but her spars were not injured .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 40]: I then turned my eyes upon the masts and rigging of the Stella : apparently , the damage done was about equal to that received by the Arrow ; our sails were torn , but our spars were unscathed .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 43]: The water was smooth , although the breeze was fresh , and both schooners were running at the rate of six or seven miles an hour ; but the Stella had evidently the advantage of sailing , and fore-reached upon her opponent .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 24]: I perceived that everything depended upon a lucky hit and having satisfied myself with what I had seen , I hastened down below .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 42]: For more than half an hour the firing continued without advantage on either side , when a yell was given by the negro crew , and I heard them cry on the deck that the Arrow 's foretop-mast was shot away .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 20]: I heard the voice of Vincent cheering his men , and telling them to be steady in their aim .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 15]: My heart sunk at the intelligence , and I sat down on a chest .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 28]: The firing now slackened , for the Stella had shot ahead of the English schooner , and the negroes on deck were laughing and in high good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 52]: For a few minutes the firing ceased altogether , and I took it for granted that the Stella had left her pursuers far behind ; when of a sudden , a whole broadside of guns were poured into us , and there was a terrible crashing and confusion on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: I ran up the ladder to see what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 50]: It appeared that as the Stella was crossing the bows of the Arrow , the latter had , as a last chance thrown up in the wind , and discharged her whole broadside into us : two shots had struck our mainmast , which had fallen by the board .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 29]: I perceived at once that the Stella 's chance was over -- nothing could save her ; she might resist the schooner but could not escape the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 25]: I ran down below , and went into the cabin ; I was afraid that the negroes might perceive the joy in my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 29]: I heard the angry voice of the negro captain -- I heard him stamping with rage , and I thanked God that I was not by his side .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 41]: The wreck of the mast was soon cleared away ; I heard him address his negroes , point out to them that it was better to die like men at the guns , than swing at the yard-arm like dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 21]: Some of them came down and took on deck a quarter-cask of spirits , which was plentifully supplied to all .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 17]: The English schooner had borne down upon us , and the action now commenced at pistol-shot .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 71]: Never shall I forget what took place for nearly three-quarters of an hour ; the negroes , most of them intoxicated , fought with rage and fury indescribable -- their shouts -- their screams -- their cursing and blasphemy , mingled with the loud report of the guns , the crashing of the spars and bulwarks , the occasional cry of the wounded , and the powerful voice of Vincent .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 32]: It was terrific between decks ; the smoke was so thick , that those who came down for the powder could not see , but felt their way to the screen .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 36]: Every two seconds , I heard the men come aft , toss off the can of liquor , and throw it on the deck , hen they went to resume their labour at their guns .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 88]: At the end of the time I have mentioned , the shot flew from to leeward , as well as from to windward : the frigate had got within range , and was pouring in her broadside ; still the firing and the shouting on the deck of the Stella continued , but the voices were fewer ; and as the firing of the frigate became more severe , they became fainter and fainter ; and at last but an occasional gun was fired from our decks .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 39]: I became so uneasy , that I could remain where I was no longer ; I went forward on the lower deck again , and tumbling over the wounded and the dead , I crept up the fore-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 24]: I looked over the coamings of the hatchway ; the decks were clear of smoke , for not a gun was being fired .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 3]: Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 6]: what a scene of slaughter !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 67]: Many of the guns were dismantled , and the decks were strewed with the splinters and plankings of the gunwale , broken spars , and negroes lying dead , or drunk , in all directions -- some cut and torn to pieces , others whole , but mixed up with the fragments of other bodies : such a scene of blood I have never since witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 40]: Out of the whole crew , I do not think there were twenty men left unhurt , and these were leaning or lying down , exhausted with fatigue or overcome with liquor , on various parts of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 45]: The fighting was over ; there was not one man at his gun -- and of those who remained still alive , one or two fell , while I was looking up from the shot , which continued every minute to pierce the bulwarks .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 4]: Where was Vincent ?
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 8]: I dare not go aft to see .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: I dare not venture to meet his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 31]: I dived down below again , and I returned aft to the cabin ; there was no more demand for powder ; not a soul was to be seen abaft .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 26]: Suddenly the after-hatchway grating was thrown off ; I heard some one descend ; I knew it was the hurried tread of the negro captain .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 32]: It was so dark , and the cabin so full of smoke , that , coming from the light , he did not perceive me , although I could distinguish him .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 48]: He was evidently badly wounded , and tottered in his walk : he came into the cabin , put his hand to his girdle , and felt for his pistol , and then he commenced pulling down the screen , which was between him and the magazine .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 13]: His intentions were evident ; which were to blow up the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 11]: I felt that I had not a moment to lose .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 25]: I dashed past him , ran up the ladder , sprung aft to the taffrail , and dashed over the stern into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 59]: I was still beneath the surface , having not yet risen from my plunge , when I heard and felt the explosion -- felt it , indeed , so powerfully , that it almost took away my senses ; so great was the shock , even when I was under the water , that I was almost insensible .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 36]: I have a faint recollection of being drawn down by the vortex of the sinking vessel , and scrambling my way to the surface of the water , amidst fragments of timbers and whirling bodies .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 44]: When I recovered myself , I found that I was clinging to a portion of the wreck , in a sort of patch , as it were , upon the deep blue water , dark as ink , and strewed with splintered fragments .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 59]: There I remained some minutes , during which time I gained my recollection : I looked around and perceived the Arrow schooner , lying about one hundred yards off , totally dismantled , and my own frigate about a quarter of a mile to leeward , as bright and as fresh as if she had just been refitted .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 17]: I observed a signal , made by the Calliope to the schooner , which was answered .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 16]: I looked in vain towards the schooner , expecting her to lower down a boat .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 31]: The fact was , that the Calliope had made the signal for her to do so , and the schooner had replied that she had no boat that could swim .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 24]: I then perceived that the frigate had lowered down a boat which was pulling towards me , and I considered myself as safe .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 34]: In a few minutes , during which I had quite recovered myself , the boat pulled into the mass of floating fragments , and then the sailors ceased rowing to look about them .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 24]: They perceived and pulled towards me -- hoisted me in over the gunwale , and laid me at the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 42]: I scrambled on my feet , and would have gone _ aft _ , when the midshipman of the boat said to the men , `` Pass that cursed young pirate forward -- do n't let him come aft here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 27]: `` Oh , oh , Mr Lascelles , '' thinks I -- `` so you do n't know me ; you shall know me by-and-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 33]: I quite forgot that I was stained black , till one of the men who seized me by the collar to pass me forward , said , `` Hand along the nigger .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 13]: He 's a young one for the gallows , any how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 16]: They handed me forward , and I did not choose to say who I was .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 15]: My love of fun returned the moment that I was again with my shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 30]: After looking well round and ascertaining that I was the only one left alive , they pulled back to the frigate ; and the midshipman went up to report .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 71]: I was handed up the side and remained at the break of the gangway , while the captain and first lieutenant were talking with Mr Lascelles : during which Mr Tommy Dott came up to me , and , putting his finger to his left ear , gave a cluck with his tongue , as much as to say , `` You 'll be hanged , my good fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 57]: I could not help giving the first mason 's sign which I taught to Mr Green in return for Tommy 's communication ; to wit , putting my thumb to my nose , and extending my finger out towards him ; at which Tommy Dott expressed much indignation , and called me a precious impudent varmin .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 18]: The men who were near us laughed , and said that I was game at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 38]: No one knew me ; for not only was my face well stained , but I was covered from head to foot with a solution of salt water and gunpowder , which made me still more indistinguishable .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 23]: I had remained at the gangway about two minutes , when the first lieutenant said , `` Bring the prisoner here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 86]: I immediately went aft ; and as soon as I was standing before Captain Delmar and the first lieutenant -- -LRB- and behind were all the officers , anxious to hear what I had to disclose -RRB- -- I put my hand to my head , having no hat , as may be supposed , and said , '' _ Come on board , sir _ , '' reporting myself , as is usually the custom of officers when they return from leave or duty .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: `` Good Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 3]: that voice !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: -- why , who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 9]: cried Captain Delmar , starting back a pace .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 18]: `` Mr Keene , sir , '' replied I , again putting my hand to my head .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 47]: Bob Cross , who was , with many of the seamen , close to me , quite forgetting etiquette , ran up and caught me round the waist , looking me full in the face : `` It is him , sir -- it is him !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 2]: Huzzah !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 3]: huzzah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 22]: and all the seamen joined in the huzzahs , which were , however , mingled with a great deal of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 4]: `` Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 25]: and so you have been blown up in that vessel , '' said the first lieutenant , coming to me , with great kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 6]: `` Are you much burnt ?
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 13]: Why , he 's quite black -- where 's the surgeon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 44]: `` Are n't hurt at all , sir , '' replied I. `` Let him be taken down and examined , '' said the captain with some emotion ; `` if not hurt , let him come into the cabin to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 36]: The captain went down the ladder , and then I shook hands with Tommy Dott and all the other officers and midshipmen ; and I will say that my re-appearance appeared to give unusual satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 10]: I went down into the gun-room and was stripped .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 34]: They were much surprised to find that I was not hurt , and even more when they discovered that I was black all over , and that washing would not restore my colour .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 23]: `` Why , Keene , '' said the first lieutenant , `` how is it that you have changed your colour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 17]: `` Oh , sir , I 've been playing the nigger for these last three months .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 24]: It is a long story , but I will go with you to the captain , and I will tell it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 47]: As soon as I had put on my uniform , I went up with Mr Hippesley to the cabin , and having , at the captain 's request , taken a chair , I entered into a full explanation , which lasted more than an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 42]: As soon as I had finished , Mr Hippesley who had plenty to do on deck , but who could not leave until he had heard my story , quitted the cabin , and I found myself alone with the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 42]: `` I must say that I gave you up for lost , '' said Captain Delmar ; `` the boat 's crew were picked up the next morning , and reported that you were drowned in the cabin of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 10]: Scoundrels , to desert you in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 30]: `` I do not think they were to blame , sir ; the water being so high in the cabin , and my not answering to their call . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 8]: `` But did they call you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 22]: `` Yes , sir ; I heard them call when I was half asleep , and I did not answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 33]: `` Well , I am glad to hear you say so ; but so convinced have we been of your loss , that I have written to your mother on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 16]: Strange , this is the second time that she has been distressed in this way .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 12]: You appear to have a charmed life , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 43]: `` I hope I shall long live to do credit to your protection , sir , '' replied I. `` I hope so too , Mr Keene , '' replied the captain , very kindly ; `` I sincerely hope so too .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 11]: In all this business you have conducted yourself very manfully .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 17]: It does you great credit , and your mother ought to be proud of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 42]: `` Thanky , sir , '' replied I , for I was overjoyed at such language from Captain Delmar , and I thought to myself , if he says my mother ought be proud of me , he feels so himself .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 31]: `` Of course , you can not do duty under such a masquerade as you are at present , '' continued the captain , who referred to my stained skin .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 9]: `` I presume it will wear off by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 16]: You will dine with me to-day ; now you may go to your messmates . ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 16]: I left the cabin , bowing very respectfully , and pleased with what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 34]: I hastened to join my messmates , not , however , until I had shaken hands with Bob Cross , who appeared as delighted to see me as if he was my father .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 20]: I leave the reader to imagine the sort of levee which I held both on the quarter-deck and below .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 14]: Mr Hippesley could not get any of the officers to mind their duty .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 15]: I certainly was for two or three days the greatest personage in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 18]: After that , I had time to tell the whole of my history quietly to Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 59]: Bob Cross , when he had heard me without interruption , said , `` Well , Master Keene , there 's no telling what a man 's born to till after he 's dead , and then it 's all known : but it does appear to me that you are born to something out of the common .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 20]: Here you are , not sixteen , not only playing a man 's part , but playing it manfully .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 20]: You have been put in most difficult situations , and always have fallen upon your feet in the end .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 36]: You appear to have an old head upon very young shoulders ; at one moment to be a scampish boy full of mischief , and at another a resolute , cool , and clever man .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 73]: Sarcumstances , they say , make men , and so it appears in you ; but it does seem strange for one and the same lad to be stealing the purser 's plums at one moment , and twisting a devil of a nigger pirate round his finger the very next ; and then you have had such escapes -- twice reported dead at head-quarters , and twice come to life again .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 105]: Now Master Keene , I 've very good news to tell you : you do n't know how high you stand with the captain and officers : there 's a feeling of envy against a lad who goes ahead -LRB- as well as a man -RRB- which blinds people to his real merits ; but when he is supposed to be dead and gone , and no longer in the way of others , then every one tells the real truth ; and I do assure you that not only the officers , but the captain himself , grieved most sorely at your loss .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 40]: I saw the captain 's eyes wink more than once when speaking of you , and the first lieutenant was always telling the other mids that he had not one worth his salt , now that you were gone .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 29]: And now that you have come back and gained so much credit for what has passed , I do really think that the captain is proud of you .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 75]: I overheard a little conversation between the captain and first lieutenant the day you came on board , after you had been in the cabin telling your adventures , and all that I can say is , that the game is in your own hands , if you only play your cards well , and never let Captain Delmar have the least idea that you know that you have such claims upon him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 22]: `` That I certainly will not , '' replied I , `` as it might check his feeling towards me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 77]: `` Exactly : I 've often thought about you , and now that I like you so much , I watch the captain for your sake , and listen particularly to what he says after dinner especially , when I 've the opportunity ; for you see , when gentlemen drink wine , they speak more freely as to what they really think , just as we foremast-men do when we get our grog on board .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 32]: The greatest misfortune which could happen to you in your position would be , the captain marrying and having children on the right side of the blanket as they call it .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 34]: Now I 've often heard the captain express a dislike to matrimony , and laugh at people 's getting married , which has pleased me very much for your sake , Master Percival .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 26]: You see , a man do n't think much of marrying after forty , and the captain must be fifty , if not more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 57]: `` Yes : but if his brother dies -- and he is a very infirm man -- the captain will then be Viscount de Versely , and inherit very large estates , and then he will marry to have an heir to the title and estates even if there is no love in the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 43]: `` So he may , '' replied Cross -- `` there 's no saying ; but still , even if he does , it ai n't certain that he has a family ; chickens must not be counted before they are hatched .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 45]: All you have to pray for then is , that the brother may prove as tough as our old admirals , whose senses get tired of staying any longer in their bodies , and leave them long before their hulks are worn out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 9]: `` Why do admirals live so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 58]: `` Well , I suppose it is for the same reason that salt meat keeps so much longer than fresh ; they have been forty or fifty years with the salt spray washing in their faces and wetting their jackets , and so in time , d'ye see , they become as it were pickled with brine .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 18]: Talking about that , how long will it be before you get that tanning off you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 32]: `` I do n't know ; but as the captain says I 'm to do no duty while it lasts , I hope it wo n't wear off too soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 28]: `` Spoken like a midshipman : now take my advice , although not ordered to your duty , come up on deck and take your spy-glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 8]: `` I 've lost it , unfortunately .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 13]: That was a good glass , for it saved my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 25]: `` Yes , it turned out as good for you as a Freemason 's sign , which is more than Mr Green can say .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 31]: I do n't think he 'll ever make a sailor -- he 'd better bear up for clerk , and then he might do very well for a purser by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 19]: There 's eight bells , Master Keene , so I think we had better say good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 73]: The Arrow schooner had suffered very severely in the contest , having lost her commanding officer and thirteen men killed and wounded : indeed , had not the Calliope been at hand , it was the general opinion that the Stella would have overpowered her , notwithstanding that the latter had lost her mainmast , for the Arrow was completely dismantled , and would not have been able to have made sail .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 37]: The Calliope sent her carpenters and best seamen on board to repair her damages , and the next day we stood away for Port Royal , Jamaica , to announce the destruction of the pirate vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 9]: In the morning Captain Delmar sent for me .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 37]: `` Mr Keene , as you can not do duty for the present , and as I do not wish you to be idle , I think you had better pay a little attention to navigation .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 26]: You send in your day 's work , I perceive , but I suppose you have never regularly gone through a course of study . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 29]: `` No , sir , '' replied I ; `` I fudge my day 's work , and I should be very glad to learn navigation properly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 5]: `` So I presume .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 25]: Well , then , I have spoken with Mr Smith , the master , who has promised me to give you the necessary instruction .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 25]: You will commence to-morrow ; you can sit at the table in the fore-cabin , where you will have nothing to distract your attention .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: You may go now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 25]: I bowed and left the cabin , and meeting Bob Cross on the main deck , I told him what the captain had said .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 24]: `` I 'm glad of it , Master Keene ; it shows that the captain does now take a strong interest in you .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 14]: He has never taken any trouble of that kind with any midshipman before .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 28]: It will be of great service to you , so pay attention ; it will please the captain if the master gives a good report of you .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 23]: Who knows but you may be sent away in a prize , and I sent with you to take care of you ?
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 9]: Would n't that be a capital spree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 75]: The next day I commenced accordingly , under the tuition of the master , and as I had not Tommy Dott to play with , I gave satisfaction , and continued to do so until our arrival at Port Royal , when the captain went up to the admiral 's , stating all the particulars of the action , and , by way of sequel , my adventures on board of the pirate vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 24]: The admiral was so much interested that he requested Captain Delmar to bring me on shore to dine with me the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 16]: I was still very black ; but that made me , I presume more interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 56]: I told my story over again , and it afforded great amusement to the company ; particularly to the ladies ; and I have reason to believe that many compliments were paid me behind my back , by the admiral and officers who dined there ; at all events , Captain Delmar was much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 7]: My strange history soon got wind .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 13]: The governor heard of it , and asked Captain Delmar about it .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 35]: The consequence was , that I received another invitation from the governor , and Captain Delmar again informed me that I might tell my own story , which I did , modestly as before .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 35]: I say modestly , for I never was a boaster at any time ; and I really believe that I thought much less of the circumstances than those did to whom I narrated them .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 21]: I had at that time but one wish , which was to find favour in the sight of Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 35]: I felt that all my prospects in life depended upon that ; and aware of his disposition , and the deference that he expected , humility had become , as it were , habitual .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 98]: During the time that we remained at Port Royal I continued my studies in the cabin and as the captain remained almost altogether on shore , I found the run of the cabin very pleasant ; but as I had no inclination to study the whole of the day , I was not sorry that Tommy Dott was very often my companion in the cabin , an entrance to which , as he could not pass the sentry at the door , he obtained by climbing down the mizen chains , and creeping into the port windows .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 34]: As soon as the captain 's boat was seen coming off Tommy was out again by the port as quick as a monkey , and I was very studiously poring over right-angled triangles .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 13]: I rose , of course , as the captain entered the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 34]: `` Sit down , Mr Keene , '' he would say -- `` sit down ; the master has reported favourably of you , and I am glad to hear of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 74]: One morning , when , as usual , Tommy Dott had come through the port , we were so busily employed with a caricature which we were making of old Culpepper , that the captain 's boat came alongside without our being aware of it , and the captain 's voice speaking to the first lieutenant as he was descending the after-ladder was the first intimation we received of his being on board .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 16]: It was impossible for Tommy Dott to escape without being seen as he climbed out .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 104]: The table which was in the centre of the cabin was covered with a blue cloth , large enough for the table when all the additional leaves were put to it , and in its present reduced size the cloth fell down to the deck ; I pointed it out to Tommy , as the sentry 's hand upon the handle of the door announced the immediate entrance of the captain , and he darted underneath the table , that he might escape detection intending as soon as the captain went into the after-cabin to make his retreat by the cabin-door or windows .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 15]: The captain entered , and I rose , as usual , from my chair .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 34]: `` Mr Keene , '' said he , `` I have occasion to speak to the first lieutenant on important private business ; oblige me by leaving the cabin till that is done .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 15]: You may as well tell Mr Hippesley that I wish to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 17]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I making a bow , and leaving the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 47]: I felt very much alarmed lest Tommy should be discovered in his hiding-place ; and after the captain had stated that he had particular business with the first lieutenant , it was my duty , knowing that Mr Dott was there , to have said so .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 12]: I hardly knew what to do , or how to act .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 12]: After all , it was no great crime as it stood .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 79]: Tommy Dott had come into the cabin without leave , and had concealed himself ; but if I was to allow Tommy to remain there and listen to important and particular business , evidently of a secret nature , I should forfeit the good opinion and confidence of the captain : nevertheless , I was very unwilling to betray him ; I was dreadfully puzzled , and when I went to the first lieutenant he perceived my confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 13]: `` Why , what is the matter with you , Mr Keene ?
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 10]: -- you look quite frightened , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 28]: `` Well , sir , I am , '' replied I ; `` and I think it my duty to tell you why I am so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 26]: I then informed him that Tommy Dott was under the cabin-table , and would , of course , hear the secret communications of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 35]: `` You have done very right , Mr Keene , and I know how unpleasant it is to you to inform against your messmate ; but at present there is no harm done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 37]: He then laughed , and said , `` However , Mr Dott shall never know that you have said anything about it , and I will frighten him out of the cabin for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 12]: He then went down the ladder , and into the fore-cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 20]: I expected that he would have discovered Tommy as if by accident , but such was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 37]: The captain had just gone into the after-cabin , and Mr Hippesley immediately followed him , and shutting the door , informed him of Mr Dott 's position , and why I had made it known .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 18]: The captain could not help laughing , as , after all , it was no great offence .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 45]: He then gave the necessary information to the first lieutenant , and they both walked into the fore-cabin ; the first lieutenant saying , `` If you please , then , Captain Delmar , I will send a boat immediately with the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 25]: `` Certainly , '' replied the captain , sitting down , and who evidently was inclined to join in the joke with Mr Hippesley .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 23]: `` Sentry , send the officer on deck to man the jolly-boat , and tell Mr Dott to come here immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 42]: I was on deck when the sentry put his head up the ladder and gave the order , and I immediately perceived the plan of the first lieutenant and the state of alarm in which Tommy Dott must have been put .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 25]: The jolly-boat was manned , and Mr Dott called for in every quarter of the ship , but he did not make his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 36]: After a delay of several minutes , the officer on deck went down into the cabin , reporting that the jolly-boat had been manned some time but that Mr Dott was not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 7]: `` Not to be found ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 15]: replied the captain ; `` why , he ca n't have fallen overboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 31]: `` Not he , sir , '' replied the first lieutenant ; `` he has gone to sleep somewhere : either in the tops or the fore-topmast staysail netting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 15]: `` He appears to be a very troublesome boy , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 14]: `` Very useless , indeed , sir , '' replied the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 10]: `` Sentry , have they found Mr Dott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 10]: `` No , sir ; quarter-masters have been everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 8]: He 's not in the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 5]: `` Very odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 4]: observed the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 38]: he 'll turn up soon , sir ; but really , Captain Delmar , if you were to give him two or three dozen at the cabin gun , it would bring him to his senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 53]: `` That I most certainly will do , '' replied Captain Delmar ; `` and I authorise you to do it , Mr Hippesley , as soon as he makes his appearance ; it will be of some service to him ; but I hope no accident has happened to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 56]: `` I have no fear of that , sir , '' replied the first lieutenant : `` if the purser 's steward 's room had been open to-day , I should have sent to see if he was not locked up in another attempt to steal raisins , but that has not been the case .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 28]: By-the-by , the spirit-room was open this morning , and he may have been down there , and may have had the hatches put over him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 18]: `` Well , we must send another midshipman ; call Mr Keene , '' said Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 11]: The sentry called me , and I made my appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 31]: `` Mr Keene , you 'll go on shore to the dockyard in the jolly-boat : give that letter to the master attendant , and wait for an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I. `` Have you seen anything of Mr Dott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 12]: said the first lieutenant ; `` you are constantly together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 23]: `` I saw him just before Captain Delmar came on board , sir , but I have not seen him since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 34]: `` Well , well , we will settle accounts with the young gentleman as soon as he turns up , '' replied the captain : `` you may go , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 16]: I perceived that the captain and first lieutenant both smiled as I left the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 59]: It appeared that soon after they left it and the captain went on shore ; but Tommy was so frightened that he remained in his hiding-place , as he made sure he would be flogged if he made his appearance , and he resolved to remain where he was until my return , that he might consult me .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 42]: As soon as I had reported myself , and given the answer to the first lieutenant , I hastened to the cabin , and then poor Tommy crawled from under the table ; the tears were still wet on his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 15]: `` I shall be flogged , Keene , as sure as I stand here .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 14]: Tell me , what can I do -- what can I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 26]: `` Tell the truth ; that 's the best way , '' replied I. `` Tell the captain that I was hid under the table !
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 6]: that would never do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 52]: `` Depend upon it , it 's the best plan , '' replied I ; `` and it is the only advice I can give you : you may be flogged if you tell the truth , but you are _ sure _ to be flogged if you tell a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: It will only add to your offence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 79]: `` Well , I 've been thinking about it -- I 'm sure that Mr Hippesley will flog me if he catches me to-day or to-morrow ; but if I remain hid for a day or two , they will really think that I have fallen overboard , and then they will say , ` poor Tommy Dott , ' and perhaps be so glad when I do make my appearance , that they will forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 31]: `` Yes , '' replied I , delighted at the idea ; `` I 'm sure they will , if you do tell the truth when you appear again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 10]: `` Then , that is what I 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 12]: The first lieutenant said that I might be in the spirit-room .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 7]: Where shall I go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 48]: `` Why , '' said I , `` you must remain under the table till dark , and then you may easily slip down into the coal-hole , where it is so dark that they never will see you , even if they go down for coals .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 34]: It is the only place I know of ; stay there all to-morrow and next day , and come up in the evening ; or the next morning perhaps will be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 33]: `` Well , it 's a very good place , '' replied Tommy ; `` anything better than being flogged ; but will you bring me something to eat and drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 23]: `` Depend upon me , Tommy , '' replied I ; `` I 'll contrive to bring you something every night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 14]: `` Well , then , I 'll do that , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 42]: `` Yes ; and tell the truth when you come out , '' said I. `` Yes , upon my honour I will ; '' and so saying , Tommy , hearing a noise , again dived under the cabin table .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 9]: Soon afterwards I went out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 27]: The first lieutenant beckoned me to him , and asked me where Mr Dott was , and I told him what had been arranged between us .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 69]: He laughed very much , and said -- `` Well , if Master Tommy punishes himself by two days ' confinement in the coal-hole , and tells the truth when he comes out , I think I may promise he will get off his flogging ; but do n't you say that I have spoken to you about it , and let him do as he proposes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 20]: When it was dark , I supplied Tommy with provisions , and he gained the coal-hole without being discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 47]: The next day the speculations at his disappearance were general , and it was now believed that poor Tommy had fallen overboard , and , as the sharks are thick enough in Port Royal , that he was safely stowed away in one of their maws .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 38]: I will say that the whole of the ship 's company were very sorry for him , with the exception of Mr Culpepper , who observed that no good ever came of a boy who stole raisins .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 33]: `` So you think , that because a lad steals a few of your confounded plums , '' observed the second lieutenant , `` he deserves to be eaten by the sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 15]: If I were Tommy Dott , I would haunt you if I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 21]: `` I 'm not afraid of dead men , '' replied Mr Culpepper ; `` they are quiet enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 33]: `` Perhaps so ; but recollect , you make them chew tobacco , and therefore they ought to rise up in judgment against you , if they do against any one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 16]: As this conversation passed on the quarter-deck , it put an idea in my head .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 18]: That night I went to Tommy , whom I found terribly tired of sitting on the coals .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 16]: I brought him a bottle of mixed grog , and some boiled beef and biscuit .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 32]: I consoled him by telling him that every one was sorry at his disappearance , and that I was convinced that he would not be punished if he told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 53]: Tommy was for leaving the coal-hole immediately , but I pointed out to him that the captain had not been on board that a and that it was necessary that the captain should believe that he had fallen overboard as well as the officers , or his compassion would not be roused .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: Tommy saw the propriety of this , and consented to remain another day .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 36]: I then told him what Mr Culpepper had said , and I added , `` Now , Tommy , if Mr Culpepper should see you by any chance , pretend to be your ghost . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 19]: `` That I will , '' replied Tommy , `` if I get six dozen for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 5]: I then left him .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 47]: On my return on deck , I saw Bob Cross ; he was on shore during the major portion of the day , attending upon the captain , and as I was no longer in the captain 's gig , I saw but little of him .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 35]: `` Well , Mr Keene , '' said he , `` I think you have quite recovered your colour by this time , and I hope to see you in the gig again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 44]: `` I do not think I shall yet awhile -- I have not yet learnt navigation enough ; but the master says he will be done with me in a fortnight , if I go on as well as I do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 64]: `` Yes ; I heard him tell the captain that you were very quick , and would be a good navigator but I ca n't get over the loss of poor Tommy Dott ; he was a little scampish , that 's sartin , but still he was a merry , kind-hearted boy -- too good for the sharks , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 16]: You must feel his loss , Mr Keene , for you were always together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 36]: `` No , I do n't , Bob , '' replied I. `` Well , I 'm sorry to hear you say that , Mr Keene ; I thought you had a kinder heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 42]: `` So I have , Bob ; but I 'll tell you a secret , known only to the first lieutenant and me ; and that is , Tommy 's in the coal-hole , very dirty , but quite safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 14]: Bob Cross burst into a fit of laughing , which lasted some time .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 23]: `` Well , Mr Keene , you have really taken a weight off my mind ; now tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 7]: You know I 'm safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 26]: I then told Bob what had happened , and of Tommy 's intention to make his appearance on the following evening or the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 48]: `` Well , '' said Bob , `` you 're mischief itself , Master Keene , and that 's a fact ; however , it 's all right this time , and you have the captain and first lieutenant as your confidants and partners in the joke .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 36]: You did perfectly right and I 'm sure the captain and first lieutenant must be pleased with you ; but recollect , Master Keene , keep your distance as before ; do n't presume . ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 27]: `` Never fear , Bob , '' replied I : `` but now I have told you that , I want you to assist me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 13]: I then repeated the conversation of Mr Culpepper with the second lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 54]: `` Now , '' continued I ; `` you see , Cross , I ca n't do anything myself ; Mr Culpepper hates me , and would suspect me ; but if we could only frighten him : you might , for he would not think you were playing him a trick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 27]: `` I see , '' replied Bob ; `` it will be a good thing for Tommy Dott , and a nice wind-up of this affair .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 4]: Let me alone .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 16]: When I come on board to-morrow evening I 'll manage it if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 12]: After a little more conversation , we separated for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 9]: The next morning the captain came on board .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 27]: He remained on deck with the first lieutenant for some minutes , during which of course , he was made acquainted with Tommy Dott 's position .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 37]: When he came down into the cabin , I moved from my seat , as respectful and serious as before ; and when ordered to sit down again , resumed my studies with great apparent diligence .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 30]: He did not say a word to me about Tommy Dott ; and as he was going out of the cabin , Mr Culpepper was announced by the sentry .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 37]: `` If you please , Captain Delmar , '' said Mr Culpepper , with his usual profound bow , `` what are we to do with the effects of Mr Dott , who has fallen overboard ?
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 15]: By the regulations of the service , they should be sold before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 30]: And I also wish to know whether he is to be continued to be victualled , or whether it is your pleasure that he is discharged as dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 22]: The captain smiled , and turned his face towards me ; but I continued with my eyes down on my book .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 37]: `` Perhaps we had better wait till to-morrow , Mr Culpepper , '' replied the captain , `` and then you may sell his effects , and put DD to his name , poor fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 14]: And having made this reply , the captain went out of his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 14]: Mr Culpepper followed ; and shortly afterwards the captain went on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 39]: Before dusk , the captain 's gig , as usual , returned on board , and I was at the gangway to meet Bob Cross ; the boat was hoisted up , and then Bob came to me .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 23]: `` I must first go down and see Mr Dott , that I may be able to swear to the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 10]: Bob did so , and then returned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 17]: Mr Culpepper was abaft , walking by himself , when Bob went up and accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 38]: `` If you please , sir , '' said Bob , touching his hat , `` did the captain say anything to you about coals , for I expect we shall not stay here much longer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: `` No , '' replied Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 13]: `` Then he must have forgot it , I suppose sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 14]: `` Well , there 's plenty of coals , '' replied Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 29]: `` Well , sir , I do n't know ; but I think I heard the cook 's mate say as how they were getting rather low . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 5]: `` Getting rather low !
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 21]: then there must have been great waste , '' exclaimed Mr C , who was very careful of his expenses .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 48]: `` I do n't know how far it may be so ; but I think it might be as well to know how matters stand ; and if so be there 's plenty , why I can tell Captain Delmar when I go on shore to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 17]: `` I 'll see ; I 'll go down myself to-night , '' replied Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 21]: `` The midshipmen are allowed a stove to themselves -- very unusual -- and they are cooking all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 54]: `` Talking about midshipmen , sir , '' replied Cross , `` you may think it 's very odd but as I stand here -- and you know , Mr Culpepper , I am not easily scared -- I saw that young Tommy Dott , or his ghost , this very evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 24]: It was now quite dark ; and Mr Culpepper stared at the coxswain , and then replied , `` Pooh , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 11]: `` It 's no nonsense , I do assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 14]: I saw him with these eyes , sure as I stand here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 9]: exclaimed Mr C. `` Right forward , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 43]: I only mention it to you , but do n't say a word about it , for I should only be laughed at ; but I do assure you that I would kiss the Bible to it , if it was required .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 26]: I never did before believe in anything of that sort , that 's sartain ; but it 's no use talking about it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 19]: I think I had better get a lantern , and get over this coal business at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 30]: `` Yes , yes , '' replied Mr Culpepper ; `` but you wo n't know how much coals there are : I must go myself and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 16]: Bob Cross was soon ready with the lantern , and went forward with Mr Culpepper .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 23]: The hammocks had been piped down , and they were obliged to bend double under them to get along the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 4]: I followed unperceived .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 46]: The descent into the coal-hole was by battens , and not very easy for an old man like Mr C But Cross went down first , holding the light for the purser to follow , which he did very slowly , and with great caution .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 21]: As soon as they both stood on the coals below , the purser took the light to make his survey .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 18]: `` Why , there 's plenty of coals for three months , coxswain , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 18]: `` I thought there was ; you see they are nearly up to the beams abaft . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 5]: sir -- look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 12]: exclaimed Cross , starting back ; `` what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 6]: exclaimed Mr C , alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 15]: `` There , sir -- there he is : I told you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 40]: The purser 's eyes were directed to where Bob pointed , and then he beheld Tommy Dott standing immovable , with his arms extended , as if denouncing him -- his eyes staring , and his mouth wide open .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 3]: `` Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 4]: -- murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 26]: cried the purser , dropping the lantern , which went out and left them in the dark ; and he tumbled down on the coals .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 42]: Bob Cross stepped over him , and hastened up to the lower deck , followed by Tommy Dott , who first , by way of revenge , jumped several times upon the purser 's face and body before he climbed up .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 10]: The cry of the purser had given the alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 18]: The master-at-arms hastened forward with his lantern just as Tommy had made his appearance above the coamings .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 31]: Seeing Tommy as black as a sweep , he too was frightened ; the men had put their heads out of their hammocks and some of them had seen Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 18]: Bob Cross , as he crawled aft , cried out , `` Tommy Dott 's ghost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 24]: I had pretended to be terrified out of my wits as I ran aft , and all was confusion on the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 21]: The first lieutenant had come out of the wardroom , and seeing me , he inquired what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 20]: I replied that Mr Culpepper had gone down into the coal-hole , and had seen Mr Dott 's ghost .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 8]: He laughed heartily , and went back .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 51]: Tommy had in the mean time made his appearance in the mids ' berth , at which they had all rushed from him in dismay , just as I entered ; when I caught him by the hand saying , `` Tommy , my boy , how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 14]: They then perceived that it was Tommy himself , and order was restored .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 51]: Mr Culpepper was hoisted up out of the coal-hole ; Master Tommy having jumped upon his face , he looked a very miserable object , as he was well blackened , as well as much bruised from the soles of Tommy 's shoes , and his nose had bled profusely .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 22]: He was very incoherent for some time ; but the doctor gave him an opiate , and put him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 25]: The next morning the whole affair was explained on the quarterdeck , Master Tommy well reprimanded , and desired to return to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 27]: The captain was very much amused at the winding up of this affair , as it was a capital story to tell at the governor 's .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 23]: Tommy never had an idea that I had blown upon him , nor did Mr Culpepper imagine that their meeting was premeditated .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 55]: I had now completed the usual course of navigation under the master , and had no longer any cause for remaining in the cabin ; I therefore returned to my berth ; but as I had taken a liking to navigation , I now was employed daily in working sights and rating the chronometer .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 24]: We remained three weeks longer in Port Royal , and then were ordered out on a cruise , on the South American coast .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 21]: There we continued for nearly six months without anything occurring worth relating , except our having captured four good prizes .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 32]: We were returning to Jamaica , when we fell in with a schooner , which gave us the intelligence of the capture of the island of Curacao by four English frigates .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 27]: As we were near to the island and short of water , Captain Delmar resolved to touch at it , and remained two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 36]: The reader will perhaps recollect that the old Dutch gentleman , whose life I had saved in the pirate vessel , had stated that his name was Vanderwelt , and that he lived at Curacao .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 30]: The next evening we entered the harbour , and it was astonishing to every one how so strong a place could have been taken by so small a force .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 34]: The commodore , who had plenty of work on hand , requested , or rather ordered , our captain to remain with him for ten days or a fortnight , to assist him .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 26]: On the third day after our arrival I obtained leave to go on shore , as I wished to find out the old Dutch gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 38]: As I was again in the captain 's gig , I had very often landed , but had not had an opportunity of making inquiries , as I could not leave my boat and boat 's crew .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 28]: This afternoon I landed in the gig , and went up through the gate into the town , but I could not find anyone who spoke English .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 48]: At last , by asking for the house of Mynheer Vanderwelt , it was pointed out to me , and I went up to the door ; it was a very large house , with a verandah all round it , painted bright green and while alternately .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 92]: There were several slaves sitting down at the entrance , and I asked for Mynheer Vanderwelt ; they stared at me , and wondered what I wanted , but as I was in midshipman 's uniform , they were of course very civil , and one of them beckoned me to follow him , which I did , and was introduced to the old gentleman , who was sitting in a cane arm-chair with his pipe in his mouth , and fanned by two slave girls , about twelve years old .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 33]: As he had spoken to me in English on board of the pirate , I immediately went up to him , and said , `` How do you do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 20]: `` I am very well , sir , '' replied he , taking the pipe out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 6]: `` What do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 8]: do you come from the English commodore ?
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 6]: What is his pleasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 27]: `` No , sir , '' replied I ; `` I do not come from the commodore ; but I came up to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 26]: `` Oh , that is all , '' replied the old gentleman , putting his pipe in his mouth again , and resuming his smoking .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 22]: I felt rather nettled at his treatment , and then said -- `` Do n't you know me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 16]: `` No , sir , '' replied he , `` I have not that honour .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 18]: I have never seen you in my life before , and I do not know you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 9]: My blood was up at this cool declaration .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 49]: `` Then I wish you a good morning , sir , '' replied I ; and turning on my heel , I was strutting out with all the dignity of an offended midshipman , when I was met face to face by the little girl , his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 37]: She stared at me very much , and I passed her in sovereign contempt ; she followed me timidly , and looked into my face , then panting for breath , seized me by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 46]: I turned to her at being stopped in this manner , and was about to shake her off with anything but politeness , when she screamed out , and in a moment had sprung up , and was hanging with both arms round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 16]: `` Fader , fader , '' she cried out as I struggled to disengage myself .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 9]: The old gentleman came out at the summons .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 4]: `` Stop him !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 20]: fader ; do n't let him go away , '' cried she in Dutch ; `` it is he !
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 5]: it is he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 7]: `` Who , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 5]: asked the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 21]: `` The pirate-boy , '' replied the little girl , bursting into a paroxysm of tears , on my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 4]: `` Mein Gott !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 32]: it can not be ; he was _ black _ , my child ; yet , '' continued the old gentleman , looking at me , `` he is like him .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 11]: Tell me , sir , are you our preserver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` I was ; but that is of little consequence now .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: Will you oblige me by removing this young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 9]: continued I , for I was highly offended .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 22]: `` Sir , I ask your pardon , '' replied the old gentleman ; `` but I am not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 23]: How could I recognise you in a white person when you were so dark-coloured at our meeting on board of that vessel ?
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 16]: I am not to blame ; indeed I am not , my dear young friend .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 34]: I would have given ten thousand rix dollars to have met you , that I might prove my gratitude for your noble defence of us , and our preservation at such a risk .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 47]: Come , sir , you must forgive the mistake of an old man , who was certainly not inclined to be civil to an officer who belonged to the squadron , who had within these few days so humiliated us by their astonishing bravery and success .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 19]: Let my little girl , whose life you saved , persuade you , if I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 27]: In the mean time the little girl had dropped from my shoulder , and was on the floor , embracing my knees , and still sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 20]: I felt convinced that what the old gentleman said was true , and that he had not recognised me .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 23]: I had forgotten that I had been stained dark at the time that I had met them on board of the Stella .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 38]: I therefore held out my hand to the old gentleman , and raising the little girl , we all three went in together to where we had found the old gentleman on my first introduction to him .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 31]: `` If you knew how delighted I am to see you , and be able to express my thanks , '' said Mynheer Vanderwelt , `` and poor Minnie too .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 20]: How often have we talked over that dreadful day , and wondered if ever we should see you again .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 21]: I assure you , on my honour , that now I no longer regret the capture of the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 40]: Minnie stood by me during the time her father was speaking , her large blue eyes beaming through the tears with which they brimmed ; and as I turned to her , our eyes met , and she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 6]: I drew her towards me .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 45]: She appeared as if she only required some encouragement , for she immediately kissed me several times on the cheek nearest to her , every now and then saying a word or two in Dutch to her father , which I could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 15]: I hardly need say , that after this , intimacy was soon brought about .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 19]: If I thought that at first I had been treated with ingratitude , ample amends was made afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 12]: The old gentleman said during the evening , `` Good heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 48]: if my daughter 's eyes had not been sharper than mine ; if you had gone away , thinking that I did not choose to recognise you -- had I found it out afterwards , it would have broken my heart , and poor Minnie 's too .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 15]: I am grateful -- very grateful to God that it was not so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 12]: That I passed a very pleasant evening the reader may imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 16]: The household who had been told who I was , appeared to almost worship me .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 38]: The old gentleman asked me a hundred questions as to my parentage , etcetera , about Captain Delmar and the service , and begged of me to remain with him altogether while the frigate was in port .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 20]: I told him that was impossible , but that I would come as often as I could obtain leave .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 23]: At nine o'clock I bade them good night , and was escorted to the boat by six of the slaves carrying lanterns .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 38]: Captain Delmar , as well as all the other captains of the frigates , had taken up his quarters on shore for the harbour was so narrow and landlocked , that the heat on board was excessive .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 42]: I found that the next day old Mr Vanderwelt had paid his respects to Captain Delmar , giving him an account of what had occurred on board of the pirate much more flattering to me than what I had stated myself .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 21]: The steward was present at the time , and he had told Bob Cross , who communicated it to me .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 56]: Mynheer Vanderwelt had also begged as a favour that I might be permitted to stay on shore with him during the time that the frigate was in harbour , but to this Captain Delmar had not consented , promising , however , that I should have occasional leave when the service would permit of it .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 26]: The reader may recollect that the island of Curacao had been surrendered to the English in 1800 , and restored to the Dutch in 1802 .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 29]: During that interval several English merchants had settled there and remained after the restoration , and now at the second capture we found them still on the island .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 83]: From these we received the information that Mr Vanderwelt was the richest man on the island , and that the Dutch government was indebted to him in very large sums ; that he had long retired from business , although he had large property in the Havannah , which he received with his wife , who had been a Spanish lady , and that it was his intention to have gone back to Holland by the first man-of-war which should have arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 57]: We remained three weeks at Curacao , during which time the first lieutenant gave me leave to go on shore almost every evening after the captain had dismissed his gig , and to remain at Mr Vanderwelt 's till half-past eight the following morning , when I joined my boat , and attended on the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 35]: By this plan my duty was not interfered with , and I had many pleasant meetings with my new friends , and became , as may be imagined , very intimate with little Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 7]: I may as well describe her .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 45]: She was about ten years old , tall for her age ; she was very fair , with deep blue eyes , and very dark hair ; her countenance was very animated and expressive , and she promised to be a very handsome woman .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 33]: Her father doted upon her , for he had no other child ; he had married late in life , and his wife had died a few days after Minnie was born .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 38]: She was very affectionate in disposition , and very sweet-tempered ; up to the present she had received but little education , and that was one principal reason for Mr Vanderwelt 's wishing to return to Holland .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 16]: I soon became as one of the family , and certainly was treated as such .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 35]: Minnie was very curious to know what it was that I carried about my neck in the seal-skin pouch , but I never could tell either her or her father what it really was .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 21]: Mr Vanderwelt very often asked me if I liked being at sea , and I invariably replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 20]: At last the frigate was to sail , and I had but one more evening to pass with them .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 27]: Mr Vanderwelt appeared very grave , and little Minnie would every now and then during the evening burst into tears at the idea of our separation .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 13]: At last the hour of parting arrived -- it was very painful .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 35]: I promised to write to them , and Mr Vanderwelt told me that his house was always ready to receive me , and begged that if I wanted anything I would let him know .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 27]: I cried , myself , when I left the house -- the first time that I ever cried , I believe , on such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 16]: The next morning we were again under weigh , to rejoin the admiral at Jamaica .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 32]: Bob Cross had told me that he wished to have a little talk with me in the first watch , and I met him on the gangway , our usual rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 20]: `` Master Keene , I have some news for you , which I gained from the steward last night .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 45]: I will say , that his ears are always open ; not that I think he is generally what is called an eavesdropper but he likes you , and when you are concerned , he does care to find out what is going on .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 80]: Now you see , sir , that Dutch gentleman whom you saved from the nigger pirate came to call on Captain Delmar yesterday morning , and , after some palaver , he told the captain that he wished you to remain with him altogether , and leave his majesty 's service ; and he begged the captain to allow you to be discharged , and then he would be a father to you , as you had no father .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 22]: There was a great deal more which the steward could not make out , but it was all to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 70]: Well , the captain said that it was very true that you had lost your father but that he considered you as _ his own _ son , and could not part with you on any account ; and he stated that you were so promising an officer , that it be very wrong that you should leave the service , and that it must not be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 24]: The old gentleman said a great deal , and tried very hard to persuade the captain , but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 38]: The captain said he would never let you go till you were a post-captain and commanded a fine frigate , and then you would of course be your own master , and act as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 18]: `` I am very glad to hear all this , Bob , I can assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 42]: `` Yes , sir , it is very good news : but , Master Keene , I only hope , knowing Captain Delmar as you do , that you will act towards him as if you had never heard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 10]: `` I will , depend upon it , Cross .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 21]: As for leaving the service , that I would not have done even if Captain Delmar had agreed to it .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 17]: I 'm an Englishman , and I do n't want to be under Dutch protection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 19]: `` That 's right , sir -- that 's right -- just as I wished you to feel .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 5]: How time flies away .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 14]: Why , Master Keene , you have been afloat nearly three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: `` Within a month , Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 33]: `` And you 're growing such a tall fellow , they wo n't keep you much longer in the captain 's gig , I expect : I shall be sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 10]: So Master Tommy Dott is in another scrape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 8]: -- I heard nothing of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 18]: `` No , because it 's only within this half-hour that he 's got in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 5]: `` Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 121]: `` Why , sir , Mr Culpepper had fallen fast asleep on the gunroom table , under the skylight , which , as you know , is always open , and his head had fallen back , and his mouth was wide open : there was no other officer in the gun-room except Mr Culpepper : and Tommy Dott , who perceived him , asked Timothy Jenkins , the maintop-man , to give him a quid of tobacco ; well , Jenkins takes it out of his cheek , red-hot , as you may suppose , and hands it to Master Tommy , who takes his perpendicular very accurately , and drops the quid into the purser 's open mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 41]: `` Mr Culpepper was almost choked , but after a terrible coughing , the quid comes up again ; notwithstanding , he turns as sick as a dog , and is obliged to run to the basin in his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 87]: Well , sir , as soon as he comes out again , he goes up under the half deck , and inquires of the sentry who it was that did it ; and the sentry , who is that sulky fellow , Martin , instead of knowing nothing about it , says directly , it was Master Tommy ; and now there 's a formal complaint made by Mr Culpepper on the quarter-deck , and Master Tommy will get it as sure as a gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 45]: `` He do n't know how to play a trick , '' replied I ; `` he is always found out and punished : the great point is , not to be discovered -- that 's the real pleasure in playing a trick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 31]: `` Well , you certainly do manage well , Master Keene ; but I think it 's almost time you left them off now , you 're getting an oldster .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 10]: Why , you must be seventeen , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 12]: `` Yes , Bob , not very far from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 15]: `` Well , I suppose I must say Mister Keene for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 21]: `` You may call be what you like , Bob ; you have been a good friend to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 63]: `` Well , sir , I only hope that Captain Delmar will make you a post-captain , as he says , and that you 'll get a fine frigate , and I 'll be your coxswain ; but that 's a long way to look to , and we sha n't have any more councils of war on the gangway then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: `` No ; but we may in the cabin , Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 16]: `` A large sail on the starboard bow , '' cried the look-out man forward .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 17]: `` A large sail on the starboard bow , '' reported the mate of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 32]: My glass was on the capstern , and I ran for it , and went forward to examine the vessel , although my duty as signal midshipman was ended at sunset .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 12]: `` What do you make of it , Mr Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 7]: said the officer of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 25]: `` I think she is a man-of-war ; but it is so dark , that I can not make her out very clearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 8]: `` Is she standing this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , under top-sails and top-gallant-sails , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 22]: The officer of the watch went down to report to the captain , who had not yet turned into his cot .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 50]: Captain Delmar had been informed that a Dutch frigate was expected at the island , but not until the following month ; still we had no reason to suppose that there were any of our frigates down in these latitudes , except those lying in the harbour at Curacao .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 32]: The wind was light , about a three knot breeze , and there being no moon till after twelve o'clock , it was very difficult to make out what she was .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 8]: Some said she was a two-decked vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 27]: The captain went down to look at his private signals for the night , and before he came up I was all ready with the lanterns .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 16]: `` Two lights over one in a triangle ; be quick , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 11]: `` Aye , aye , sir , '' replied I .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 39]: The lights were soon hoisted at the peak , but as they could not well be seen by the other vessel , as we were standing towards her , we went about and hove to across her hawse .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 36]: For a quarter of an hour she continued to stand towards us without noticing the signals ; at last the captain said , `` They must be all asleep on board of the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 35]: `` No , Captain Delmar , '' replied I , keeping my telescope on the vessel , `` they are not all asleep , for I saw lights on the main-deck through the bow-ports .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 7]: I see them again now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 11]: `` So do I , '' said the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 16]: `` Then we 'll beat to quarters , Mr Hippesley , '' rejoined the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 74]: The men were summoned to quarters , and hammocks piped up and stowed in a very short time , the guns cast loose , and every man at his post -LRB- but the ports not opened -RRB- , waiting the coming down of the stranger , now about a mile distant , when suddenly she rounded to the wind on the same tack that we were , and set her royals and flying-jib .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 29]: `` She does not answer our signals , '' observed the captain : `` I suspect by that and her present manoeuvre she must be an enemy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 28]: `` I have no doubt of it , sir , '' observed the first lieutenant ; `` an English frigate would not behave in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 35]: `` Open the ports and get up the fighting lanterns , then , '' said the captain ; for , up to the present , we had been careful not to show any lights .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 21]: It was now plain to see that her men were at their quarters and that she was prepared for action .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 19]: When everything was ready on deck , the royals and flying-jib were set , and we gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 51]: The strange vessel was about three-quarters of a mile on our weather-beam ; in half an hour we had gained upon her considerably , and our sailing was so superior that we were satisfied , should she prove an enemy , that in an hour more we should be engaged .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 88]: Of course , we might have engaged her at the distance we were from her , but you can not be too careful in a night action , and ought never to engage without first hailing the vessel to make sure that she is an enemy , as circumstances may , and have occurred by which an English vessel may not be able to answer the private signal , and , of course , a vessel belonging to a neutral power would be in the same position .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 19]: The incertitude which existed as to whether the strange vessel was an enemy or not created great excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 37]: My duty , as signal midshipman , placed me abaft on the quarter-deck , and Bob Cross , who was really a quarter-master , although doing duty as captain 's coxswain , was at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 35]: At last we had brought the chase well on our weather quarter , and when we tacked we found that we lay well up , she being about a point on our lee bow .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 35]: Another half-hour brought us within two cables ' length of her , when we kept away , so as to pass her to leeward , close enough to have thrown a biscuit on board .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 23]: The stranger still remaining on the opposite tack , Captain Delmar then hailed from the gangway -- `` Ship , a-hoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 21]: There was a death-like silence on board of both vessels , and his voice pierced sonorously through the night wind .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 3]: yaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 4]: was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 7]: `` What ship is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 4]: continued Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 30]: During this time every man was at his gun ; the captains , with the lanyards of the locks in their hands , ready to pour in a broadside .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 15]: The reply from the other vessel was -- `` Vat chip is dat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 24]: `` His Britannic Majesty 's ship Calliope , '' replied Captain Delmar ; and then he repeated -- `` What ship is that ?
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: Let every man lie down at his quarters , '' said Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 48]: The order was hardly obeyed , when the stranger frigate poured in her broadside , and as we were then very close , with great execution to our hull and rigging : but as the men had been lying down , very few of them were hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 30]: As soon as the crash was over , Captain Delmar cried out -- `` Up , men , and fire , as I round to under her stern . ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 27]: In a few seconds we had passed through the volumes of smoke , and luffed up under her stern : we poured in our whole broadside .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 12]: `` Let her go off again -- flatten in there forward .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 10]: Reedy about , '' was the next order given .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 46]: We ran away from her about three cables ' length , until we had sufficient way to tack , and then we went about and stood towards her , steering for her weather quarter , as if we were going to engage her to windward .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 10]: `` Over to the larboard guns , my lads .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 12]: Hands by , after bracings and howlings , Mr Hippesley . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 11]: `` Aye , aye , sir , all ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 25]: As soon as we were near enough , the after-yards were shivered , the jib sheet to windward , and the helm put up .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 58]: The Calliope worked beautifully ; she paid sharp off , and we again passed under her stern , and gave another raking broadside ; very unexpected on the part of the Dutchman , who presumed that we were going to engage him to windward , and had his men all ready at his larboard guns in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 37]: The Dutch captain was evidently much annoyed : he stood at the taffrail , and , much to our amusement , cried out , in bad English , `` You coward -- not fight fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 63]: As we shot ahead of her , to leeward , she gave us a portion of her starboard broadside : but the men , having been over at the guns on the other side , were not quick enough , and they did us no injury ; whereas , her mizzen-mast fell over the side a few minutes after we passed her .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 79]: She then raid off , and so did we , so that she might not rake us , and broadsides were exchanged on equal terms ; but before we had exchanged these broadsides , both ships running with the wind on the quarter , we found that our superiority in sailing free was so great , that we shot ahead of him out of his fire , and we were enabled to luff up and rake him again .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 91]: The last raking broadside brought down his main-topmast and then she was all our own , as Bob Cross said ; as she could not round to with no after sail , and we could from our superiority in sailing , take our position as we pleased , which we did , constantly keeping ahead of him , and raking him , broadside after broadside , and receiving but one broadside in return , until his foremast went by the board , and he had nothing but his main-mast standing .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 84]: This bettered his condition on the whole ; as , although hardly manageable with so little wind , he had more power over his vessel , as far as rounding to the wind , which he did , and the action continued ; but our fighting under sail gave us great advantage , and although an occasional shot would come in , and we had to carry some men into the cockpit , for one shot we received , we certainly returned ten .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 28]: The action had continued about an hour , when , by the continual cannonading , the light wind was beaten down , and it fell dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 18]: This put us again upon a more equal footing , as the Calliope had not steerage way .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 40]: We were then about a quarter of a mile apart , lying head and stern ; but both ships had fallen off during the calm , so that only the quarter guns of each could be brought to bear .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 41]: The major portion of the ship 's company being , therefore , not able to use their guns , were employed in repairing the damages we had received , which were very considerable , especially in the sails and rigging .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 69]: I was standing by Bob Cross , who was looking out for cats ' paws , as we call slight breaths of wind , when he said in a low voice : -- `` Master Keene , I never had an idea that the captain could handle his ship so well : he really knows what he 's about as well as any man in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 13]: `` I thought so , too , '' replied I. `` Whew !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 37]: there 's a nasty shot , '' cried I , as one came in and upset half a dozen of the marines , who were hauling upon the mizzen-topsail sheet , which had just been spliced .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 92]: `` Yes , sir , that chap is made of good stuff , depend upon it -- all the Dutchmen are : if they could only keep their hands out of their breeches pockets , they would be rummer customers than they are now ; as it is , they are not to be played with ; and , depend upon it , we 're a long way off having him yet : we must pray for wind to come up and he must pray for the calm to continue . ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 7]: `` Where 's Mr Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 14]: said the captain , who was on the other side of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 16]: `` Here , sir , '' said I , running up and touching my hat .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 28]: `` Mr Keene , go down quietly and ascertain how many men we have hurt : the doctor will be able to tell you pretty nearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 66]: `` Aye , aye , sir , '' replied I , and I dived down below ; just as I did so , a shot came in and cut away the lower rail of the copper stanchions which were round the hatchway , about a foot beyond my hat : had I not gone down so quickly , it would have taken my head off .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 36]: I went down into the gun-room , for the doctor preferred being there to the cockpit , as there was so much more room to operate , and I gave him the captain 's message .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 12]: He was very busy taking off a poor fellow 's leg .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 12]: It was a horrible sight and made me sick and faint .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 39]: As soon us the bone had been sawed off , he said -- `` You will find all the wounded I have dressed in the steerage ; those they have brought me down dead are in the cockpit .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 39]: There have been five amputations already the master is badly wounded , and Mr Williams the mate , is killed : those whom I have not been able to attend to yet , are here in the gun-room .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 14]: You must ascertain what the captain wishes to know yourself , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 18]: I can not , leave a leg with the arteries not taken up , to count heads .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 13]: Mr Rivers , the tenaculum -- ease the tourniquet , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 20]: As I felt what the doctor said to be true , I got a lantern and commenced my examinations .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 22]: I found fourteen wounded men waiting the doctor 's care in the gun-room , which was almost a pool of blood .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 27]: In the steerage there were nine who had been dressed , and four in their hammocks , who had undergone amputation of the arm or leg .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 19]: I then went down into the cockpit , where I counted eleven of our best men lying dead .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 52]: Having obtained the information required , I was proceeding up the cockpit ladder , when I turned towards the purser 's steward 's room , and saw Mr Culpepper , the purser , on his knees before a lantern ; he looked very pale -- he turned round and saw me .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 20]: `` Nothing , sir ; only the captain wishes to know how many men are killed and wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 18]: `` Tell him I do not know : surely he does not want me on deck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 31]: `` He wants to know how many men are hurt , sir , '' replied I , for I perceived that he thought that the message was sent to him .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 5]: `` Mercy on me !
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 17]: Stop a minute , Mr Keene , and I 'll send up word by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 17]: `` I ca n't stop , sir , '' replied I , going up the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 38]: Mr Culpepper would have called me back , but I preferred leaving him in his error , as I wished to see which he most dreaded , the captain 's displeasure or the shot of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 9]: I returned on deck and made my report .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 11]: The captain looked very grave , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 24]: I found that the two frigates were now lying stern to stern , and firing occasional guns , which raked fore and aft .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 25]: Except the men who worked the guns aft , our people were lying down at their quarters , by the order of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 30]: `` If we only had but a capful of wind , '' said the captain to the first lieutenant , `` but I see no appearance of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 30]: I touched my hat and said , `` The moon will rise in about ten minutes , sir , and she often brings the wind up with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 16]: `` That 's true , Mr Keene , but it 's not always the case .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 20]: I only hope she will ; if not , I fear we shall lose more of our men . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 24]: The firing continued , and our main-mast had received so many shots , that we were obliged to hold it for its support .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 21]: While so employed , the moon rose , and the two vessels had now a good view of each other .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 54]: I directed my glass to the horizon under the moon , and was delighted to perceive a black line , which promised wind ; I reported it to the master , and the promise was kept good , for in a quarter of an hour our sails flapped , and then gradually filled .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 13]: `` She has steerage way , sir , '' reported Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 11]: `` Thank Heaven for that , '' replied Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 6]: `` Jump up , men .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 9]: Brace round the yards , Mr Hippesley . ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 28]: `` The enemy 's main yard is cut in two in the slings , sir , '' reported I , after I had my glass upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 13]: `` Then her last hope is gone , '' replied Mr Hippesley .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 15]: `` Haul over the starboard jib-sheet forward -- let her come to , quartermaster .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 7]: Larboard guns , my lads . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 19]: `` Now , my men , '' cried Captain Delmar , `` make short work of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 5]: This injunction was obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 69]: We had now a good sight of the enemy , and brought our whole broadside to bear upon her stern ; and after a quarter of an hour more firing I perceived that her ensign was no longer on the staff , where it had been hoisted after the fall of the mizenmast ; neither had she for the last five minutes given us a gun in return .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 24]: `` She has struck , sir , I think , '' said I to Captain Delmar ; `` her ensign is down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 24]: `` Pass the word ` Cease firing , ' Mr Hippesley ; but let the guns be all reloaded in case of accidents .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 8]: Have we a boat that can swim ?
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: Examine the cutters , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 23]: I found the cutter on the larboard quarter , with her bottom out : she could not swim , that was clear .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 8]: The starboard one was in better condition .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 25]: `` The starboard cutter will float , sir ; her gunwale is all torn away , but there are rollocks enough to pull . ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 13]: `` Let her be cleared away and lowered down , Mr Hippesley .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 7]: Send for the second lieutenant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 16]: `` I believe he 's not on deck sir , '' replied the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 9]: `` Not much hurt , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 11]: `` A splinter , I was told , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 10]: `` Where 's Mr Weymss , the third lieutenant ?
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 53]: Mr Weymss , jump into the boat , and take possession of the prize : take as many men as you can ; and , Mr Keene , with Mr Weymss , and as soon as you have gained the necessary information , come back with the boat and two hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 18]: I followed the third lieutenant info the boat , and we pulled on board of our antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 14]: A junior officer received us on the deck , and presented his sword .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 17]: His left arm was bound up , and he was very pale from loss of blood .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 53]: He spoke pretty good English ; and we found that we had captured the Dort , Dutch frigate , of thirty-eight guns , bound to Curacao , with a detachment of troops for the garrison , and a considerable quantity of ammunition and specie on board for the use of the colony .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 17]: We inquired whether the captain was much hurt , as he did not appear on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 19]: `` He is dead , gentlemen , '' replied the young officer : `` he was my father .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 7]: Our loss has been very great .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 13]: I am only a cadet , yet I am commanding officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 22]: A tear rolled down his cheek as he said that the captain was his father , and I felt for him .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 25]: Shortly afterwards he staggered to a carronade slide , and dropped down on it , and very soon was in a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 18]: The carnage had been dreadful , and the bulwarks of the vessel had been shattered to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 21]: The scene was almost as had as the Stella 's decks before she was blown up by the negro captain .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 13]: Several of the guns were dismounted and two of them had burst .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 30]: I had only time to go round the gun-deck , and then I ordered two hands into the boat , that I might make my report to Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 45]: I asked the third lieutenant to allow me to take on board the young officer , who still remained lifeless on the carronade slide , and , as it was proper for me to bring back with me the commanding officer , he consented .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 44]: We lowered him with a rope into the boat , and then I returned on board of the Calliope , and went up to the captain to make my report , and present him with the sword of the officer commanding the prize .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 34]: Just as I was commencing my story , Mr Culpepper came up without his wig , and in a state of great disorder , with a piece of dirty paper in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 48]: He trembled very much from the effects of his alarm , but made a very profound bow , and said to Captain Delmar -- `` Here is the state of killed and wounded , Captain Delmar , as far as I have been able to collect them .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 27]: I could not possibly get them ascertained before , although I have been an hour or two employed -- ever since Mr Keene came down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 35]: The captain , who did not like the interruption , replied very haughtily , `` Mr Culpepper , it 's the duty of the surgeon to send in the report of killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 16]: You had better go down below , get your dress in a little better order .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 6]: Now , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 26]: Old Culpepper slunk away as I proceeded to give the information , and the captain now asked the carpenter if the pinnace was sufficiently repaired .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 13]: `` In a few minutes , sir , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 27]: `` Mr Hippesley , you must , then , send forty hands on board the prize to repair her damages , as far as we can .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 8]: Mr Weymss must remain on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 25]: In the meantime the young officer had been taken down below to the surgeon , who had now some leisure to attend to him .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 21]: He was soon restored , and the surgeon expressed his opinion that it would be possible to save his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 69]: I went down to see him , and I gave him my hammock to sleep in for the present , and as soon as he was comfortably arranged under the half-deck I returned to the quarter-deck , and made myself as useful as I could , for we had plenty to do on board of our own frigate , knotting and splicing , having only made temporary repairs .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 14]: It was now dawn of day , and very soon afterwards broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 31]: The men were ordered aft with the buckets , and the decks , which were smeared and black with powder and the blood of the wounded , were washed down .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 30]: That we were all very tired I hardly need say , but it was not yet time for repose ; the magazines had been secured and the fires lighted .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 29]: Another boat , with the carpenter and assistant-surgeon , had been sent on board the prize to remedy any serious damage and to assist in dressing the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: I was sent with the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 34]: Mr Weymss , the third lieutenant , had not been idle : jury-masts were in preparation , the decks had been cleared , the dead thrown overboard , and the wounded taken below .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 66]: On mustering the remainder of the Dort 's ship 's company , and calling over the muster-roll of the troops on board , we found that she had lost the captain , 2 lieutenants and 10 officers , 73 seamen and 61 soldiers , killed ; and the first-lieutenant , 13 officers , and 137 wounded -- 147 killed and 151 wounded : total 298 .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 44]: She had received several shot between wind and water , and had a good deal of water in the hold : this was , however , soon remedied by the carpenter and his crew , and the frigate pumped out by the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 52]: I returned on board of the Calliope with this intelligence to the captain , and found that the surgeon had just sent in the report of our own loss , which was , 1 officer and 17 men killed -- master , 2 lieutenants , 2 midshipmen , and 47 wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 11]: `` Do you know who are the midshipmen wounded ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 6]: said the captain to me .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 42]: `` I heard that Mr James was killed , sir , but not the names of those who are wounded ; but I think one of them must be Mr Dott , or we certainly should have seen him about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 12]: `` I should not be surprised , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 12]: `` Sentry , ask who are the young gentlemen wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 12]: The sentry replied , `` Mr Castles and Mr Dott . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 30]: `` Well , '' replied the captain , `` he 'll be in no more mischief for some time ; I heard of his trick to the purser . ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 35]: As the captain was saying this , I perceived the piece of paper which the purser had brought up as his report of killed and wounded lying on the table with the other reports .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 49]: It had , apparently , not been examined by the captain , but my eye caught it , and I observed , written in a shaking hand , `` Pieces of beef , 10 ; ditto pork , 19 ; raisins , 17 ; marines , 10 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 6]: I could not help smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 15]: `` What are you amused with , Mr Keene , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 7]: said the captain , rather gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 45]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , for venturing so in your presence , '' replied I ; `` but it is Mr Culpepper 's report of killed and wounded ; '' which I then took up , and handed to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 24]: This proof of Mr Culpepper 's state of mind during the conflict was too much for even Captain Delmar , who laughed outright .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 9]: `` The old fool , '' muttered he .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 9]: `` You may go now , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 20]: If breakfast is ready , tell Mr Hippesley to let the men have it as soon as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 44]: `` Aye , aye , sir , '' replied I , and bowing respectfully , I quitted the cabin ; for I felt that Captain Delmar thought that he had not been quite so reserved towards me as he always wished to be .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 20]: As soon as I had given the captain 's orders , I went down to find out Tommy Dott .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 20]: He was in his hammock , next to mine , in which I had put the young Dutch officer .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 12]: Dott was wide awake , and , apparently , very feverish .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 9]: `` Where are you hurt , Tommy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 13]: `` I am sure I do n't know , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 9]: `` Get me some water , Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: I got a pannikin of water , and he drank it .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 11]: `` Do n't you know where you are hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 32]: `` I believe it 's my side -- somewhere about the body , I know ; but I 'm so stiff all over , that I ca n't tell exactly where .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 28]: Something hit me , and I fell right down the hatchway ; that 's all I know about it until I found myself in my hammock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 24]: `` Well , at all events , you wo n't be punished now for dropping the quid into Mr Culpepper 's mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 45]: `` No , '' replied Tommy , with a smile , in spite of his pain ; `` but I would have played him a better trick than that if I had had any idea that we should have been so soon in action .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 17]: I wish I could turn round , Keene -- I think I should be easier . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 13]: I turned poor Tommy in his hammock , and then left him .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 30]: I looked at the son of the Dutch captain -- he was slumbering ; he was a very slight youth , with very beautiful , but very feminine features .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 29]: I felt a kindness towards him , poor fellow ; for he had lost his father , and he was about to pass his best years in prison .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 24]: But the boatswain 's mates piped to breakfast , and I hastened down into the berth to get my share of the cocoa .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 48]: As soon as the men had finished their breakfast , the hands were again turned up , the lower deck cleared and washed , new sails bent and the guns properly secured ; screens were put up round the half-deck where the wounded were in their beds .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 35]: The dead were brought up and sewed up in their hammocks , laid out on gratings , and covered with the ensign and union jack , preparatory to their being committed to the deep .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 35]: Another party was sent to assist on board of the prize , and the prisoners were brought on board , and put down in the fore-hold , which had been cleared for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 77]: By noon everything was so far ready that we were enabled to take the prize in tow , and make sail on the Calliope , after which the men , who were exhausted , went to dinner , and were permitted to sleep during the remainder of the day until the evening , when the ship 's company was ordered up , and the dead were committed to the deep blue sea with the usual ceremonies .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 38]: The breeze was steady but the water was smooth during the night , and glad I was to throw myself on one of the lockers in the midshipmen 's berth , after so many hours of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 58]: I slept till four in the morning , and finding the planks not quite so soft as they might be , I then turned into the hammock of the midshipman of the morning watch , and remained till six hells , when Bob Cross came down and told me that the captain would soon be on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 44]: `` Well , Cross , '' said I , as I came on deck and went aft to look at the prize in tow , `` this is a nice business , and our captain will gain a great deal of credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 43]: `` And he deserves it , Master Keene , '' replied Cross : `` as I said before , I never had an idea that he could handle his ship so well -- no , nor none of the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 20]: We all thought Mr Hippesley the best officer of the two , but we have found out our mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 37]: The fact is , Mr Keene , Captain Delmar wraps himself an in his dignity like a cloak , and there 's no making him out , till circumstances oblige him to take it off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 45]: `` That 's very true , Bob , '' replied I : `` it is only this very morning that he laughed himself , and I laughed also , and he pulled up immediately afterwards , twice as stiff to me as before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 16]: I then told Bob of Mr Culpepper 's report , which amused him very much .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 28]: `` I am sure that he is pleased with you , Mr Keene , and I must say that you were very useful and very active . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 47]: `` Do you know that the carpenter says that we have received injuries that can not be well repaired without the ship going into dock , and I should not be surprised if we were to be sent home , if the survey confirms his report .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 36]: I hope we shall ; I am tired of the West Indies , and I should like to see my mother ; we have a nice breeze now , and we are two points free .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 16]: If it lasts , we shall be at Jamaica in a fortnight or less . ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 12]: The captain coming on deck put an end to our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 24]: Before night the prize had got up jury-masts , and sail set upon them , and we went through the water more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 12]: In ten days we arrived at Port Royal with our prize .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 24]: The captain went on shore , and what was still more agreeable , we got rid of all our prisoners and wounded men .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 29]: A survey , in consequence of the carpenter 's report was held upon the Calliope , and the result was , she was ordered home to be repaired .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 43]: The Dort was commissioned by the admiral , and Mr Hippesley received an acting order to the sloop of war , which had become vacant by the commander of her being promoted into the Dort , which was now christened the Curacao .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 17]: In ten days after our arrival we were ready , and made sail for Old England .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 20]: Tommy Dott and the second lieutenant remained on board , and were both convalescent before we entered the Channel .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 26]: Tommy Dott 's wound , by the bye , was a splinter in the back , added to severe bruises from tumbling down the hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 41]: Captain Delmar had shown great kindness to the son of the Dutch captain and he did not send him on shore with the rest of the prisoners , but permitted him to remain , and come home in the Calliope .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 28]: He recovered slowly , but was soon out of danger , and was walking about with his arm in a sling long before we arrived in England .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 40]: It appeared to me that , during the passage home , old Culpepper was not so much in the good graces of Captain Delmar as he used to be ; he was , however , more obsequious than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 24]: We had a fine run home , and in seven weeks from our leaving Port Royal , we dropped our anchor at Spithead .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 47]: I may have been wrung , but it certainly did appear to me that as we neared the coast of England , the behaviour of Captain Delmar was more reserved to me -LRB- I may say it was harsher -RRB- than ever it had been before .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 38]: Hurt at treatment which I felt I did not deserve , I tried to analyse the cause as I walked up and down the deck , and at last I decided that his pride was again alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 59]: On the one hand he was returning to his own country , to meet with his aristocratical connections , and on the other he was reminded of my mother , and his _ mesalliance _ with her -- if such a term can be used to a woman who had sacrificed herself to one above her in rank .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 37]: At all events , I was the result of that connection , and I presumed that he was ashamed of it , and consequently kept me at a distance , and checked his feelings towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 56]: Perhaps he thought that my mother might be induced to disclose to me that which I had under his own hand-writing , and wore next my heart ; or he might consider I was no longer a boy , but a tall young man , and one who might be induced to claim his protection .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 22]: Such were my reflections , and my resolutions were taken accordingly -- I wanted no Bob Cross to counsel me now .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 55]: When the captain left the ship , I made no request , as did the other midshipmen , for leave to see my friends ; nor even when he returned on board , which he did several times after the ship had gone into harbour , and was stripping , preparatory to being docked .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 43]: One thing , however , gave me great satisfaction , which was , that when the despatch which we brought home was published , I found my name honourably mentioned in conjunction with other officers , and but three midshipmen were named .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 15]: When the Calliope went into dock the report of the dockyard was very unfavourable .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 11]: She required a thorough repair which would take some months .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 9]: She was therefore ordered to be paid off .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 11]: In the mean time the captain had gone to London .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 33]: During his sojourn at Portsmouth I had never spoken to him , except on duty , and he had left me without a word of explanation as to his intentions towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 81]: As soon , however , as the order came down for paying off the ship , I received a letter from him , very cold and stiff , stating that I might , if I pleased , join any other ship , and he would recommend me to the captain ; or I might remain on the books of the guard-ship , and wait until he commissioned another vessel , when he would be happy to take me with him .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 5]: My reply was immediate .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 37]: I thanked him for his kindness , and hoped I might remain on board the guard-ship until he took the command of another vessel , as I did not wish to sail with any other captain .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 23]: I had been brought forward by him in the service , and preferred waiting for months rather than lose his kind protection .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 28]: The only reply to my letter was an order from the Admiralty , for me to be discharged into the guard-ship when the Calliope was paid off .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 55]: I hardly need say that I had written and received letters from my mother , who was delighted at my name being mentioned in the despatches ; but I will defer family news till the proper opportunity , as I must first tell all that occurred in the Calliope before she was paid off .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 34]: The reader will recollect that the son of the Dutch captain , whose name was Vangilt , had been permitted to come home in the ship , instead of being sent to prison .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 26]: He and I were very intimate and when I discovered that he was the cousin of Minnie Vanderwelt , I became more partial to him .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 32]: He was very melancholy during the passage home ; how , indeed , could he be otherwise , with the prospect of being a prisoner during the remainder of the war ?
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 10]: and he often expressed his feelings on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 7]: `` Could you not escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: said I , one evening .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 9]: `` I fear not , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 40]: `` If once out of prison , I have no doubt but that I could get a conveyance over the Channel by means of the smugglers ; indeed , I have connections in England who would assist me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 67]: When Captain Delmar went away to town , he had quite forgotten the poor fellow , and Mr Weymss , who was the commanding officer , did not make any special report of him as he thought he might defer it till the last moment , as every day out of prison would be so much gained by young Vangilt , who was a general favourite .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 26]: In this instance , my regard for the young man made me quite forget my duty as an officer , and the Articles of War .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 51]: I knew that I was about to do wrong ; but I considered that , with so many thousand prisoners which we had in England , one more or less could be of no consequence , and I set to work to see if I could not effect his escape .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 19]: After much cogitation , I found I could do nothing without Bob Cross and I consulted with him .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 37]: Bob shook his head , and said it was , he believed , hanging matter ; but , after all , it was a pity that such a nice lad should be peeping between iron bars .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 26]: `` Besides , '' continued he , `` he lost his father in the action , and he ought not to lose his liberty also .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 14]: Well , Mr Keene , show me how I can help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 35]: `` Why , Bob there 's a very pretty little girl , who very often comes alongside with the old woman , and you go down into the boat and talk with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 30]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Bob , `` that 's the little girl I told you of , that used to repeat her fables on my knee .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 14]: The fact is , I hope to splice her some of these days .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 49]: It 's her mother who is with her , and she will not let her come on board to mix with the other women , because she is good and modest ; too good for me , I 'm afraid , in one sense of the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 8]: `` How do you mean Bob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 64]: `` Why , sir , when I first knew her , she and her mother were living upon what they could earn , for the father was killed in action many years ago , and I used to help them as far as I could ; but now I find that , although they are not changed , things are , most confoundedly .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 72]: Her uncle lost his wife ; he is considered a rich man , and being stone blind , and having no one to take care of him after his wife 's death , he sent for this girl and her mother to keep his house and he is very fond of the girl , and declares that he will leave her all his money , and that she shall marry well .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 38]: Now , sir , if she was to marry me , a petty officer only , it would not be considered that she married well ; so you see , sir , there 's a hitch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 8]: `` Who and what was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 33]: `` He was a smuggler , sir , and a very successful one ; he has six or seven houses , all his own property besides the one he lives in himself .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 12]: He lives about a quarter of a mile out of Gosport .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 13]: I know all about him , although I have never seen him .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 67]: Soon after he left off smuggling , he lost his eyesight , and , somehow or another , he considered it was a judgment upon him -- at least his wife , who had joined the Ranters , persuaded him so -- and so he took a religious turn , and now he does nothing but pray , and call himself a poor blind sinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 19]: `` Well , Bob , but I do not see why you should give up the girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 15]: `` No , sir ; nor will she or her mother give me up .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 21]: I could marry her to-morrow without his consent , but I do not like to do her that injury . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 9]: `` He is stone-blind , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 10]: `` We 'll talk your affair over another time .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 16]: What I want at present is , to help this poor young Vangilt to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 21]: He says , that if once clear , the smugglers would put him on the other side of the water .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 43]: Now , it appears to me that it would be very easy for him to get out of the ship unperceived , if he were dressed in woman 's clothes , so many women are going and coming all day long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 18]: `` Very true , sir , especially on pay-day , when nobody keeps any look-out at all .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 21]: I see now , you want some of Mary 's clothes for him ; they would fit very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 30]: `` Exactly ; and I think that , as her uncle had been a smuggler , we might go and consult him as to his escape over the water .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 13]: Vangilt will pay 100 pounds with pleasure -- he told me so .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 18]: That will be an introduction for you as well as for me to the old fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 22]: `` I think we had better let the old fellow suppose it 's a woman -- do n't you , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 8]: But what shall we call ourselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 21]: `` Why , I will be a sort of agent for ships , an you shall be a captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 4]: `` A captain !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 4]: Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 16]: `` Yes ; a captain , who has had a ship , and expects another .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 16]: Why , you were a captain of the fore-top before you were rated coxswain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 27]: `` Well , sir , I must consult Mary and her mother , and then I 'll let you know : they will come this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 12]: Perhaps in helping Mr Vangilt , I may help myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 96]: That night Bob Cross told me that Mary and her mother were quite willing to assist , and that they thought it would be a very good introduction to old Waghorn : that we must expect some religious scruples at first , but we must persevere , and they had no doubt that the old man would contrive to get the young man over to Cherbourg , or some other place on the other side ; that we had better call on him in the evening , and they would be out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 27]: As soon as the work was over for the day , Bob Cross and I obtained leave , and set off for Mr Waghorn 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 22]: We were met by Mary and her mother , who pointed it out to us , and then continued their walk .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: We went to the door , and found the old man smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 12]: cried he , as we lifted the latch of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 20]: `` Friends , sir , '' replied Cross ; `` two persons who come to talk on business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 3]: `` Business !
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 30]: I 've no business -- I 've done with business long ago : I think of nothing but my perishing soul -- poor blind worm that I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 42]: He was a very fine-looking old man , although weather-beaten , and his silver locks hung down on his collar ; his beard was not shaved , but clipped with scissors : his want of sight gave him a mournful look .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 28]: `` Nevertheless , sir , I must introduce myself and my friend , the captain , '' replied I , `` for we want your assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 4]: `` My assistance !
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: poor blind beetle -- how can I assist you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 56]: `` The fact is , sir , that a young woman is very anxious to return to her friends , on the other side of the water ; and knowing that you have acquaintance with those who run to and fro , we thought you might help the poor young woman to a passage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 15]: `` That 's to say , you 've heard that I was a smuggler .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 38]: People do say so ; but , gentlemen , I now pay customs and excise -- my tea has paid duty , and so has my tobacco ; so does everything -- the king has his own .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 16]: The Bible says , ` Render under Caesar the things which are Caesar 's . '
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 8]: Gentlemen , I stand by the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 14]: I am a poor , sinful old wretch -- God forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 32]: `` We ask nothing against the Bible , Mr Waghorn ; it 's our duty to assist those who are in distress ; it 's only a poor young woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 6]: `` A poor young woman .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 49]: If she 's poor , people do n't do such work for nothing ; besides , it 's wrong , gentlemen -- I 've given up all that , -- I 've a precious soul to look after , and I ca n't divert my attention from it .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 8]: I wish you good-bye , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: At this moment Mary and her mother returned , and we rose up .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 10]: `` Mrs James , is that you and Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 27]: Here 's a captain and his friend come to me ; but it 's a fool 's errand , and so I 've told them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 21]: I then stated to Mrs James what we had come for , and begged that she would persuade Mr Waghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 11]: `` Well , Mr Waghorn , why wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 16]: -- it 's a good action , and will have its reward in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 25]: `` Yes ; but she 's a poor young woman , and ca n't pay her passage , so it 's no use . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 38]: `` On the contrary , '' replied I , `` the captain here will become security , that 100 pounds shall be paid down as soon as she arrives in any part of France or Holland . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: `` Will he ?
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 7]: But who 's the captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 44]: `` I have n't a ship just now , but I expect one soon , '' replied Bob ; `` the money shall be paid at once , if you will only receive the young woman until she can be sent off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 17]: `` Well let me see -- there 's James Martin ; no he wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 12]: There 's Will Simpson ; yes , that 's the man .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 20]: Well , it 's a good act ; and , captain , when will you bring the money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 65]: Now the ship was to be paid off on Wednesday and as we had each three years ' pay due , there was no difficulty about that ; so I replied , `` On Wednesday , the captain will give the money to this lady , or whoever comes with us to receive the young woman ; will you not , Captain Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 16]: certainly ; the money is ready at an hour 's notice , '' replied Bob .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 28]: `` I 'm sure that she 'll pay me back , if she can ; and if she ca n't , it 's of no consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 16]: `` Well , well , it 's a bargain , '' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 26]: `` I 'm a poor blind beetle , a sinful old soul ; I 've nothing to do but to make my peace with Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 17]: It 's charity -- ` Charity covereth a multitude of sins , ' saith St. Paul .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 9]: Recollect 100 pounds -- that 's the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 25]: I 'll send Mrs James to you ; you must not call again till she 's on the other side of the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 10]: `` Many thanks , sir , '' replied Bob .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 34]: `` I wo n't call till I hear she is safe , and then I 'll bring you some tobacco to smoke , such as you do n't often pick up nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 20]: `` Happy to see you , Captain Cross , and your friend there , '' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 6]: We then took our leave .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 35]: Mrs James , after we were gone , praised the appearance of Captain Cross , as such a nice-looking man , and old Waghorn evidently thought well of him by the answer he made .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 9]: Mary , however , pretended to prefer me .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 18]: As soon as I returned on board , I told young Vangilt what I had been about .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 13]: He wrung my hand , and the tears started in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 14]: `` You , as an officer , are indeed risking much for me .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 39]: As to the money , you know me , I trust , too well , not to be sure of receiving it as soon as I can send it ; but I never can repay your kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 18]: `` Perhaps you may be able to help me one of these days , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 4]: `` Who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 24]: It 's fortune of war , my good fellow ; but it 's as well not to be seen too much together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 7]: So saying , I left him .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 27]: The next day , Mrs James came off with the necessary garments and bonnet for his escape , and they were given me by Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 33]: The day after was pay-day ; and the ship was in such a state of confusion , and there were so many people on board , that there was no difficulty whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 34]: Vangilt changed his clothes in the midshipmen 's berth , which was empty , and Bob Cross handed him down the side into the boat , where Mrs James waited to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 19]: Bob and I had both been paid , and we gave her the 100 pounds for old Waghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 65]: The boat shoved off ; Vangilt arrived safe at Waghorn 's house , where he was kept concealed for eight days , when , for the sum of 20 pounds , he was safely landed on the French coast , old Waghorn having pocketed 80 pounds by the transaction which , considering he acted out of pure charity , was a pretty good reward .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 47]: Having thus successfully managed , by being guilty of high treason , in aiding and abetting the enemy , I bade farewell to Bob Cross , leaving him to follow up his amour , while I went to Chatham to pay my respects to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 10]: I had made up my mind how to act .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 17]: I was no longer a child , but a man in reflection as well as appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 23]: I arrived , and hastened to the house from which I had escaped so mysteriously the last time I was in it .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 21]: My mother threw herself in my arms , embracing me , and then looking at me with surprise and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 44]: Three years and a half had changed me ; she hardly knew me , for her association of ideas had still pictured me as the smart stripling whom she had , with so much anguish , consigned into the hands of Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 42]: She was proud of me -- my adventures , my dangers , my conduct , and my honourable mention in the Gazette , were all known to her , and she had been evidently congratulated by many upon my successful career .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 32]: My grandmother , who had grown much older in appearance , seemed to be softened towards me , and I had sense enough to receive her advances with great apparent cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 33]: My aunt and the captain were delighted to see me , and I found that my two cousins , of whose appearance I had been duly apprised , were very pretty children .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 27]: I found that my mother had two assistants in her business and everything appeared to be on a grander scale , and more flourishing than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 108]: The first two or three days were devoted to narratives , communications , explanations , and admirations , as is usually the case after so long an absence ; after which we quietly settled down in the relative positions of mother and son , and she assumed , or rather would have assumed , her control over me ; but this was not my wish ; I had made up my mind that , although a clever woman , I must in future control her , and I took the first opportunity of a long _ tete-a-tete _ to let her know that such was my intention .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 29]: Speaking of Captain Delmar , I at once told her that I knew he was my father , and that I had his own handwriting to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 49]: She denied it at first ; but I told her that all denial was useless , that I had possession of the letter he had written to her upon my supposed death , and that it was no ghost , but I , who had frightened my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 33]: This was my first blow , and a heavy one , to my poor mother ; for what woman can bear to be humiliated by her offspring being acquainted with her indiscretion ?
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 43]: I loved my mother , and would fain have spared her this pang , had it not been that all my future plans were based upon this one point , and it was necessary she should aid and abet me in them .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 129]: My poor mother was bowed to the earth when she found that it was in vain to deny my parentage ; she covered her face with her hands in deep shame before her child , but I consoled , and caressed , and told her -LRB- what I really felt -RRB- , that I was indebted to her for not being the son of a private marine ; that , at all events , I had noble blood in my veins , and would prove myself worthy of my descent , whether it were acknowledged or not ; but from that hour I took the command over her -- from that hour it was I that dictated , and her authority as a parent was gone for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 34]: Let it not be imagined that I treated her harshly ; on the contrary , I was more kind , and , before other people , more dutiful than ever I was before .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 59]: She was my only confidant , and to her only did I explain the reasons of my actions : she was my adviser , but her advice was not that of a parent , but that of an humble , devoted , and attached friend ; and during the remainder of her days this position was never altered .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 19]: As soon as my mother had acknowledged the fact there was no longer any reservation on my part .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 13]: I told her what was the conduct of Captain Delmar towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 30]: I pointed out his checking any display of paternal feelings towards me , and also the certainty that I had that he was partial to and proud of me .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 23]: I explained to her the line of conduct which I had pursued , and was determined still to pursue , towards him .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 46]: `` Percival , '' said my mother , `` I see the judiciousness of what you say and of your behaviour towards him ; but allow me to ask you : What is the object you are aiming at -- I mean particularly aiming at ?
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 56]: Of course you hope to obtain advancement from his interest , and perhaps , if he becomes more attached to you , he may not forget you when he dies ; but it appears to me that you have something nearer to your heart than all this -- tell me , am I right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: `` You are , my dear mother ; my great end is , that Captain Delmar should acknowledge me as his son . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 25]: `` I fear that he will never do that , Percival ; nor , indeed , do I think you would gain by it .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 40]: When you are more advanced in the world , your parentage may be considered as obscure , but still , being born in wedlock , it will be more respectable than the acknowledgment you would seek from Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 38]: You are not aware of the affronts you may meet with by obtaining what you evidently wish ; and once known as the son of Captain Delmar , you may wish that it was never promulgated . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 49]: `` I was born in wedlock , mother , as you say , and as many others are , who now are peers of the realm , and in virtue of their being born in wedlock , succeed to property to which they would otherwise not be entitled .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 30]: Your shame -LRB- excuse me for using the word -RRB- and my disgrace are equally covered by that wedlock , which is an answer to any accusations of illegitimacy .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 20]: As to affronts , I do not fear them , or ever shall , from those who know me .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 45]: I can defend and protect myself ; but it is a great difference to me to let the world suppose that I am the son of Ben the marine , when I know myself to be the son of the future Lord de Versely .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 36]: I wish to be acknowledged by Captain Delmar in such a way as to convince the world that such is the fact , without the world being able to throw it up in my face .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 28]: That is easily done if Captain Delmar chooses to do it ; and if done as it ought to be done , will lead to my benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 37]: At all events , it will satisfy my pride ; for I feel that I am not the son of your husband , but have blood boiling in my veins which would satisfy the proudest aristocrat .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 43]: I prefer the half relation to that class , such as it is , with all its penalties to being supposed to be the son of the man whom , from prudential motives alone , you took to be your husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 41]: `` Well , Percival , I can not blame you ; and do not you , therefore , blame your mother too much , when you consider that the same feeling was the cause of her becoming your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 21]: `` Far from it my dear mother , '' replied I ; `` only let us now act in concert .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 5]: I require your assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 27]: Allow me to ask you one question -- Have you not realised a sufficient sum of money to enable you to retire from our business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 54]: `` I certainly have , my dear Percival , much more than is necessary for me to live in comfort , and I may say , some little luxury ; but I have thought of you , and for your sake , every year , have continued to add to my profits . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 26]: `` Then , my dear mother , for my sake give up your business as soon as possible ; money is not my object . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 12]: `` Tell me what your reasons are for this demand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 12]: `` My dear mother , I will be candid with you .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 45]: I wish you to retire from business , and leave this place for any distant part of England ; I wish you to change your name , and , in one word , I wish Captain Delmar should believe that you are dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 7]: `` An why so , Percival ?
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 22]: I can not see how that will benefit you ; it was on my account that he took charge of you .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 30]: You are not sure that he may not be severed from you , and who knows but that my supposed death may occasion him to desert you altogether ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 61]: `` You assist my cause , my dear mother , by what you say , if it is on your account that Captain Delmar is my friend ; and if as you say , he might desert me when you are dead , or supposed to be so , it is evident that his motive of action must be fear .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 21]: You have the secret of my birth , which he supposes to be known only to you and to him .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 59]: I am convinced that if you were supposed dead , and that the secret was his own , if he thought that there was no proof whatever against him , he would then not care showing towards me that regard which he is inclined to feel as a father , and which is now checked by his pride .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 17]: Captain Delmar is naturally of a kind and affectionate disposition -- that I am sure of .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 24]: Your memory would do more for me than your existence ever can , and as for the rest , leave that to me .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 44]: At all events , if he should , as I do not believe he will , be inclined to throw me off , I have still his written acknowledgment that I am his son , to make use of in case of necessity .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 15]: Now , my dear mother , you must consent to do as I wish .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 18]: Give up your business as soon as possible , and retire to another part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 20]: When I consider it a proper time to do so , your death shall be made known to him .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 30]: I have no doubt that he will be afloat again in a few months , and when we are out of England I will bide the proper time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 13]: `` But your grandmother , Percival -- must I tell her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 36]: `` No ; tell her only that you intend to retire from business and go away from Chatham ; say that you will in future reside in Devonshire , and ask her to accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 11]: Depend upon it she will be pleased with your intentions .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 31]: As to what we arrange relative to Captain Delmar , say nothing to her -- she hates his very name , and is not likely to talk about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 22]: `` Well , Percival you will allow me till to-morrow to think about it before I give a decided answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 44]: `` Certainly , my dear mother ; I wish you so to do , as I am convinced that you will agree with me ; and I infinitely prefer that you should decide on conviction , than be induced by maternal regard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 16]: As I was well assured , my mother 's decision was favourable to my wishes .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 41]: She consulted with my grandmother , who approved of her intentions , and then it was made public that Mrs Keene intended to retire from business , and that the good-will was to be disposed of along with the stock .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 20]: My aunt Milly and Captain Bridgeman appeared well content that my mother should take the step which she proposed .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 22]: In short , all the family approved of the measure , which is not a very usual circumstance in this world .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: I now employed myself in assisting my mother in her affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 77]: In a month we found a purchaser of the stock and good-will , and when the sum paid was added to my mother 's former accumulations , she found herself possessed of 12,000 pounds in the Three per Cents , the interest of which , 360 pounds , was more than sufficient for her living comfortably in Devonshire , especially as my grandmother had still remaining an income very nearly amounting to 200 pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 33]: In another month everything was arranged , and my mother bade farewell to her sister and all her friends , and left Chatham , after having resided there more than seventeen years .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 39]: Long before my mother had removed from Chatham I received a letter from young Vangilt , announcing his safe arrival in Amsterdam , and enclosing an order to receive the money advanced , from a house in London .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 32]: His letter was very grateful , but , as I had cautioned him , not one word was in it which could implicate me , had it fallen into other hands .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 79]: I may as well here observe , that in the hurry of paying off the ship , Vangilt was never missed , and although it did occur to the commanding officer after he had gone on shore that Mr Vangilt had not been sent to prison , he thought it just as well not to raise a question which might get himself into a scrape ; in short , nothing was thought or said about it by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 32]: A few days before my mother quitted Chatham I went up to London to receive the money , and then went to Portsmouth to repay the portion belonging to Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 27]: I found that Bob had made good use of his time , and that the old smuggler now received him as a suitor to his niece .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 67]: As however , Mary was still very young -- not yet seventeen -- and Bob had acknowledged that he had not laid by much money as yet , the old man had insisted that Bob Cross should get another ship , and try a voyage or two more before he was spliced ; and to this arrangement both the mother and Mary persuaded him to consent .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 33]: I went to call upon them with Bob , and did all I could , without stating what was not true , to give the old man a favourable opinion of Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 81]: I even went so far as to say that if he could not procure another vessel , I was ready to put down a sum of money to assist him ; and so I was ; and had it been requisite , I have no doubt but that my mother would have advanced it ; but Bob , a fine seaman , not yet thirty years old , was always sure of a ship -- that is , a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 28]: To save himself from impressment , Cross had dressed himself in long toggery as a captain of a merchant vessel , and was believed to be such .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 29]: Having satisfied myself that everything went on favourably in that quarter , I again returned to Chatham , that I might escort my mother and grandmother into Devonshire .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 63]: We bade farewell to my aunt and Captain Bridgeman , and set off for London , where we remained a few days at an hotel , and then took the day coach down to Ilfracombe , where my mother had decided upon taking up her future residence , changing her name to Ogilvie , which had been my grandmother 's maiden name .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 33]: Ilfracombe was then a beautiful retired spot , and well suited to my mother from its cheapness : with their joint incomes , my grandmother and she could command anything they wished .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 36]: We soon hired a very pretty little cottage _ ornee _ , ready furnished , as my mother would not furnish a house until she had ascertained whether there were no drawbacks to the locality .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 22]: I ought to observe , that my grandmother now appeared quite as partial to me as she had before been otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 7]: I treated her with great respect .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 37]: Although it was not difficult to obtain a renewal of leave from a guard-ship , after I had remained six weeks with my mother , it was necessary that I should make my appearance at Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 54]: It was arranged that I should take my departure for Portsmouth in three days , when , on reading the Plymouth newspaper , I learnt that the newly-launched frigate Manilla , of 44 guns , was put in commission , and that the Honourable Captain Delmar had come down and hoisted his pennant .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 9]: This , of course , changed my plans .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 14]: I resolved to set off for Plymouth , and wait upon Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 41]: I wrote to Bob Cross , enclosing an order for my chest and bedding on board of the guard-ship at Portsmouth , acquainting him with my intention , but requesting him not to act until he heard from me again .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 26]: I had a long conversation with my mother , from whom I obtained a renewal of her promise to abide and act by my instructions .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 38]: I took a respectful farewell of my grandmother , who gave me 100 pounds , which I did not want , as my mother had given me a similar sum , and then set off for Plymouth .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 38]: The reader may perhaps inquire how it was that Captain Delmar -- as he had promised to pay my expenses -- had not made any offer of the kind , or communicated with me on the subject ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 39]: But the fact was , that he knew I had three years ' pay due , besides the prize-money for the Dutch frigate , which , however , I had not yet received , although it was payable .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 49]: In pecuniary matters I was certainly well off , as my mother desired that I would draw for any money that I required , feeling convinced that , being aware of her circumstances , I should not distress her by any extravagancies in that she did me justice .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 15]: I was now eighteen years old , and just starting again on my career .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 16]: As I grew up , my likeness to Captain Delmar became more remarkable every day .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 11]: My mother could not help observing it even to me .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 14]: `` I almost wish that it was not so , my dear mother .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 20]: I fear it will be the cause of annoyance to Captain Delmar ; but it can not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 33]: At all events , it must satisfy him , allowing that he has any doubt -LRB- which I am sure he has not -RRB- , that I am his own child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 18]: `` That I believe to be quite unnecessary , '' replied my mother with a deep sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 19]: `` I should think so too , my dear mother , '' replied I , caressing her kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 42]: `` At all events , I will prove , whether I ever obtain it or not , that I am not unworthy of the name of Delmar : but I must wait no longer -- the coach is about to start .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 9]: Adieu , and may God bless you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 29]: On my arrival at Plymouth -- or Plymouth Dock , as Devonport was then called -- I inquired at which hotel Captain Delmar had taken up his quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 56]: It was the one to which I had intended to have gone myself ; but I immediately had my luggage taken to another , for I really believe that Delmar would have considered it a great liberty for any one of his officers to presume , to lie down in the same caravanserai as himself .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 12]: The next morning I sent up my name and was admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 12]: `` Good morning , Mr Keene , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 25]: `` I presume that you have come down to request to join my ship , and I therefore consent before you make the request .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 21]: I trust you will always show the same zeal and deference to your officers that you did in the Calliope .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 13]: You have grown very much , and are now a young man .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 22]: I shall give you the rating of mate , and I trust you will not do discredit to my patronage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 36]: `` I trust not , Captain Delmar , '' replied I. `` I have but one wish in the world , which is to please you , who have so befriended me from my boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 39]: I should be very ungrateful if I did not do my duty with zeal and fidelity ; I am indebted to you for everything , and I am aware I must look to you for every future prospect .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 22]: I have to thank you , sir , for your great kindness in publishing my name in the public Gazette . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 25]: `` You deserved it , Mr Keene , and it certainly will be of great advantage to you when you have served your time .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 13]: Has your time gone on since the Calliope was paid off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 16]: `` Yes , sir ; I am still on the books of the Salvadore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 9]: `` How much time have you served ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 11]: `` Nearly four years and a half , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 25]: `` Well , the rest will soon be over ; and if you do your duty , my patronage shall not be wanting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 37]: Here there was a bow on my part , and a pause , and I was backing out with another bow , when the captain said , `` How is your mother , Mr Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 52]: `` She has been advised to retire from business , and to settle in the country , '' replied I , mournfully ; `` her health is such , that -- '' Here I stopped , as I preferred deceiving him by implication , or rather allowing him to deceive himself .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 24]: `` I am sorry to hear that , '' replied he ; `` but she never was strong as a young woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 13]: Here the captain stopped , as if he had said too much .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 29]: `` No , sir , '' replied I ; `` when in the service of Mrs Delmar she could not be put to anything that required fatigue . ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 9]: `` Very true , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 30]: `` You may go on board , Mr Keene , and desire my clerk to make out a letter , requesting your discharge from the Salvadore into the Manilla .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 6]: Do you require anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 9]: `` No , sir , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 10]: I need not trespass on your generosity just now .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 6]: Good morning , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 8]: `` Good morning , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 39]: `` I beg your pardon Captain Delmar , '' said I , as I held the door ajar ; `` but should you like Robert Cross , your former coxswain , should join you in the same capacity ?
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 7]: I know where he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 21]: `` Yes , Mr Keene , I should like to have him : he was a steady , good man .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 16]: You will oblige me by writing to him , and requesting him to join immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 5]: Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 8]: `` At Portsmouth , Captain Delmar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 15]: `` Very well ; tell him to come round as fast as he can .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 23]: By the bye , you will have two of your old messmates -- Mr Smith , the master , and Mr Dott .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 13]: I hope the latter is a little more steady than he was .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 35]: I was in hopes to have had your old acquaintance , Mr Culpepper , with us ; but he died about six weeks back -- a fit , or something of that kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 22]: `` Thank heaven for that , '' thought I. Again I made my most respectful bow , and quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 19]: I returned to my own hotel , and sitting down , I began to reflect upon the interview .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 97]: I recalled all that had passed , and I made up my mind that I was right in preparing him for the report of my mother 's death : his reception of me was all that I could have expected from him -- it was cordial ; but my blood boiled when I called to mind that he had only made a casual inquiry after my mother , as I was leaving the room ; and then his checking himself because he had inadvertently said that she was not strong when she was a young woman .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 73]: `` Yes , '' thought I ; `` he can not bear the remembrance of the connection ; and it is only for myself , and not from any natural affection of a parent , that he cares for me ; or if he does care for me as his son , it is because I have his blood in my veins ; and he despises and looks down upon the mother .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 24]: I am sure that he will be anything but sorry to hear that my mother is dead , and he shall be gratified .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 8]: I will now write to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 17]: I could not help observing that there was some change in the appearance of Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 40]: Strange to say , he looked more youthful ; and as I compared our two faces in the mirror on the mantel-piece behind him , when I stood up , he appeared more like me in appearance than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 8]: thought I , `` I have it .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 16]: His hair is no longer mixed with grey : he must wear a wig . ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 26]: This was the fact , as I afterwards ascertained ; the colour of his wig was , however , much darker than my own hair .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 38]: By the same post I wrote to Bob Cross , acquainting him with what had passed , and begging him to come round by the first water conveyance , and bring my chest and bedding with him .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 43]: I then walked down to the dockyard to have a look at the Manilla , which was , as I had heard , a splendid vessel ; went up again to order a mate 's uniform , and returned to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 55]: It was useless going to the ship at that time , as the marines and boys had only been drafted into her that morning ; and there was nothing to do until she was clear of the shipwrights , who were still on board of her , and employed in every part of her .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 9]: The first lieutenant had not yet come down .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 17]: The master was the only officer who had joined , and he had hoisted the pennant .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 20]: I was delighted to find that he was to sail with us ; and we passed that evening together .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 25]: During the evening the master said , `` I hear there are plenty of good men stowed away by the crimps at different places .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 17]: I wish we could only find out where they are , and get hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 32]: I fear , if we do not , we shall either be badly manned in haste from the Tower tender , or have to wait a long while before we sail .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 20]: Now , Keene , do n't you think you could manage so as to get us some men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: `` I 've got one already , '' replied I : `` Bob Cross , the captain 's coxswain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 23]: `` And a real good one too , '' replied the master ; `` the best helmsman we had in the Calliope .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 9]: You and he were very thick together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 36]: `` Yes , '' replied I : `` when I came on board , a mere lad , he was very kind to me , and I am very partial to him in consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 59]: That night after the master and I had parted , I thought over the question he had put to me , as to obtaining good seamen for the ship , and I made up my mind that I would wait till Cross arrived , and consult with him as to a project which I had in my head .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 39]: In the mean time I went to a slop-shop by the dockyard wall , and provided myself with a common sailor 's toggery , of the real cut , with a banyan covered hat , and all complete .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 40]: Three days afterwards Cross joined me , having found a passage round in a cutter ; and as soon as I had talked over his affairs , I proposed my plan to him , in which he heartily coincided .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 17]: That I did this to please the captain is certain : I had no other view .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 24]: It was necessary , however , that I obtained the captain 's permission , and I went to him and explained my ideas .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 18]: The captain was too willing to let me try it , and thanked me for my zeal .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 32]: `` Go on board , Mr Keene , and tell them I have given you six weeks ' leave of absence , and then you can do as you propose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 30]: I did so , for it was absolutely necessary that as few as possible should be acquainted with what I was about , as I ran a great risk .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 23]: I have no hesitation in saying that I should have been made away with by the crimps , had they discovered me .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 71]: I dressed myself as a common seaman , darkened my face , and dirtied myself a little , especially on the hands , and Bob Cross and I then went at night into one of the low public houses , with which the town is filled ; there we pretended to be much alarmed lest we should be pressed , and asked for a back-room to smoke and drink in .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 67]: We called in the landlord , telling him we were second mates of vessels , and not secure from the impress ; that we never were at Plymouth before , our ships having put in damaged , and that the crew were discharged ; and asked if there was no safe place where we could be stowed until we could find another vessel ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 63]: He replied , that there was a house at Stonehouse where we could be quite safe ; but that , of course , we must pay the crimps well for our board and lodging and that they would find us a ship when we wished to go ; and further , that we must give him something handsome for taking us there .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 41]: To this we agreed , and at midnight we set off in company with our landlord , each of us carrying our bundles , and in less than an hour arrived at a sort of farm-house detached from the road .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 35]: After a short parley we obtained entrance , and were taken into a small room where the crimp inquired of us what money we had , and then told us what his charges were .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 98]: The reason of his doing this was , because if we had no money , or very little , he would have disposed of us very soon by sending us on board of some ship , and obtaining an advance of our wages from the captain as his indemnification ; but if we had plenty of money , he would then keep us as long as he could that he might make his profit of us ; his charges were monstrous , as may be supposed , and we had replied that we had very little money .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 61]: We contrived to look as careless and indifferent as we could , agreed to everything , paid the landlord of the pothouse a guinea each for taking us to the house , and were then ushered into a large room , where we found about twenty seamen sitting at a long table , drinking , and playing cards and dominoes .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 18]: They did not appear to notice us , they were so busy either playing or looking on .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 20]: Cross called for a pot of ale , and we sat down at the farther end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 31]: `` What a dislike the men must have to the press , '' said Cross to me , `` when they submit to be mured up here in prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 17]: `` Yes , and cheated by such a scoundrel as the crimp appears to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 31]: `` Do n't talk so loud , Jack , '' replied Cross ; for I had insisted upon his calling me Jack , `` lest we should be overheard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 25]: We then asked to go to bed , and were shown by the crimp into a room which had about fourteen beds in it .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 33]: `` You may take your choice of those five , '' said he , pointing to five nearest the door : `` I always come up and take away the candle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 22]: As we found some of the other beds occupied , we did not resume our conversation , but went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 25]: The next morning we found that we mustered about thirty-five , many of the more steady men having gone to bed before we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 20]: After breakfast , Cross and I each entered into conversation with a man , and pumped them very cleverly .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 66]: Our chief object was , to ascertain the houses of the other crimps , and , as the men knew most of them , having invariably resorted to them at the end of their voyages , we obtained the locality of five or six , all apparently public-houses , but having back premises for the concealment of seamen : all these were carefully noted down .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 25]: As we became more intimate , the seamen , who were glad to talk , from weariness of confinement , asked us many questions .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 23]: We said that we had deserted from a man-of-war , and then a hundred questions were asked us as to our treatment .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 15]: I allowed Bob Cross to be spokesman , and his replies were very sensible .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 59]: He told them that all depended upon what sort of captains and first lieutenants were on board ; that he had been pressed twice : the first time he was comfortable enough , and made 200 pounds prize-money in eight months ; but in the last man-of-war he was very uncomfortable , and had therefore cut and run .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 35]: Altogether , he made the service appear much more favourable than they supposed , although the crimp , who had stood by , did all he could to persuade the men to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 27]: We remained in this house for more than a week , and then declared that we had no more money , and must find a ship .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 41]: The crimp said that he had a berth for one of us as second mate of a brig , and I agreed to take it , leaving Bob Cross to get a berth for himself as soon as he could .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 46]: As I raid up , there was no demand upon the owners of the vessel , and it was arranged that I should be down at a certain wharf at three o'clock in the morning , when I should find a boat waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 21]: I waited up with Bob Cross until the clock had struck two , and then the crimp let me out .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 41]: He did not offer to go down with me , as he had no money to receive ; and , as it was pitch-dark , there was little chance of my being picked up by a press-gang at that hour .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 18]: I wished Cross good-bye , and set off for Plymouth Dock with my bundle on my stick .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 64]: Not knowing where to go at such an hour , I walked about to see if I could perceive a light in any house : I did so at last through the chinks of the shutters of a small ale-house , and tapped at the door ; it was opened , I was ushered in , and the door closed immediately upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 18]: I found myself in the presence of several marines with their side-arms , and seamen with cutlasses .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 22]: An officer started up from his seat , and collaring me said , `` You 're just the fellow we want .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 7]: We 're in luck to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 18]: In fact , I was in the hands of a press-gang , and I was pressed myself .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 25]: `` Yes , he 'll do : he 'll make a capital maintop-man , '' said a midshipman , getting up and surveying me .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 29]: I looked at him , and perceived my old acquaintance Mr Tommy Dott , grown a great deal taller ; I perceived that he did not recognise me .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 37]: `` But , sir , '' said I to the officer of the party , who was so disguised that I could not tell his rank , `` suppose I belong to a man-of-war already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 30]: `` That you do not ; or if you do , you must be a deserter , my good fellow ; that is evident by your stick and bundle .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 44]: Now sit down and drink some beer , if you like ; you are going to serve in a fine frigate -- you may as well make yourself comfortable , for we shall not go on board yet , for this hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 15]: I determined to keep up my _ incognito _ , as it amused me .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 42]: I sat down , and it then occurred to me that my not going on board of the vessel might lead to an explanation with the crimp , and that an alarm might be created and the men dispersed in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 32]: There were still two hours to daylight , and if I could take up the press-gang , we might secure all the men in the house before the dawn of day .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 25]: As I had just made up my mind to act , there was a stamping of feet outside and a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 18]: When it was opened , another portion of the press-gang , headed by another officer , entered .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 27]: I counted heads , and found that they mustered thirty hands -- quite sufficient , as they were armed , to secure all my late companions .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 16]: I therefore went up to the officer , and begged to speak with him aside .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 59]: I then told him that I had just come from a crimp 's house near Stonehouse , where I left in their beds thirty-five as fine men as ever walked a plank , and that , as I was pressed myself , I did not mind telling him where they were , and he could take them all .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 32]: The officer curled up his lip , as if to say , `` You 're a pretty scoundrel to betray your companions , '' but immediately resolved to act upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 33]: Without stating his intentions , he ordered all the men out , and putting me between two marines , so as to prevent my escaping , I was desired to lead on .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 17]: I did so , and we proceeded in silence until we arrived near to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 43]: I then pointed out to the officer that it must be surrounded , or the men would escape , and that it must be done very carefully , as there was a large dog which would be sure to give the alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 24]: My advice was attended to , and when all the men were at their stations , the whole advanced slowly towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 31]: The dog commenced baying , as I had foreseen , and shortly afterwards the crimp put his head out of a window , and perceived that the press-gang were below .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 25]: But all attempts to force an entrance were in vain , every window below , and the doors , being secured with iron bars .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 12]: `` Is there no way of getting into this den ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: said the officer to me .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 9]: `` Why sir , I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 43]: As Bob Cross had given another name , I knew that I risked nothing in calling out his , and I therefore requested the officer to impose silence , and when it was obtained , I cried out , `` Bob Cross !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: Bob Cross !! Where 's Bob Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 31]: After that , I went to the small door at the side of the house , which led to the homestead , and again cried out , `` Bob Cross !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 7]: -- where 's Bob Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 26]: I then told the officer that we must wait patiently , and that if it was daylight before we got in , all the better .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 43]: About ten minutes after that , as I remained at the small door , I heard the bars quietly removed ; I then requested the officer to attempt to force the small door , and it yielded almost immediately to their efforts .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 53]: `` Now , sir , leave a guard at the other door , that they may not open it , and escape by it , also five or six hands to catch any who may jump out of the upper windows , and then enter with the rest of your party . ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 53]: `` You know what you are about , at all events , '' said he , giving the directions which I had pointed out , and then entering with the remainder of his party , with the exception of one marine that held me by the arm , with his bayonet drawn .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 60]: The scuffle within was very severe , and lasted for many minutes : at last , the armed force , although not so numerous , prevailed , and one by one , the men were brought out , and taken charge of by the marines , until the whole of them were discovered in their retreats , and secured .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 12]: Day now dawned , and it was time to be off .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 25]: To make more secure , the pressed men were lashed two and two , with small rope , which had been provided on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 74]: Bob Cross , who , of course , had not mixed in the affray , gave me a nod of recognition , and we set off as fast as the men could be persuaded to move ; certainly not a very gay procession , for although the wounds were not dangerous , there was scarcely one of the party , amounting in all to upwards of sixty men , who was not bleeding .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 6]: Hardly a word was exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 46]: We were all put into the boats , and rowed off to the hulk appropriated to the crew of the frigate , until she was rigged , and as soon as we were on board , we were put below under the charge of sentries .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 4]: you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 7]: said some of the pressed men .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' replied I : `` they picked me up as I went to ship myself last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 17]: The crimp , who had been brought on board with the others , then started forward .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 17]: `` It is he who has blown upon us ; I 'll swear to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 26]: `` You may swear if you please , '' replied I ; `` that will do you no good , and me no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 16]: The crimp talked with the other men , and then indignation was levelled against me .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 63]: Most of them swore they would be even with me , and have my life if they could ; indeed , they could hardly be prevented laying hands upon me ; but Bob Cross told the sentry , and he interfered with his bayonet ; notwithstanding which , fists continued to be shook in my face , and vengeance threatened every minute .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 67]: `` I told you , my lads , '' said Bob Cross , `` that I have been on board of a man-of-war before this , and you 'd better mind what you 're about , or you 'll repent it ; at all events , if one of you touches him , you 'll have five dozen lashes at the gangway before to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 22]: This made the poor fellows more quiet ; most of them lay down , and tried to sleep off their misery .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 13]: `` Why do n't you make yourself known , Mr Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 22]: said Cross to me , in a whisper : `` I saw the master go on the quarterdeck just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 44]: `` I think I had better not : there are more houses to examine , and if my trick was known , it would soon get wind from the women , and I should be waylaid , and perhaps murdered by the crimps .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 29]: The captain will be on board by ten o'clock , I have no doubt , and then I will contrive to see him , somehow or another . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 14]: `` But you could trust the master -- why not see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 14]: `` I 'll think of it -- but there 's no hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 24]: I was afraid that Tommy Dott would have discovered me , and I kept out of his way as much as I could .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 45]: `` I 'll tell you what , sir -- as I 've not joined the ship , why not let it be supposed that I am impressed with the other men , and then I can send for Mr Dott and make myself known ?
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 40]: The commanding officer will , of course , send for me , and I will enter , and then I shall be allowed to go about , and can speak to the captain when he comes on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 10]: `` Well , that is not a bad idea .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 6]: Talk to the sentry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 12]: `` Who 's the captain of this ship , sentry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 4]: said Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 5]: `` Captain Delmar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 3]: `` Delmar !
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 9]: -- why , he 's my old captain .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 12]: Did not I see a Mr Dott , a midshipman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 11]: `` Yes there is a Mr Dott on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 30]: `` Well , I wish you would just pass the word to Mr Dott , to say that one of the pressed men wishes to speak to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 11]: The sentry did so , and Mr Dott came down .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 9]: `` How d'ye do , Mr Dott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 9]: said Bob Cross , while I turned away .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 8]: `` What Cross , is that you ?
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 5]: Are you dressed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 12]: I 'm glad I 'm to sail with you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 8]: What 's become of Mr Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 29]: `` Oh , I do n't know ; but if he 's not hanged by this time , I believe that he 's to join the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 11]: `` Wo n't I pull your ears for that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 15]: thought I. `` What other officers have we of the Calliope , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 14]: `` There 's the master , Mr Smith , and the surgeon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 15]: `` Well , Mr Dott , one must always make a virtue of necessity .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 29]: Tell Mr Smith that I shall enter for the ship ; and I 'll put my name down at once , instead of being penned up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 22]: `` That 's right , Cross ; and I say , you chaps , you 'd better follow a good example .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 10]: Sentry , let this man go with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 14]: Bob Cross then went with Tommy Dott , and entered for the service .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 30]: The master was very glad to see him again and said , `` Why , Cross , Mr Keene said that you had promised him to join us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 16]: `` Why , sir , so I had ; but it 's a long story .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 26]: However , it 's all the same in the end : here I am , and I hope I shall get my old rating . ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 31]: Soon after , Bob Cross came down and said , `` Well , my lads , I 'm free now , and I advise you all to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 16]: Come , Jack , '' said he to me , `` what d'ye say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 19]: `` No , no , '' replied I. `` I wo n't unless all the rest do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 27]: Bob then took me on one side , and told me what had taken place , and asked me what he should say to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 10]: I told him , and then he left us .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 9]: At ten o'clock the captain came on board .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 19]: Bob Cross went up to him and said he wished to say something to him in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 71]: He followed the captain down , and then explained to him that I was among the pressed men but as a means of obtaining plenty more men , I had remained among them , and had not made myself known , for fear my trick should get wind ; also that I thought the crimp should be kept on board , although he was of no use as a seaman .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 13]: `` Mr Keene has behaved very prudently , '' replied Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 13]: `` I understand his motives -- leave the rest to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 28]: A few minutes after Bob had communicated to me what the captain had said , the pressed men were ordered up , and ranged along the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 26]: A finer set of men I never saw together : and they all appeared to be , as they afterwards proved to be prime seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: The captain called them one by one and questioned them .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 10]: He asked them to enter , but they refused .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 8]: The crimp begged hard to be released .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 13]: Their names were all put down on the ship 's book together .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 42]: The captain , turning to me -- for I had stood up the last of the row -- said , `` I understand the officer of the impress agreed to release you if you would tell him where your comrades were .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 24]: I do n't like losing a good man , but still I shall let you go in consequence of the promise being made .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 13]: There , you may take a boat and go on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 51]: `` Thank your honour , '' replied I. I went to the gangway immediately ; but I never shall forget the faces of the pressed men when I passed them : they looked as if I had a thousand lives , and they had stomach enough to take them all .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 39]: I went on shore immediately , and going to my hotel , washed the colour and dirt off my face , dressed myself in my mate 's uniform , and went to the hotel where the captain lived .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 22]: I found that he had just come on shore , and I sent up my name , and I was admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 36]: I then told the captain the information which we had received with regard to nine or ten more houses , and that I thought I might now go on board , and never be recognised .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 49]: `` You have managed extremely well , '' replied Captain Delmar ; `` we have made a glorious haul : but I think it will be better that you do not go on board ; the press-gang shall meet you every night , and obey your orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 10]: I bowed , and walked out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 39]: The next night , and several subsequent ones , the press-gang came on shore , and , from the information I had received , we procured in the course of a fortnight more than two hundred good seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 72]: Some of the defences were most desperate : fort as one crimp 's house after another was forced , they could not imagine how they could have been discovered ; but it put them all on their guard ; and on the last three occasions the merchant seamen were armed and gave us obstinate fights ; however , although the wounds were occasionally severe , there was no loss of life .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 41]: Having expended all my knowledge , I had nothing more to do than go on board , which I did , and was kindly received by the master and the other officers , who had been prepossessed in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: Such was the successful result of my plan .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 136]: The crimp we did not allow to go on shore , but discharged him into a gun-brig , the captain of which was a notorious martinet ; and I have no doubt , being aware of his character and occupation , that he kept his word , when he told Captain Delmar that he would make the ship a hell to him -- `` and sarve him right too , '' said Bob Cross , when he heard of it ; `` the money that these rascals obtain from the seamen , Mr Keene , is quite terrible ; and the poor fellows , after having earned it by two or three years ' hard work , go to prison in a crimp-house to spend it , or rather to be swindled out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 42]: It is these fellows that raise such reports against the English navy , that frighten the poor fellows so ; they hear of men being flogged until they die under the lash , and all the lies that can be invented .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 48]: Not that the masters of the merchant vessels are at all backward in disparaging the service , but threaten to send a man on board a man-of-war for a punishment , if he behaves ill -- that itself is enough to raise a prejudice against the service .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 35]: Now , sir , I can safely swear that there is more cruelty and oppression -- more ill-treatment and more hard work -- on board of a merchantman , than on board any man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 3]: Why so ?
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 32]: Because there is no control over the master of a merchant vessel , while the captain of a man-of-war is bound down by strict regulations , which he dare not disobey .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 78]: We see many reports in the newspapers of the ill-treatment on of merchant vessels ; but for one that is made known , ninety-nine are passed over ; for a seaman has something else to do than to be kicking his heels at a magistrate 's office ; and when he gets clear of his vessel , with his pay in his pocket , he prefers to make merry and forget his treatment , to seeking revenge .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 31]: I say again , sarve that crimp right , and I hope that he 'll get a lash for every pound which he has robbed from the poor seamen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 90]: I may as well inform the reader that , as it is mostly the case after the men have been impressed , nearly the whole of them entered the service ; and when , some time afterwards , they ascertained that it was I that had tricked them , so far from feeling the ill-will towards me that they had on their first coming on board , they laughed very much at my successful plan , and were more partial to me than to any other of the officers .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 13]: Our frigate was now well manned , and nearly ready for sea .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 42]: I wrote to my mother , enclosing the heads of a letter to her which she should send to Captain Delmar , and in a day or two I received an answer , with a copy of what she had sent .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 107]: It was to the effect that I was now going away for the second time , and that it was possible she might never see me or Captain Delmar again ; that she wished him success and happiness , and begged him , in case she should be called away , not to forget his promises to her , or what she had undergone for his sake ; but she trusted entirely to him , and that he would watch over me and my interests , even more out of regard to her memory , than if she were alive to support my claims upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 22]: The letter was given to Captain Delmar when he was on the quarter-deck , and he went with it down below .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 7]: He came on deck shortly afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 22]: I looked at him but did not perceive that he was in any way put out or moved by its reception .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 51]: Claims for past services , whether upon the country or upon individuals , are seldom well received ; like the payment of a tavern bill , after we have done with the enjoyments , we seem inclined to cavil at each separate item -- _ ainsi va le monde _ .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 26]: It was reported down at Mutton Cove , that our ship , which sailed with sealed orders was to be sent to the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 19]: This the captain did not expect or wish , as he had had enough of the tropics already .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 37]: When he , however , opened his orders , it was found that Mutton Cove was correct , and the captain 's instructions were , to seek the admiral of the station with all possible dispatch .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 45]: We carried sail day and night , and as the Manilla proved a remarkably fast sailer , we were very soon in Carlisle Bay , Barbadoes , where we found the admiral and six sail of the line , and a few smaller vessels .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 56]: As soon as the despatches were opened by the admiral , our signal , as well as that of all the smaller vessels , was made , and before the evening we had spread our canvas in every direction , being sent to recall the whole of the disposable force to rendezvous at Carlisle Bay .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 18]: We knew that something was in the wind , but what , we had no idea of .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 15]: Our orders were to proceed to Halifax , and we had a quick passage .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 30]: We found two frigates there , and we gave them their instructions ; and then , having remained only twenty-four hours , we all made sail together for Barbadoes .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 28]: On our arrival there , we round the bay crowded with vessels : twenty-eight sail of pennants and a fleet of transports , containing ten thousand troops .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 40]: Three days afterwards the signal was made to weigh , and the whole fleet stood out from Carlisle Bay , it being now well known that the capture of the island of Martinique was the object of the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 26]: On the third day we arrived off the island , and our troops were disembarked at two points , expecting to meet with strong opposition .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 13]: Such , however , to our surprise , was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 72]: It appeared that the militia of the island , being composed of slaves , and who were sent to oppose us , did not consider that slavery was worth fighting for quite as well as liberty , and therefore very quietly walked home again , leaving the governor and regular troops to decide the question as to whether the island was for the future to belong to the French or English .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 24]: But the two following days there was some hard fighting , and our troops , although they advanced , had a severe loss .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 22]: The French retired from the advanced posts to Fort Dessaix , and we obtained possession of the fort on Point Salamon .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 56]: The next point to be attacked was Pigeon Island , and there the navy were called into action ; we had to get the carronades and mortars up a hill almost inaccessible ; we did it , much to the surprise of the troops , who could hardly believe it when the battery opened fire .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 50]: After a brisk cannonading of ten hours , Pigeon Island surrendered , and then the admiral stood into , and anchored the fleet in Fort Royal Bay ; not , however , in time to prevent the French from setting fire to the frigates which were in the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 25]: A few days after , the town of St. Pierre and the town of Fort Royal surrendered , and Fort Dessaix only held out .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 48]: For more than a week we were very busy constructing batteries and landing cannon and mortars ; and when all was ready , the bombardment of Fort Dessaix commenced , and five days afterwards the French capitulated , and the island was formally surrendered to the English .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 16]: I have hurried over the capture , as it has oftentimes been described in detail .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 49]: All I can say is , that it was very hard work for the seamen , and that they had their full share of the fatigue ; but , from the peculiar nature of the service , an affair took place which was of much importance to me .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 55]: I said before that the sailors were employed in the hard duty of getting the guns , etcetera , on shore , and up to where the batteries were to be erected -- in short , working like slaves in the heat of the sun , while the troops remained quiet investing the fort .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 63]: There was no objection raised to this , and the seamen worked very willingly ; but the staff and mounted officers of the army , who rode to and fro giving orders , were not quite as civil as they might be -- that is , some of them ; and a certain feeling of dissension and ill-will was created in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 59]: The junior officers of the navy , and the lieutenants who could be spared to direct the labour of the seamen on shore , received occasionally very harsh language from some of the military officers , and did not fail to give very prompt replies to those who they did not consider had any right to control them .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 36]: Complaints were made to the captains of the men-of-war , and , on being investigated , the result generally was , that the captains defended their officers , and the military gentlemen obtained no redress .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 33]: The active service , however , did not admit of any notice being taken of it at the time ; but after the island had surrendered , these unfortunate animosities were resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 33]: A few days after the capture of the island , the prisoners and troops were embarked an the fleet sailed , a sufficient garrison being left upon the island for its defence .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 21]: The admiral also thought proper to leave two or three men-of-war in the harbour , and our frigate was one .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 10]: For the first few days everything went on smoothly .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 50]: The French inhabitants were soon on good terms with us , and balls and parties had commenced ; but the seamen and soldiers , when they met at the liquor-stores , began to quarrel as to which branch of the service had done most towards the taking the island .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 13]: This will always be the case with people so addicted to intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 25]: Several severe wounds were received in the various skirmishes which took place , and at last the seamen were interdicted from going on shore .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 41]: Indeed , as they were not armed , and the soldiers carried their bayonets , it was too unequal a contest when an affray took place ; but the ill-will spread , and at last arrived to the superior officers .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 21]: The consequence was , that a challenge was given to one of the captains of the frigates by an adjutant .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 67]: It was accepted ; but not an hour after it was accepted , the captain was taken with a fever , and on the morning of the following day , when the duel was to have taken place , he was not able to quit his bed ; and the military gentlemen , on arriving at the ground , found an excuse instead of an antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 98]: Whether it was really supposed that the fever was a mere excuse to avoid the duel , or that the animosity prevailing gave rise to the report , certain it is , that there were many sneers on the part of the military men , and great indignation on the tart of the naval officers ; who , if they could have so done , would have gone on shore on purpose to insult every officer they could meet who wore a red coat ; but in consequence of this excitement being known all leave was prohibited .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 84]: Captain Delmar , who was the naval commanding officer , had taken up his quarters on shore ; he had done all he possibly could to prevent the unpleasant feeling from continuing , and had shown great forbearance and good sense : but it so happened that , being in company with some of the military staff , observations were made in his presence , relative to the conduct of the naval captain ill with the fever , that he could not permit .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 25]: He gave a flat denial to them , and the consequence was , that language was used which left no alternative but a duel .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 30]: This was the Monday night , and as it was too late then , it was agreed that the meeting should take place on the following evening at sunset .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 44]: I believe this was proposed by Captain Delmar , in preference to the morning , as he knew his antagonist was a regular duellist and he wished to have the next day to put his affairs in order , previous to the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 19]: I should here observe that the captain had not been on anything like intimate terms with his lieutenants .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 105]: The surgeon and master were old shipmates , and with them he was sociable : whether it was that he did not choose to ask the favour of the commissioned officers , certain it is , that he sent for the master to be his second on the occasion , and on the master returning on board , he desired me to go on shore with the boat and take the captain 's pistols with me , but not to allow them to be seen by any one ; a message was also sent for the surgeon to go on shore to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 24]: When the surgeon and I arrived at the house where the captain resided , and were ushered up , the sitting-room was empty .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 39]: I had put the case of pistols in a piece of canvas , so as to look like despatches about to be sent to England , and I uncovered them and placed them on one of the tables .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 37]: A few minutes afterwards the captain came out , and I was very much surprised at his appearance ; he was very flushed and heated in the face , and appeared to tremble as he walked .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 9]: The surgeon also looked at him with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 23]: We knew him to be incapable of fear , and yet he gave us the appearance of a person very much troubled .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 16]: `` Doctor , '' said he , `` I am glad that you are come .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 10]: I feel very unwell -- feel my pulse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 29]: `` Yes , sir , '' said the doctor , `` that you certainly are ; you have the same fever on you as Captain W. Singular . ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 13]: `` Yes , but it will be rather too singular , doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 40]: Poor W had obloquy enough on account of his illness ; and if a second captain in the navy were to be obliged to send a similar excuse , we should be at a pretty discount with the red-coats .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 34]: If you can do any thing for me , do ; but it must be perfectly understood that fight to-morrow evening I will , even if I am carried to the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 11]: `` Certainly , Captain Delmar , if it is possible .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 21]: I think that a little blood must be taken from you immediately , and probably the fever may subside . ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 54]: But before his arm could be bound up , the captain became incoherent in his discourse ; and after the bleeding had been performed , when he attempted to look at his papers , he was so confused that he found it impossible , and was obliged to be put to bed immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 52]: When the surgeon came out of his bed-room , he said to us , `` He 'll never get up to fight that duel , depend upon it ; the fever increases -- it may be that he may never rise again -- I fear it is the yellow fever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 34]: `` A bad job , '' replied the master -- `` a very bad job indeed ; two captains in the navy receiving challenges , and both sending excuses on account of illness .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 6]: The service will be disgraced .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 8]: I 'll fight the soldier myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 30]: `` That will never do , '' replied the surgeon ; `` it will not help the captain that he has sent one of his officers in his stead .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 20]: Steward , make a bed up here in this room ; I shall not leave the house to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 37]: `` It 's of no use my staying here , '' observed the master : `` nor you either , Keene : let 's go on board , and we will be here early to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 5]: Confounded bad job this .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 9]: The master and I returned to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 51]: I had been reflecting a good deal on the disgrace which would , at all events for a certain period , be thrown upon the service and Captain Delmar by this unfortunate circumstance , and before I had gone up the ship 's side I had made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 71]: As soon as we were on board , I requested the master to allow me to speak to him in his cabin ; and when we were there , after canvassing the question , and pointing out to him what discredit would ensue , and working him up into a great state of irritation , I then proposed to him what I considered to be the best course to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 38]: `` Every one says how like I am to Captain Delmar , Mr Smith , '' said I. `` If you were his own son , you could not be more so , '' replied the master .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 31]: `` Well , sir , I am now as tall as he is : the colour of my hair is lighter , certainly ; but the captain wears a wig .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 69]: Now , sir , I am perfectly sure that if I were to put on the captain 's uniform and wig , as the duel is to take place in the evening , they never could find out that it was not the captain ; and as for a good shot , I think I can hit a button as well as the best duellist in existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 14]: The master bit his lips , and was silent for a short time .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 26]: At last he said , `` What you propose is certainly very easy ; but why should you risk your life for Captain Delmar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 19]: `` Why , did you not offer to do it just now for the honour of the service ?
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 19]: I have that feeling , and moreover wish to serve Captain Delmar , who has been my patron .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 16]: What 's the life of a midshipman worth , even if I were to fall ?
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 4]: -- nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 38]: `` That 's true enough , '' replied the master bluntly ; and then correcting himself , he added , `` that is , midshipmen in general ; but I think you may be worth something by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 36]: However , Keene , I do think , on the whole , it 's a very good plan ; and if the Captain is not better to-morrow , we will then consider it more seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 42]: I have an idea that you are more likely to pin the fellow than the captain , who , although as brave a man as can be , he has not , I believe , fired twenty pistols in his life .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 15]: Good night ; and I hardly need say we must keep our secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 6]: `` Never fear , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 19]: I went to my hammock , quite overjoyed at the half-consent given by the master to my proposition .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 42]: It would give me such a claim on Captain Delmar , if I survived ; and if I fell , at all events he would cherish my memory ; but as for falling , I felt sure that I should not .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 22]: I had a presentiment -LRB- probably no more than the buoyant hope of youth -RRB- that I should be the victor .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 28]: At all events , I went to sleep very soundly , and did not wake until I was roused up by the quartermaster on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 17]: After breakfast the master requested a boat to be manned , and we went on shore .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 32]: On our arrival at the house , we found the surgeon in great anxiety : the captain was in a state of delirium , and the fever was at the highest .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 6]: `` How is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 4]: demanded the master .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 23]: `` More likely to go out of the world himself than to send another out of it , '' replied the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 17]: `` He can not well be worse , and that is all that I can say .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 44]: He has been raving all night , and I have been obliged to take nearly two pounds of blood from him ; and , Mr Keene , '' continued the surgeon , `` he talks a great deal of you and other persons .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 28]: You may go in to him , if you please ; for I have as much as possible kept the servants away -- they will talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 25]: `` Bob Cross is down below , sir , '' replied I : `` he is the safest man to wait upon him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 21]: `` I agree with you , Keene -- send for him , and he shall remain at his bedside . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 84]: The master then spoke with the surgeon , and communicated my proposition ; and the surgeon replied , `` Well , from what I have learned this night , there is no person who has so great a right to take his place ; and perhaps it will be as well , both for the captain 's sake and his own ; at all events , I will go with you , and , in case of accident , do my best . ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 19]: The matter was , therefore , considered as arranged , and I went into the captain 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 59]: He was delirious , and constantly crying out about his honour and disgrace ; indeed , there is no doubt but that his anxiety to meet his antagonist was one very great cause of the fever having run so high ; but at times he changed the subject , and then he spoke of me and my mother .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 13]: `` Where is my boy -- my own boy , Percival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 11]: said he -- `` my pride -- where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 61]: Arabella , you must not be angry with me -- no , Arabella ; consider the consequence ; '' and then he would burst out in such fond expressions towards me , that the tears ran down my cheeks as I planted a kiss upon his forehead ; for he was insensible , and I could do so without offence .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 48]: Bob Cross , who had for some time been at his bedside , wiped the tears from his eyes , and said , `` Master Keene , how this man must have suffered to have cloaked his feelings towards you in the way which he has done .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 36]: However , I am glad to hear all this , and , if necessary , I will tell him of it -- ay , if I get seven dozen for it the next minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 26]: I remained with Bob Cross at his bedside for the whole day , during which he more than twenty times acknowledged me as his son .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 18]: As the evening closed in , I prepared in silence for the duty I had to perform .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 38]: To the surprise of Cross , who was ignorant of what I intended , I stripped off my own clothes and put on those of the captain , and then put his wig over my own hair .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 12]: I then examined myself in the glass , and was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 67]: `` Well , '' said Cross , looking at me , `` you do look like the captain himself , and might almost go on board and read the articles of war ; but , surely , Master Keene , '' added he , looking at the captain as he lay senseless in bed , `` this is no time for foolery of this sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 39]: `` It is no foolery , Bob , '' replied I , taking his hand ; `` I am going to represent the captain and fight a duel for him , or the service will be disgraced . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 29]: `` I did n't know that the captain had a duel to fight , '' replied Bob , `` although I heard that there had been words . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 8]: I then explained the whole to him .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 12]: `` You are right , Master Keene -- right in everything .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 11]: May God bless you , and send you good luck .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 9]: I wish I might go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 11]: `` No , Bob , that must not be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 14]: `` Then , God bless you , and may you floor the soldier .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 18]: Lord , what a state I shall be in till I know what has taken place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 21]: `` It will soon be known , Bob ; so good-bye , and I trust we shall meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 8]: I then went out of the bed-room .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 18]: The surgeon actually started when I made my appearance , and acknowledged that the personation was exact .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 40]: Taking the arm of the surgeon and the master , we set off , the master carrying the pistols , which had been prepared ; and in a quarter of an hour we arrived at the place of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 37]: My disguise was so complete that we had not hesitated to walk out sooner than we had intended ; and we found ourselves the first on the field of action , which I was glad of .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 23]: About dusk , which was the time agreed upon and about five minutes after our arrival , our antagonists made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 45]: There was no time to be lost , as there is little or no twilight in the West Indies ; so a polite bow was exchanged , and the ground marked out at eight paces by the master and the second of my opponent .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 71]: A very short parley then took place between Mr Smith and the other gentleman , who officiated for the adjutant , in which it was decided that we should turn back to back , with our pistols ready , and that on the words , `` Make ready -- present -- fire '' given in succession , we were to turn round to each other , level , and fire .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 44]: This made it more difficult to hit ; indeed it was almost impossible to take aim , as the words were given so quick after each other ; and the great point was , to fire as soon as the word was given .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 9]: The first discharge was not lucky for me .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 30]: I missed my antagonist , and received his bullet in my left shoulder ; this did not , however , disable me , and I said nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 50]: The pistols were again loaded and handed to us ; and on the signal being given , my adversary 's pistol went off a little before the word `` fire '' was given , and I felt myself again hit ; but I returned the fire with fatal success .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 11]: The ball went through his body , and he fell .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 30]: The surgeon , master , and his second , immediately went up , and raised him in a sitting position ; but in a few minutes he was senseless .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 17]: In the meantime I remained where I was , having dropped my pistol on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 59]: That I had an unpleasant pang at the idea of a fellow-creature having fallen by my hand in a duel , I acknowledge ; but when I called to mind why I had fought the duel , and that if had saved the honour of the captain -LRB- may I not say at once my father 's honour ?
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 19]: for that was my feeling -RRB- , I could not , and did not , repent the deed .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 21]: But I had not time given me to analyse my feelings ; a sensation of faintness rapidly crept over me .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 34]: The fact was that I had been bleeding profusely ; and while the surgeon and the others were still hanging over the expiring adjutant , I dropped and fell fainting on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 23]: When I recovered I found myself in bed , and attended on by the surgeon , the master , and Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 29]: `` Keep quiet , Keene , '' said the surgeon , `` and all will be well ; but keep quiet , that we may have no fever .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 16]: Here , drink this , and try if you can not go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 53]: They raised me up , and I swallowed the mixture ; my head was so confused , and I was so weak , that I felt as if I hardly dared breathe , lest my breath should leave my body , and I was glad to find myself again on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 42]: I was soon in a sound seep , from which I did not arouse for many hours , and , as I afterwards was told , had had a very narrow escape , from the exhaustion arising from the excessive haemorrhage .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 16]: When I opened my eyes the next morning , I could scarcely recall my senses .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 13]: I saw Bob Cross sometimes , and I heard moaning and talking .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 28]: I thought the latter was my own voice , but it was Captain Delmar , whose fever still continued , and who was in an alarming state .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 34]: It was not till the evening , twenty-four hours after the duel , that I could completely recall my senses ; then I did , and motioned to Cross that I wanted drink .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 29]: He gave me some lemonade -- it was nectar ; he then went out for the surgeon , who came to the bedside , and felt my pulse .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 35]: `` You 'll do now , my boy , '' said he ; `` get another good sleep to-night , and to-morrow morning you will have nothing to do but to get well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 7]: `` Where am I hit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 56]: said I. `` You had a ball in your shoulder and another in your hip , but they are both extracted ; the one in the hip cut through a large vein , and the haemorrhage was so great before you could be brought here , that at one time I thought you were gone .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 20]: Your life hung upon a thread for hours ; but we may thank God that all is right now .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 14]: You have no fever , and your pulse is getting strong again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 9]: `` How 's the captain , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 22]: `` As bad as bad can be just now ; but I have hopes of a change for the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 8]: `` And Captain W , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 4]: `` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 42]: he is dead ; and has so decidedly proved that his fever was not a sham , the soldiers are a little ashamed of themselves -- and so they ought to be ; but too often good feelings come too late .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 44]: Now , Keene , you have talked quite enough for to-night ; take your sedative mixture , and go to sleep again ; to-morrow , I have no doubt , you will be able to ask as many questions as you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 14]: `` Only one more , sir : -- is the adjutant dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 27]: `` I have not heard , '' replied the surgeon ; `` but we shall know to-morrow : now go to sleep , and good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 11]: When the surgeon left the room , `` Bob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 34]: said I. `` Not an answer will I give to-night , Mr Keene , '' said Bob Cross ; `` to-morrow morning we 'll have the rights and wrongs of the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: You must obey orders , sir , and go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 24]: As I knew Bob would do as he said , I laid my head down , and was soon once more in forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 5]: It was not daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 38]: When I again awoke , and found Cross snoring in the chair by the bedside ; poor fellow , he had never lain down since he came on shore , when the captain was first taken ill .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 39]: I felt much better , although my wounds tingled a little , and I was very anxious to know if Captain Delmar was out of danger ; but that could not be ascertained till I saw the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 10]: I remained thinking over the events which had passed .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 27]: I called to mind that the captain , in his delirium , had called me his own boy , his Percival and I felt more happy .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 15]: About an hour after I had awoke , the surgeon came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 9]: `` How is Captain Delmar , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 28]: said I. `` I am glad to say that he is much better ; but I must wake up poor Cross , who is tired out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 17]: Cross , who was awake the moment that we spoke , was now on his legs .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 17]: `` You must go to the captain , and keep the bed-clothes on him , Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 19]: He is now in a perspiration , and it must not be checked -- do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied Bob , walking away into the other room .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 33]: `` You are all right again , Keene , '' said the surgeon , feeling my pulse ; `` we will look at your wounds by-and-by , and change the dressing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 16]: `` Tell me , sir , '' said I , `` how have you managed ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 7]: Nobody has found it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 49]: `` Oh , no ; it is supposed that Captain Delmar is badly wounded , and that you have the yellow fever , and we must keep it up -- that is the reason why Bob Cross is the only one allowed to come into the sick rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 27]: I have no doubt that Captain Delmar will be sensible in a few hours , and then we shall be puzzled what to say to him .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 8]: Must we tell him the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 53]: `` Not at present , sir , at all events : tell him that he has fought the duel , and killed his man ; he will think that he did it when he was out of his senses , or else that the fever has driven it from his memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 50]: `` Well , perhaps that will be the best way just now ; it will relieve his mind , for with his return to sensibility will also revive his feelings of disgrace and dishonour ; and if they are not checked , the fever may come on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 37]: The surgeon gave me some breakfast this morning , and then dressed my wounds , which he pronounced were doing quite well ; and about twelve o'clock the master came on shore with the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 52]: The master came into my room after the first lieutenant went away , who had been told by the surgeon that he could not see Captain Delmar -- and he , of course , did not wish to come into contact with me , who he supposed had the yellow fever .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 28]: In the afternoon Captain Delmar woke up from his stupor -- the fever had left him , and he had nothing to combat with but extreme debility .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 6]: `` Where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 45]: said he , after a pause ; and , recollecting himself , he continued to Cross , who was the only person in the room , and who had received his instructions from the surgeon , `` How long have I lain here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 9]: `` Ever since the duel , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 10]: `` The duel -- how do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 18]: `` I mean ever since your honour fought the duel , and killed the soldger officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 15]: `` Killed -- duel -- I ca n't recollect having fought the duel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 57]: `` Dare say not , your honour , '' replied Bob ; `` you were in a roaring fever at the time ; but you would not stay in bed , all the surgeon could do -- go you would ; but when you had fought , we were obliged to carry you back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 25]: `` And so I really have fought -- I have not the least recollection -- I must have been in a high fever indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 6]: Where 's the surgeon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 24]: `` He 's in the verandah below , sir , speaking to some soldger officers who have come to inquire after your health .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 5]: Here he comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 25]: The surgeon came in , and Captain Delmar then said to him , `` Is this all true that Cross has been telling me ?
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 12]: Have I really fought a duel and killed my adversary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 43]: `` I regret to say , sir , that he is dead , and was buried yesterday ; but , if you please , you must not talk any more at present -- you must be quiet for a few hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 59]: `` Well , doctor , so that my honour is saved , I am content to obey you -- it 's very odd -- '' Here the captain was exhausted , and was silent , and in a few minutes he was again asleep , and remained slumbering till the next morning , when he was much better .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 50]: He then entered into conversation with the surgeon , making him describe the duel ; and the latter did so , so as to satisfy the captain ; and he also informed him that I had been taken ill with the fever , and was in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 5]: `` Next room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 13]: replied the captain : `` why was he not sent on board ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 19]: Are all the midshipmen who are taken ill to be brought to my house to be cured ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 16]: I overheard this reply of the captain , and it cut me to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 17]: I felt what an invincible pride had to be conquered before I could obtain my wishes .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 46]: The surgeon answered Captain Delmar , -- `` As only you and Mr Keene were taken with the fever , I thought it better that he should remain here , than that the ship 's company should take it by his being sent on board .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 12]: I trust , Captain Delmar , I have done right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 24]: `` Yes , I see , '' replied the captain ; `` you did perfectly right -- I did not think of that .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 9]: I hope Mr Keene is doing well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 18]: `` I trust that we shall get him through it , sir , '' replied the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 24]: `` Pray let him have anything that he requires , Mr -- ; let him want for nothing during his illness and convalescence .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 15]: He would be a heavy loss to the service , '' added the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 13]: `` He would , indeed , sir , '' replied the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 24]: `` Here are the journals of St. Pierre , in which there are several accounts of the duel , most of them incorrect .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 12]: Some say that you were twice wounded , others once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 24]: `` I dare say they thought so , '' replied the captain , `` for Cross tells me that I was carried home .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 14]: It 's very singular that I should have fought in such a condition .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 26]: Thank you , Mr -- ; I will read them when I have lain down a little , for I am tired again already . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: The surgeon then informed the captain of the death of Captain W. `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 4]: replied Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 15]: `` Well , I will not make any appointments until I am better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 14]: The captain then lay down again , leaving the newspapers on the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 39]: A week now passed , during which both the captain and I became nearly convalescent : we had both been out of bed , and had remained for a few hours on the sofas in our respective rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 30]: The surgeon told me that it would be necessary to tell him the truth very soon , and that he thought he would do so on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 18]: It did , however , happen that the discovery was not made to him by the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 31]: In the afternoon , when the latter was on board , Captain Delmar felt so strong that he resolved to put on his clothes , and go into the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 30]: He desired Cross to give them to him , and the first articles handed to him were his trowsers , and Bob quite forgot that I had worn them .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: `` Why , how 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 19]: said the captain -- `` here 's a hole through the waistband , and they are bloody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 24]: Bob was so frightened , that he walked out of the room as if he had not heard what the captain had said .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 25]: It appears that the captain took up his coat , and discovered another hole in the shoulder , with the same marks of blood .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 33]: `` This is quite a dream , '' said the captain , talking to himself -- `` I 've no wound , and yet the newspapers say that I was wounded twice .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 2]: Cross !
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 2]: Cross !
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 6]: -- Where is Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 48]: Bob , who had taken refuge in my room , where we overheard everything he said , whispered , `` It 's no use now , Mr Keene , -- I must tell it all ; never fear me , I know how to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 19]: And then he obeyed the captain 's summons , leaving me in a state of great nervous anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 25]: `` Cross , '' said the captain sternly , `` I insist upon knowing the truth : I have been deceived by my officers .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 13]: Did I , or did I not , fight this duel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 36]: `` Well , sir , '' replied Cross , `` the truth was only kept back from you till you were quite well again , and I suppose I must tell it to you now .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 31]: You were too ill , and you raved about our honour , and that you were disgraced , and that -- '' `` Well , go on , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 18]: `` I will , Captain Delmar ; but I hope you 'll not be angry , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 97]: Mr Keene could not bear to see you in that way , and he said he would lay down his life for you at any time , and he begged Mr Smith , the master , to allow him to fight the duel , because he said that he was so like you in person -LRB- which , somehow or other he is , that 's certain -RRB- , that no one would know it was him if he put on your honour 's wig and uniform : that 's how it was , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 75]: `` Well , sir , the master could not bear the sneering of the sogers on shore , and he consented that Mr Keene should take your place , which he did , sir ; and I hope you will not be angry with Mr Keene , for it 's your old coat , sir , and I think it may have a piece let in , that it wo n't be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 62]: Cross then went on describing the whole affair -- of course praising me -- and told the captain that everybody on board , as well as on shore , thought that he was wounded and that I had been taken with the yellow fever , and that nobody knew the real truth except the master , the surgeon , and himself .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 8]: `` Is Mr Keene seriously hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 8]: inquired the captain , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 14]: `` No , sir ; the doctor says he will do very well .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 32]: He was as near gone as ever a man was : at one time his breath would not move a feather -- all the blood was out of his body . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 29]: For a minute the captain made no reply ; at last he said , in a quiet tone , `` You may leave the room , Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 48]: What were the thoughts and feelings of Captain Delmar when he was left to reflect upon the information which he had received , I can not tell but that he was not angry I inferred by the tone in which he desired Cross to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 21]: I was absorbed in my own feelings , when the surgeon entered the room , and gave me a letter .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 45]: `` Here 's a schooner just come in with despatches from the admiral , '' said the surgeon : `` the second lieutenant has brought them on shore for the captain , and among the letters from England I found this one for you .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 20]: I have seen Cross , '' continued the surgeon , nodding his head significantly as he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 30]: `` The second lieutenant , with despatches , sir , '' reported Bob Cross to the captain in the other room -- `` Shall I show him in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 22]: `` No , I am not well ; desire him to send them in by you , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 35]: While the captain was busy with his despatches , I read my letter , which was from my mother , enclosing a copy of one from my grandmother , announcing my mother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 18]: Of course there were a great many dying wishes ; but that was a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 36]: I felt happy that this letter to the captain arrived at such a propitious time , as I knew that the announcement of my mother 's death would be a great point in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 63]: That it ought not to have been , I confess ; but I knew whom I had to deal with : the captain was ashamed of his intimacy , and the claims of my mother upon him , but not so much ashamed of me ; and , now that she was removed , probably he might not be at all ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 25]: My mother was no relation , and below him -- I was his own flesh and blood , and half ennobled by so being .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 11]: The captain sent on board orders for getting under weigh .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 69]: It appeared that the admiral had written to him , desiring him to sail for the coast of South America , to look after a French frigate , and that , as there was no farther occasion for so large a force at Martinique , he was to leave the next senior officer in command ; but this was Captain W , who had died of the fever .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 57]: As senior in command , Captain Delmar then filled up the vacancy ; the captain of a corvette was appointed to Captain W 's ship ; our first lieutenant to the command of the corvette ; but the lieutenant 's vacancy was not filled up , much to the surprise of the officers of the squadron .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 83]: This was the work of the afternoon ; in the evening the master was sent for , and a consultation held with him and the surgeon , which ended in the captain 's consenting to go on board with his arm in a sling , as if he had been wounded , and my being put into a cot , and removed on board to the captain 's cabin , as if still too weak with the fever to quit my bed .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 20]: Cross was enjoined silence , and I was made acquainted by the surgeon with the result of the conference .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 22]: The next morning we were all embarked , and we hove the anchor up , and made sail to the southward .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 25]: It must be observed , that I had neither seen nor had any communications with the captain , during the whole of this time .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 33]: He was informed by the surgeon that I was in great distress of mind at the news of my mother 's death , and that my recovery would be retarded in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 22]: IT was not until three or four days after the ship had sailed from Martinique that the captain spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 35]: I had during that time remained in my cot , which was hung up in the fore-cabin , and when the surgeon dressed my wounds it was only in the presence of Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 45]: On the fourth morning after our sailing , the captain came inside of the screen , which was hung round my cot : -- `` Well , Mr Keene , '' said he in a very kind voice , `` how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 31]: `` Much better , sir , I thank you ; and hope you will look over the great liberty I ventured to take for the honour of the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 45]: `` Why , '' replied the captain , smiling , `` I think you have been sufficiently punished already for your temerity ; I appreciate your motive of action and feel obliged to you for your great zeal towards the service and towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 53]: The only objection -LRB- I may say annoyance -RRB- I have on the subject is , the mystery and secrecy compelled to be observed in consequence of your taking my place ; and still more , that one of the seamen of the ship should be a party to the secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 39]: `` I certainly did not consider the consequences as I ought to have done , sir , when I ventured to act as I did , '' replied I. `` Say no more about it , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 23]: I am very sorry to hear of your mother 's death ; but it was not , I believe , unexpected . ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 21]: `` No , sir , '' replied I ; `` and therefore the shock has not been so great . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 52]: `` Well , Mr Keene , of course it is from the interest I took in your mother that I was induced to take you under my protection , and her death will make no difference in that point , so long as you conduct yourself as you have hitherto done .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 23]: You have now created a strong interest for yourself by your good conduct , and I shall not lose sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 15]: How many months have you yet to serve before your time is out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 18]: `` I have served five years and seven months , as far as I can recollect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 5]: `` So I thought .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 42]: Now , Mr Keene , it was because I thought of you that I did not fill up the lieutenant 's vacancy which was made by the death of Captain W and the promotion of the commander and my first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 93]: As soon as you are well , I will give you an acting order as lieutenant of this ship ; and , as we are now on a sort of roving commission , I have no doubt but that you will have served your time , and found the means of passing , before we join the admiral ; your promotion will , under such circumstances , be , I have no doubt , confirmed ; so all you have to do now is to get well as fast as you can .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 24]: The captain gave me a most gracious nod , and then went outside of the screen , giving me no time for thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 38]: I was , indeed , overjoyed ; not so much at the promotion as at the change in the captain 's manner towards me : a change so palpable that it filled me with the fondest anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 12]: I remained for a long while reflecting upon my future prospects .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 40]: As a lieutenant of the same ship I should be more in contact with him : he could now converse and take notice of me without its being considered remarkable ; nay , he could be intimate with me .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 63]: I resolved to be most careful of my conduct , so as not to alarm his pride by the least familiarity , and hoped , eventually , to play my cards so as to obtain my earnest wish ; but I felt that there was a great deal of ground to go over first , and that the greatest circumspection was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 48]: I felt that I had still to raise myself in his opinion and in the opinion of the world to a much higher position than I was in at present , before I could expect that Captain Delmar would , virtually , acknowledge me as his son .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 84]: I felt that I had to wade through blood , and stand the chance of thousands of balls and bullets in my professional career , before I could do all this ; a bright vista of futurity floated before me and , in the far distance , I felt myself in the possession of my ambition , and with my eyes still fixed upon it I dropped fast asleep , revelling still in the same dreams which I had indulged in when awake .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 20]: In a fortnight I was quite recovered ; my wounds had healed up , and I now walked about .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 154]: Having had my uniform altered by the ship 's tailor , and procured an epaulet from one of the lieutenants , I took possession of my cabin in the gun-room , and was warmly received by my new messmates ; but I did not return to my duty for nearly a month , on account of a little lameness still remaining , and which the surgeon declared was often the case after the yellow fever !! I ought to have observed , that when my mother was so indulgent as to commit suicide for my sake , she had taken every precaution , and the letter of my grandmother informed Captain Delmar that my mother had bequeathed me 12,000 pounds in the three per cents , which she had laid by from her business , and that therefore there was no longer any occasion that I should be an expense to Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 65]: It must not , however , be supposed , from my grandmother stating this , that Captain Delmar was at all mercenary or stingy ; on the contrary , considering that , as the second son of a nobleman , he had only 1,000 pounds per annum besides his pay , he was exceedingly liberal -LRB- although not extravagant -RRB- in all money matters .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 45]: At last I was well enough to return to my duty ; and glad I was to be once more walking the quarter-deck , not as before , on the lee , but on the weather side , with an epaulet on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 64]: Strange to say , there was not a midshipman in the ship -LRB- although there were so many -RRB- who had served so long as I had , and in consequence there was not any heart-burning or jealousy at my promotion , and I continued on the best terms with my old mess-mates , although gradually lessening the intimacy which existed between us .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 37]: But that was not intentional on my part ; it was the effect of my promotion , and removal from the berth of a set of lads to the company of the senior and older officers .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 16]: I was now a man , and had the feelings and thoughts of a man .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 22]: My frolics and tricks were discarded with the midshipman 's coat ; and in respecting my new rank I respected myself .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 62]: Now that I walked on the same side of the deck , Captain Delmar very often entered into conversation with me ; and although at first it was with caution on his part , yet , when he found that I never presumed , and was , invariably , most respectful , he became on much more intimate terms with me .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 51]: During three months we continued cruising about without falling in with or having received any intelligence of the French frigate which we were sent in quest of ; at last Captain Delmar resolved to change the cruising ground , and we ran up to ten degrees of latitude further north .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 56]: As we were running up , we fell in with an American brig , and brought her to ; a boat was sent for the captain , who , when he came on board , was interrogated by Captain Delmar , as to his having seen or heard of any French vessel on that coast .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 22]: As the conversation took place on the quarter-deck , and I was officer of the watch , I can repeat it .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 23]: `` Well , '' replied the American through his nose , `` I reckon there is a Frenchman in these parts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 9]: `` Have you fallen in with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 4]: inquired Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 27]: `` Well , I may say I have ; for I lay alongside of her in Cartagena when I was taking in my cargo of hides .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 24]: You have n't such a thing as a spar as will make me a pole top-gallant mast , captain , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 8]: `` Is she large or small ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 35]: `` Well , captain , I do n't care whether the spar be large or small ; I 've two carpenters on board , and I 'll soon dub it down into shape . ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 22]: `` I inquired about the vessel -- I did not refer to the spar , '' replied Captain Delmar , haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 32]: `` And I referred to the spar , which is my business , and not to the vessel , which is no consarn of mine , '' replied the American captain .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 31]: `` You see , master , we have both our wants ; you want information , I want a spar : I have no objection to a fair swop . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 24]: `` Well , '' replied Captain Delmar , rather amused , `` give me the information and you shall have the spar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 6]: `` That 's agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 28]: `` Send for the carpenter , and desire him to get out a small spar , Mr -- , '' said Captain Delmar to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 18]: `` Well , captain , that looks like business , and so now I 'll go on .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 39]: The Frenchman is as large as you ; may be , '' said he , looking round the deck , `` he may be a bit larger , but you wo n't mind that , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 12]: `` Did you leave her in port when you sailed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 12]: `` I reckon she was off two days before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 12]: `` And how many days is it since you sailed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 9]: `` Just four days , I calculate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 12]: `` And did you hear where she was going to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 24]: `` Yes , I did , and I 've a notion I could put my finger upon her now , if I choosed .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 33]: Captain , you have n't got a coil of two-inch which you could lend me -- I ai n't got a topsail brace to reeve and mine are very queer just now .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 21]: I reckon they 've been turned end for end so often , that there 's an end of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 16]: `` You say that you know where the vessel is -- where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 16]: `` Captain , that 's telling -- ca n't I have the two inch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 22]: `` We have not a whole coil of two-inch left , sir , '' said the master , touching his hat .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 14]: `` We might spare him enough for a pair of new braces . ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 26]: `` Well , well , I 'm reasonable altogether , and if so be you have n't got it , I do n't expect it .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 33]: It 's very odd now , but I ca n't just now remember the place that the French vessel was going to ; it 's slipped clean out of my memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 14]: `` Perhaps the two-inch might help your memory , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 17]: `` Mr Smith , let the rope be got up and put into the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 22]: `` Well , '' said the American captain , `` as you say , mister , it may help my memory .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 41]: It 's not the first time that I 've freshened a man 's memory with a bit of two-inch myself , '' continued he , grinning at his own joke ; `` but I do n't see it coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 33]: `` I have ordered it to be put in the boat , '' replied Captain Delmar , haughtily : `` my orders are not disobeyed , nor is my word doubted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 67]: `` Not by them as knows you , I dare say , captain , but you 're a stranger to me ; I do n't think I ask much , after all -- a bit of spar and a bit of rope -- just to tell you where you may go and take a fine vessel , and pocket a nation lot of dollars as prize-money .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 14]: Well , there 's the rope , and now I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 32]: She was going off Berbice or Surinam , to look after the West Indiamen , who were on the coast , or expected on it , I do n't know which .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 37]: There you 'll find her , as sure as I stand here ; but I think that she is a bit bigger than this vessel -- you do n't mind that , I dare say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 15]: `` You may go on board now , sir , '' said Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 15]: `` Well , thank ye , captain , and good luck to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 31]: The American captain went down the side ; and as soon as our boat returned , and was hoisted up , we made all sail for the coast of Demerara .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 38]: `` She must be a fine vessel , '' said Captain Delmar to me , as he was walking the deck , -- `` a very fine vessel , if she is bigger than we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 53]: `` You will excuse me , Captain Delmar , if I venture to observe that there was an expression in the eye of the American , when he said a bit bigger , which made me take it into my head , that in saying so , he was only deceiving us .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 18]: The Americans are not very partial to us , and would be glad of any revenge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 37]: `` That may be , Mr Keene ; but I do not see that he can be deceiving us , by making her out to be larger , as it is putting us on our guard .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 17]: Had he said that she was smaller , it would then have been deceiving us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 79]: `` I did not take it in that sense , sir , '' replied I. `` He said a bit bigger ; now , I ca n't help thinking that a bit bigger was meant to deceive us , and that it will prove that the Frenchman is a line-of-battle ship , and not a frigate : he wished to leave us under the impression that it was a larger frigate than our own and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 31]: `` It may be so , '' replied Captain Delmar , thoughtfully ; `` at all events , Mr Keene , I am obliged to you for the suggestion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 19]: The captain took two or three more turns fore and aft in silence and then quitted the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 31]: In three days we had gained the latitude of Berbice , and on the fourth morning the men at the mast-head were keeping a sharp look-out for any strange sail .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 47]: Our head was then towards the land , which , being very low , could not be seen ; the breeze was light , the royals had been set , and the men piped down to breakfast , when the mast-head-man reported three sail right ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 53]: We soon made them out to be merchant vessels , and as they separated , and made all sail from us , we made sure that they had been captured ; and so it proved when we took possession of them , which we did not do of the third before night-fall .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 49]: Upon interrogating the prisoners and the few English who had been left on board the prizes , we found out that I had been right in my conjecture ; they had been captured by a French line-of-battle ship , which they had left in shore the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 30]: The English reported her a very fast sailer , and believed her to be an eighty gun ship -- indeed the French prisoners acknowledged that such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 29]: This was very important intelligence , and Captain Delmar walked up and down deck in deep thought : the fact was , he was puzzled how to act .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 47]: To attempt to cope with such a force , unless under peculiarly favourable circumstances , would be madness : to leave the coast and our mercantile navy exposed to her depredations , was at the same time very repulsive to his feelings and sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 25]: The prizes had been manned , the prisoners were on board , the boats hoisted up , and the Manilla still remained hove to .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 28]: The fact was , the captain did not know which way to put the ship 's head ; and he walked up and down in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 10]: `` Mr Keene , is it your watch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 23]: `` Oblige me by telling the master to work up the reckoning ; I wish to know exactly where we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 28]: `` It is done already , sir , '' replied I , `` and pricked off on the chart -- I have just left the gun-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 14]: `` Then , Mr Keene , bring the chart into my cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 26]: I followed into the cabin with the chart , which I laid down on the table , and pointed out the position of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 42]: `` You were right in your supposition , Mr Keene , '' said the captain ; `` and really this vessel turning out to be a line-of-battle ship has put me in a very awkward predicament -- I really am puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 22]: Fighting is of no use , and yet run away I will not , if I can possibly help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 34]: Now , I had been studying the chart , and had made up my own mind how I should have acted under the circumstances , had I been in Captain Delmar 's position .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 54]: The great point was , to give him my ideas without appearing to offer advice ; I therefore replied , `` We have one advantage , at all events sir ; we have been cruising so long that we are flying light -- I do n't think we draw sixteen feet water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 22]: `` Yes , that may give us the heels of her in light winds , certainly , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 43]: `` I think she can not draw less than twenty-six or twenty-seven feet of water , sir , '' continued I , to put him on the right scent , `` which , on this coast , will be a great advantage .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 47]: I think , sir , when I was down below , I measured from soundings to soundings , and the water is so shallow , and deepens so gradually , that there is a distance of four miles between seventeen feet and twenty-eight feet water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 32]: I took up the compass so as to take in the two soundings laid down in the chart , and then measuring the distance , showed that my assertion was true .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 9]: The captain said nothing for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 10]: At last I perceived a smile on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 16]: `` Tell the officer of the watch to lower down the cutter , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 50]: Go on board of the prizes , and tell them , in addition to their present orders , to follow us , that in case of an enemy , they are to run as close in shore as the water will allow them , and drop their anchors . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 15]: `` Aye , aye , sir , '' replied I , leaving the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 78]: This order satisfied me that the captain perceived what I would suggest , which was , that if we once got in shore and in shallow water we might laugh at the line-of-battle ship , which , in all probability would not be able to get near enough to reach us with her guns ; or , if she attempted it , she would run on shore , and then we should have the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 30]: As soon as I had given the orders to the prize-masters and returned on board , the boat was hoisted up , and all sail made for the land .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 26]: At twelve o'clock we sounded , and found ourselves in nine-fathom water , by which we calculated we were about thirty miles from the land .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 24]: I hardly need say that a most careful lookout was kept up , that we might not fall in with our formidable adversary .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 82]: At one o'clock the moon rose , and I , having the middle watch , surveyed the horizon on every side , but without discovering the enemy ; but at half-past three the day dawned , and before my watch was over it was broad daylight ; and then , just as I was going down , having been relieved by the second lieutenant , a strange sail was reported about eight miles to leeward , two points before the beam .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 54]: The second lieutenant hastened down to the cabin , to report to the captain , and I went up to the mast-head to make her out , and I soon discovered that she was a line-of-battle ship : I immediately descended , and reported to the captain , who had come on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 67]: As we could distinguish the masts and sails of the enemy very well from the deck , the glasses were fixed upon her at the gang-way , and she was seen to set her royals and flying jib in chase of us ; but we felt that we were safe , as we should be in shallow water long before she could beat up to us .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 35]: All we had to fear for was the merchant vessels which we had re-taken , and which were two or three miles astern of us , with all the sail that they could carry .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 46]: It was a five-knot breeze , and the water quite smooth , which was very favourable for the line-of-battle ship and ourselves , but not for the merchant vessels , which , with their cargoes , required more wind to propel them through the water .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 91]: The state of affairs , when the hands were piped to breakfast , was as follows : -- The French line-of-battle ship had stood in for the land , under all sail , until half-past-seven , being then , as she was when we first saw her , exactly two points before the beam , when , probably being in shoal water , she had tacked , and was now a little abaft our beam , and lying pretty well up for the merchant vessel the furthest astern of us .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 24]: Since she had tacked , she had risen her hull out of water , so as to show her upper tier of guns .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 93]: Two of the merchant vessels were about three miles astern of us , -- the other one , five , and stood a fair chance of being cut off ; the more so , because when we discovered the enemy , we were standing about two points free , right for the coast ; whereas , upon her hauling her wind in chase , we of course did the same , which made us approach the shallow water in a more slanting direction , and consequently not get in quite so soon .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 37]: We were now in seven fathoms water , and , by our pricking off on the chart , about eleven miles from land , which was so low as to be barely visible from the mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 17]: The men were allowed an hour to their breakfast , and then we beat to quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 40]: The captain did not , however , put out the fires , so as to prevent the ship 's company 's dinner being cooked , as everything was ready , and the magazines could be opened in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 42]: At ten o'clock we had drawn into six fathoms water ; the Frenchman was now nearly astern of us , still on the opposite tack , and passing about three miles to leeward of the merchant vessel which lagged most behind .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 56]: It was now considered certain that she would re-capture this vessel , which was at least seven miles astern of us , and not impossible that she might take one , if not both of the others , as it was evident she was a prime sailer , as fast almost as our own ship .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 30]: At a quarter-past ten , the French line-of-battle ship tacked , and stood right after us in our wake , being now hull down about twelve miles from us .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 19]: `` He 'll soon have the starnmost vessel , Mr Keene , '' said Bob Cross to me .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 18]: `` Mr Dott has charge of her ; he is always in some scrape or other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` but he gets out of them , and I dare say he will out of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: `` Helm up there , quarter-master -- flatten in forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 21]: `` The wind 's heading us , sir , '' said the master ; `` she 's full again now .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 9]: Thus , boy , and nothing off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: `` She has broken off two points , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 20]: `` All the better , '' replied the captain ; `` it 's a squeak for Mr Dott . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 26]: In a few minutes we perceived that the other vessel had met the change in the wind and had broken off as well as ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 25]: The Frenchman did not now lay up for the merchant vessel as she did before , and the latter had some chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 66]: It was very exciting : for as the time drew nearer to noon , the wind became more light and more variable , and at one time all the vessels broke off another point ; shortly afterwards , the wind flew back again to the point which it at first blew from , and the enemy lay once more right up for the merchant vessels .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 18]: The French line-of-battle ship was still about four miles astern of the merchant vessel nearest to her .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 15]: `` I think we shall have a calm soon , '' observed Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 43]: `` Square the mainyard ; we may as well be nearer to her , as not , now ; for if it falls calm she will recapture them with her boats , and we shall be too far to give any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 13]: Get the yard tackles up : all ready , Mr -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 13]: `` Aye , aye , sir , '' replied the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 21]: `` Pipe the boat 's crew away , and let them get their guns and ammunition on the gangway . ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 34]: It was about a quarter to eleven when we hove to , the breeze still continuing variable and light , and the French line-of-battle ship did not come up so fast as before .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 20]: We sounded after we hove to , and found that we were in five and a half fathoms water .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 78]: At twelve o'clock , in consequence of our having hove to , the relative positions of the vessels were as follows : -- The two merchant vessels which had been about four miles astern of us were now alongside of us ; the third was about three miles astern of us ; and the Frenchman was about the same distance astern of her ; so that our frigate was about six miles from the French line-of-battle ship .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 37]: Captain Delmar had given orders to pipe to dinner at seven bells -LRB- half-past eleven o'clock -RRB- ; that in case the boats were required , the men might have dined before the were sent away .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 67]: A few minutes after twelve o'clock it fell a dead calm ; the hands were turned up , the boats hoisted out and lowered down , the guns and ammunition put in them , and everything in readiness ; we keeping our glasses upon the enemy , and watching her manoeuvring , which , at the distance we were , was now easily to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 77]: Captain Delmar was aware that he ran some risk in sending his boats away , for it might so happen that a breeze might spring up from the seaward , and the enemy have the advantage of it long before us ; if so , it might bring her up to the vessel astern , and the boats be captured : indeed it might bring her up nearly alongside of us before we caught the wind .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 38]: It was necessary therefore , to be very cautious , and not send the boats away till the last moment -- that is , before we saw the French ship hoisting out or lowering down her own .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 27]: That the Frenchman knew that our boats had been hoisted out , could not be doubted , as their eyes were quite as sharp as ours .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 65]: They , however , tried to double us ; for all of a sudden , as I had my glass upon the French ship , I perceived three boats coming round her quarter , and pulling right for the merchant vessel : the fact was , that she had lowered down her stern and quarter boats to leeward , which we could not perceive .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 19]: I reported this immediately to the captain , who ordered the boats ' crews to be piped away .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 11]: `` Who is to command the boats , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 5]: said the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 9]: `` Mr Keene , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 15]: `` Mr Keene , I wish to speak with you before you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 34]: Captain Delmar then walked to the capstern , and , in few words , pointed out what I have just stated as the difficulty which might occur , and the chances of capture .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 9]: `` You understand me , Mr Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 30]: `` Perfectly , sir , '' replied I. `` Well , then , I trust to your discretion , Mr Keene , and hope I shall not be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 6]: Now you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 17]: `` The French ship is getting up her yard tackles , '' said the signal man .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 12]: `` Then you have no time to lose , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 13]: As for the small boats , they are of no consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 10]: I went down the side , and shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 23]: Our men gave way cheerfully and manfully ; and the three boats of the Frenchmen had but a little start of us .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 28]: In half an hour we were both within less than a mile of the merchant vessel ; but the French boats were the nearest of the two .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 7]: The affair now became very exciting .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 35]: In another ten minutes the French boats had gained the merchant vessel , and the men were clambering up her sides , while we were not more than three cables ' length from them .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 49]: That Tommy Dott was defending himself was to be presumed , as a good deal of firing took place ; but before we could get alongside , it was evident that he and his men had been mastered , and the French were in possession of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 6]: But now our turn came .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 47]: Dividing my boats , six in number , into two divisions , we boarded on both sides , and very soon had regained the vessel and mastered the French , who did not amount to more than thirty-five men , while we had more than seventy .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 43]: We found that the Frenchmen had not spared our people on board of the vessel , all of them being wounded or killed ; but the fact was that Tommy Dott had fought most nobly , and resisted to the very last .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 6]: He himself -- poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 22]: -- lay against the cap-stern , with his head cut open by a blow of a cutlass , and quite insensible .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 46]: As soon as we had secured the prisoners , I turned my eyes to the line-of-battle ship , and saw that her large boats had shoved off ; they were five in number , but much larger , and holding more men than we had .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 50]: A little reflection decided me that we should have a better chance of resisting them on board of the vessel than in the boats ; and I determined that I would get my boats ' guns up on board of the vessel , and arm her in that way .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 83]: It was necessary , however , to secure our boats , that they might not cut them away from alongside ; I therefore , as soon as the guns and ammunition were on board , lowered the iron chain cable down from the bows , and passed it from one boat to the other under the fixed thwarts of each boat , including those captured from the French , hauling the end of the cable on board again through the stern port .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 23]: We had plenty of time to do this , and make any other preparation on board , before the French boats arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 51]: It was a dead calm ; the sea was like a mirror , and the advancing boats , as their oars rose and fell in the water , gave you the idea of creatures possessed of life and volition , as they rapidly forced their way through the yielding fluid .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 23]: The vessel 's stern was towards the line-of-battle ship , and the boats were pulling up a little on the starboard quarter .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 36]: The guns which I had hoisted on board had , for want of any other means , been sufficiently secured by ropes to the slides and breechings to enable us to fire them with effect .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 67]: When the boats were about a quarter of a mile from us , we opened our fire ; not that we expected much from our guns , as we knew we could not obtain more than two good shots at the boats before they were alongside ; still there was a chance of hitting and disabling them , and no chance was to be thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 18]: Our first shot was successful ; it struck one of the pinnaces , and she swamped immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 25]: Our men cheered , while the other French boats pulled to it , and took up the men who were floating in the water .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 44]: Before they could effect this , another gun was fired with grape and round , which apparently did some execution , as there appeared to be much confusion on board of the two boats that had gone to the assistance of their comrades .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 76]: We now fully expected the boats to advance ; on the contrary , they spread out on each quarter , and opened their fire upon us with their guns -- a very foolish act on their part , as it gave us every advantage ; for they were far superior to us in number of men , and should have boarded us at once , instead of risking the loss of more of their boats .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 72]: So little did we expect this , that at one time I was debating whether I should not leave the guns in the boats alongside , instead of getting them on board , that there might be no delay in case wind sprang up , and it were necessary that we should be off ; of course , as it was , I was very glad that I had decided otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 42]: The action , if it may be so termed , now continued for about half an hour without any great casualty on either side : we had five or six men wounded on board of the vessel , but none killed .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 69]: I had occasionally looked round to see if there was any appearance of wind , and just about this time I perceived a black line in the offing , which promised not only wind , but wind from the very quarter which would be most disastrous to us , and I began to feel very anxious , when I heard a bugle sounded from the largest French boat .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 22]: This was the signal to advance , and I was very glad , as the affair would now be soon decided .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 53]: As all our boats were secured on the starboard side of the vessel , the Frenchmen did not attempt to board on that side , as in so doing it would have been at a double disadvantage ; they had therefore no alternative but to board all together on the larboard side .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 64]: Two of the boats ' guns had been fixed on that side -- double shotted and depressed , so as to be fired at the moment one of the boats should pass beneath them ; they were both fired at the leading boat , the launch , which was very large and full of men , and the shot went through her bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 29]: This did not prevent her coming alongside : but she filled and sank almost immediately afterwards , while the men were climbing up the sides of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 56]: The sinking of this boat prevented the men of the other boats outside of her from supporting their companions , and we had therefore only to meet the force of the launch and the two other boats which had come alongside ahead of her , and which was in number not equal to our own .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 38]: We always had an idea that the French would never do much in the way of boarding , and so it proved ; they were beat down as fast as they made their appearance above the bulwarks .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 27]: The French lieutenant was attempting to get over the gunwale ; he was unsupported , as almost all his men had tumbled back into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 35]: Instead of cutting him down , I caught him by the collar , and hauled him on board , and as soon as he was disarmed , gave him in charge of a marine .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 28]: In ten minutes all was over : two of the French boats remained alongside , and the others shoved off , half manned , and dropped astern .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 53]: We gave them three cheers as a parting salutation , but we had no time to lose -- the wind was evidently springing up fast ; already cat 's paws were to be seen here and there rippling the water , and the line on the horizon was now dark and broad .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 29]: I ordered our boats to be ready for starting , the guns to be got in , and the wounded men divided among them as fast as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 32]: The two large French boats which remained on the starboard side we cleared of the men who lay in them , and then had their bottoms beat out to sink them .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 82]: The French lieutenant and two other officers I ordered into our own boats , to take on board as prisoners ; the rest of the French who had been captured , with their wounded , we put into the three small French boats which had been captured in the first attack , taking away their oars , that , when I shoved off and left the vessel , they might drift about till they were picked up by the French ship .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 20]: Every thing being in readiness , I had now to decide what I should do with the merchant vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 28]: The wind coming up so fast from the seaward , gave her no chance of escape , and I decided that I would set her on fire .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 50]: Having so done in three different parts , to ensure her destruction , I then shoved off with our boats , having first pushed off the Frenchmen in their boats without oars , and wished them good-bye ; they certainly did look very foolish , and anything but pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 83]: As we pulled for the frigate , I perceived that the line-of-battle ship 's sails were filling , and that it was touch and go with us ; but I also knew that she could not leave her boats and that it would take some time to pick them up ; two were half-manned , and pulling towards her ; the other three were without oars , and must be picked by the other boats ; all of which would occasion delay .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 32]: Notwithstanding , we pulled as hard as we could and were halfway back before the breeze was sufficiently steady to enable the line-of-battle ship to make much progress through the water .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 57]: Of course we could not well see what was going on when we had pulled away in the boats , and were at a distance ; all we could see was , that the French line-of-battle ship was not yet in chase , from which we presumed that she had not yet picked up her boats .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 23]: In the meantime the merchant vessel burnt furiously , and the columns of smoke very often hid the enemy from our view .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 33]: Before we arrived on board the breeze had passed us and caught the sails of our frigate and the two merchant vessels , so that we were more easy on that score .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 50]: Captain Delmar had been very anxious ; the yards , tackles , and stays , and the tackles for hoisting up the quarter-boats , were already hanging down as we pulled alongside , and `` all hands in boats '' was piped before we could get up the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 30]: There was no time to be lost : the French line-of-battle ship had picked up her boats , and was now in chase , with studding-sails below and abaft .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 17]: The two merchant vessels had made all sail , and were running inshore ahead of us .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 27]: I touched my hat to the captain , and said , `` Come on board , sir -- shall I see the quarter-boats hoisted up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 12]: `` If you please , Mr Keene , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 34]: The fact was , it was very easy to tell my story after the boats were up and sail made upon the frigate , and I knew there was no time for talking .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 30]: I never witnessed such a rapidity as was shown on this occasion ; in less than five minutes all the boats were on board , and all sail made .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 24]: I looked at the French line-of-battle ship ; she was within four miles of us , and bringing up a very steady breeze .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 27]: But we were now drawing through the water , and as the re-captured vessels were three miles ahead of us , there was nothing to fear .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 24]: Captain Delmar came aft to look at the Frenchman , who had already passed by the vessel which I had set on fire .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 21]: `` Now , then , Mr Keene , '' said he , `` we will know what has taken place .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 10]: Of course we have seen most of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 8]: I narrated what the reader already knows .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 12]: `` What do you suppose to have been the loss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 14]: `` I should say three boats , and about forty men , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 27]: I forgot , sir , to tell you that we have a lieutenant and two officers prisoners , whom I brought on board with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 14]: `` Desire them to be brought on deck , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 19]: `` Mr Keene , you have done your work well -- with great gallantry and great judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: I touched my hat , not a little pleased at such a compliment from .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 3]: Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 11]: `` What 's the last soundings , Mr Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 4]: inquired the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 13]: `` And a quarter four , sir , '' said the master .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 13]: `` This chase wo n't last long , '' observed the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 8]: `` Take in the lower studding-sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 37]: The French lieutenant was then questioned ; but with the exception of the name of the ship and captain , there was little to be expected from him , and he was dismissed and sent below .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 23]: This affair , however , was not without loss on our side -LRB- principally arising from Tommy Dott 's stout defence -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 20]: We had two men killed , and we had altogether fourteen men wounded -- some of them very severely .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 50]: My friend Tommy Dott came on board a miserable object , his face and hair matted with blood ; but when it was washed away , he proved to be not so much hurt as was supposed : the cut was severe , but the bones were not injured .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 67]: He was very soon out of his hammock again , and his chief pleasure was to put his tongue in his cheek and make faces at the French lieutenant , who at last became so annoyed , that he complained to Captain Delmar , who ordered Mr Tommy to leave off these expressions of national animosity , if he had any wish to obtain his promotion .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 4]: But to return .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 35]: As the breeze freshened , and the French ship had the first of it ; she rapidly gained upon us , and in an hour and a half was about three miles from us .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 47]: We had now shoaled our water to three fathoms and a half , which was quite near enough to the ground , as it left but four feet between our keel and the bottom ; the studding-sails were taken in , and we ranged the cable .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 55]: A few minutes afterwards the French line-of-battle ship was seen to shorten sail , and haul to the wind ; she had followed us into as shoal water as far as she dared to venture in , and as she rounded to , out of spite , I presume , she fired a gun .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 34]: The evening was now closing in , and as there was every appearance of fine weather , we stood out till we were again in four fathoms , and then dropped our anchor .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 22]: The next morning , when the day broke , the French line-of-battle ship was in the offing about eight miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 53]: It may easily be imagined that the French were very much annoyed at what had taken place ; their prizes re-captured , three boats lost , and their ship 's company weakened , and all by an inferior force close to them , and without any prospect of their having any revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 14]: But we , on the other hand , were not very pleasantly situated .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 64]: It is true that we were safe , but , at the same time , we were in prison , and could not hope for escape , unless some vessel came down to our assistance ; and how long we might be compelled to remain where we were , or what the chapter of accidents might bring about , no one could foresee .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 42]: About eight o'clock the French ship again stood in , and when as close as she dare come to us , she ran up and down , trying for deeper water on one side or the other , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 35]: She was within gun-shot of us , it is true , as we had run out into four fathoms ; but we could always trip our anchor when we pleased and stand further in .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 15]: At last she tried a shot at us , and it fell very close .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 30]: Captain Delmar did not , however , get under weigh and stand further in , although he ordered the capstern bars to be shipped , and the messenger passed .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 15]: A second and a third shot were fired , and one went over us .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 14]: At last the Frenchman anchored , and set to work in good earnest .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 29]: He found that he was within range , and as we did not move , presumed that we were in as shallow water as we could run into .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 71]: As the wind was still to seaward , we laid head on to him , and one of his shot struck us in the forefoot ; Captain Delmar then ordered the cable to be hove in and the anchor tripped , by which means we drifted in shore and increased our distance without his being aware of it , and his firing still continued , but without injury to us .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 38]: The reason for Captain Delmar 's doing this was evident ; he wished the French ship to continue firing , as the report of her guns might be heard and bring down some vessel to our assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 100]: At all events , such was not our good fortune on the first day , and I began to be tired of our situation ; so did Captain Delmar ; for on the second day he sent a boat to the recaptured vessels , which were at anchor inshore of us , directing them to heave up as soon as it was dark , and make the best of their way to Barbadoes , keeping well in shore till they got more to the northward ; this they did , and the following morning they were not in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 59]: The French ship still remained at anchor , and it appeared that she had been lightening so as to get further in ; for on that morning she weighed , and stood in to a mile and a half of us , and we were obliged to do the same , and run inshore out of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 21]: To effect this we anchored in three and a quarter fathoms , so that we actually stirred up the mud .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 77]: Towards the evening the wind fortunately shifted to off shore , and as soon as it was dark the captain ordered the anchor to be weighed , and we made all sail to the northward , trusting to our heels ; the following morning we had run seventy miles , and as the French ship was not to be seen , it was to be presumed that she was not aware of our having so done .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 13]: Ten days afterwards we dropped our anchor in Carlisle Bay , Barbadoes .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 31]: We found two men-of-war , both captains junior officers to our own , and I took this opportunity of passing my examination , which was a mere matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 39]: Having watered and taken in provisions , we then sailed for Jamaica , to join the admiral , who , upon Captain Delmar 's representation , immediately confirmed the acting order of lieutenant given to me by him .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 51]: A few days afterwards a packet arrived from England , and letters were received by Captain Delmar , informing him of the death of his elder brother and his succeeding to the title of Lord de Versely ; for his elder brother , although married , had no male issue .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 22]: Upon this intelligence , Captain Delmar immediately resigned the command of the Manilla , and another Captain was appointed to her .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 21]: I did not much like this , as I wished to remain with Captain Delmar , and gain his good-will .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 72]: I was , however , consoled by his sending for me , previous to his sailing for England in a frigate ordered home , and saying , `` Mr Keene , my duties in the House of Lords , and family affairs , require my presence in England , and I think it most probable that I now quit the service altogether ; but I shall not lose sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 30]: You have conducted yourself much to my satisfaction , and I will take care of your advancement in the service , if you only continue as you have begun .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 17]: I shall be happy to hear from you , if you will write to me occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 6]: I wish you every success .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 11]: Is there anything that I can do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 19]: `` I am most grateful , my lord , '' replied I , `` for all your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 26]: I had hoped to have been longer under your protection and guidance ; but I am aware that your high station must now prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 16]: If I might be so bold as to ask a favour , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 10]: `` Certainly , Keene , '' replied his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 4]: _ Keene _ !
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 49]: not _ Mr _ Keene , thought I. `` It is , sir , that I -- think I should have a better chance of doing something if I were to obtain the command of the Firefly schooner ; the lieutenant commanding her is about to invalid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 6]: `` I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 10]: I will speak to the admiral this very day .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 5]: Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 24]: `` Yes , my lord ; unless you think you could ask for Cross , your coxswain , to be appointed to her .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 18]: I should like to have a man on board whom I knew , and could trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 12]: `` I will see about it , and so good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 7]: His lordship held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 26]: I took it very respectfully ; he had never done so before , and the tears ran down my cheeks as I was quitting him .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 9]: His lordship observed it , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 28]: I left the cabin , quite overcome with his kindness , and so happy , that I would not have changed positions with the grand sultan himself .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 39]: Lord de Versely was faithful to his promise : the next day I received from the admiral my appointment to the Firefly , and , what was more unexpected , Bob Cross received a warrant as her boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 21]: This was a very kind act of Lord de Versely , and I was as much delighted as Bob himself .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 14]: I also received an invitation to dinner with the admiral on that day .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 68]: On my arrival at the house , a few minutes before dinner , the admiral called me aside to the verandah , and said to me , `` Mr Keene , I have not forgotten your cruise in the pirate schooner , and Lord de Versely has told me of your good behaviour in many instances since ; particularly of your conduct in the boats off Berbice .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 37]: In his despatches he has given you great praise , and I have added mine to back it ; so that if you only keep steady , you will command a sloop of war very soon .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 41]: You have now been seven months a lieutenant , for your commission will be confirmed to your first appointment ; a few months more , and I hope to see you with a commander 's commission in your pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 32]: I replied , that I was very grateful , and only hoped that he would send me out in the schooner to where I might prove myself deserving of his patronage .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 4]: `` Never fear .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 12]: I 'll find something for you to do , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 23]: By-the-bye , Lord de Versely told me last night , when we were alone , the history of the duel at Martinique .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 40]: You did well , Mr Keene ; I thank you in the name of our service -- it wo n't do for the soldiers to crow over us , though they are fine fellows , it must be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 10]: However , that secret had better be kept . ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 48]: `` Most certainly , sir , '' replied I. `` Now , then , there 's that black fellow come up to tell us dinner is ready ; so come along , or you 'll be where the little boat was -- a long way astern . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 18]: The admiral was very kind to me , and shook hands with me when I left him .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 45]: I returned on board of the Manilla , took leave of the surgeon , and master , and other officers , and then of all my mess-mates , and a boat was manned to take Bob Cross and me on board of the Firefly .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 22]: After the boat shoved off and was a little distance from the frigate , the men suddenly tossed up their oars .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 9]: `` What are you about , men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 18]: said I. `` Look there , sir , '' said Bob Cross , pointing to the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 41]: I turned round , and perceived all the men in the rigging , who gave me three cheers from a pipe of the boatswain ; a compliment which I had not dreamt of , and which moved me to tears .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 31]: I rose , and took off my hat ; the men in the boat returned the cheers , dropped their oars in the water , and rowed to the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 36]: I stepped on board , ordered the hands aft and read my commission , and then Cross 's warrant ; after which I went down into the cabin , for I wished to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 17]: I was now in command of a vessel , and not more than twenty years old .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 40]: I reflected what a career was before me , if I was fortunate , and never neglected an opportunity of distinguishing myself ; and I vowed that I never would , and prayed to Heaven to assist my endeavours .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 27]: Lord de Versely 's kindness to me had struck deep into my heart , and my anxiety was , that he should be proud of me .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 62]: And then I thought of the chances for and against me ; he might marry and have children ; that would be the worst thing that could happen to me : if he did not marry , his other brother had a large family , and the title would go to the eldest son ; but that was nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 21]: While I was summoning up all these contingencies in my mind , there was a knock at the cabin door .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 10]: `` Come in , '' said I. `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 6]: is it you , Cross ?
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 7]: I 'm glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 4]: Sit down there .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 12]: You see I command a vessel at last , Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 57]: `` Yes , sir ; and you 'll command a larger one before long , I hope ; but as to your being in command of a vessel -- there 's nothing very surprising in that ; what is surprising is , to find myself a warrant officer -- the idea never came into my head .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 25]: I must write , and tell my little girl of my good fortune ; it will make her and her mother very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 9]: `` I must do the same , Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 17]: My mother will be very much pleased to hear all I have to tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 24]: `` I have n't heard it myself yet , Mr Keene , and that 's why I came in , '' replied Bob .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 30]: `` I know you do n't want advice now ; but I ca n't help having a wish to know what took place between you and his lordship . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 32]: `` No one has a better right to know than you , Cross , who have been such a sincere friend to me ; so now I 'll tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 28]: I then entered into a detail of all that had passed between Lord de Versely and me , and also what the admiral had said to me .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 54]: `` All 's right , Mr Keene , '' replied Bob ; `` and let the admiral only give us something to do and I think you 'll believe me when I say that the boatswain of the Firefly will back you as long as he has a pin to stand upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 17]: `` That I 'm sure of , Bob ; you will ever be my right-hand man .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 19]: There are two midshipmen on board , I perceive : what sort of lads may they be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 28]: `` I have n't had time to find out ; but you have a capital ship 's company -- that the gunner and carpenter both say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 10]: `` And a very fine vessel , Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir , and a regular flyer , they say , if she is well managed .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 35]: You have never been in a schooner , Mr Keene , but I have , and for nearly three years , and I know how to handle one as well as most people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 15]: `` So much the better , Cross , for I know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 17]: Come , I will ring the bell ; I suppose some one will answer it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 6]: A lad made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 9]: `` Were you Mr Williams 's servant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 19]: `` Get me out a bottle of wine and some glasses -- there , that will do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 14]: `` Now , Bob , let 's drink success to the Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 17]: `` Here 's success to the Firefly , Mr Keene , and success to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 15]: May you do well in her , and be soon out of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 19]: `` Thank you , Bob : here 's your health , and may we long sail together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 12]: Bob and I finished the bottle , and then we parted .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 18]: The next day , I was very busy in examining my vessel and my ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 51]: The schooner was a beautiful model , very broad in the beam , and very low in the water ; she mounted one long brass thirty-two-pounder forward on a circular sweep , so that it could be trained in every direction ; abaft , she had four brass nine-pound carronades .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 26]: My ship 's company consisted of sixty men and officers ; that is , myself , two mids , boatswain , gunner , and carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 72]: The mids were young lads of about sixteen years of age , a Mr Brown and a Mr Black , gawky tall boys , with their hands thrust too far though the sleeves of their jackets , and their legs pulled too far through their trowsers ; in fact , they were growing lads , who had nothing but their pay to subsist upon , being both sons of warrant officers .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 65]: They bore very good characters , and I resolved to patronise them , and the first thing which I did was , to present them each with a new suit of uniform and a few other necessaries , so as to make them look respectable ; a most unheard-of piece of patronage , and which it is , therefore , my boast to record .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 51]: The fact is , I was resolved that my schooner should look respectable ; my ship 's company were really a very fine body of men , most of them tall and stout , and I had received a very good character of them from the officer who had invalided .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 23]: I had taken all his stores and furniture off his hands , for I had plenty of money , and to spare .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 60]: As soon as I had examined my ship 's company , I made them a speech , the which , although they were bound to hear it , I shall not inflict upon the reader , and I then went down and examined every portion of the vessel , ascertained what there was in her and where everything was .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 16]: Bob Cross accompanied me in this latter duty , which was not over till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 16]: The next morning my signal was made , and I went up to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 22]: `` Mr Keene , '' said the admiral , `` here are despatches to take down to the governor of Curacao .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 7]: When can you be ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 33]: `` Now , sir , '' replied I ; `` and if you will make the signal for the Firefly to weigh anchor , there will be so much time gained . ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 13]: `` Very good , Keene ; tell them to make the signal .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 14]: You must make all the haste you can , as they are important .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 36]: Here are your orders : after you have delivered your despatches , you will be allowed to cruise down in that quarter , as I understand there are some very mischievous vessels in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 24]: I hope you will give me a good account of one or two of them , if you fall in with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 21]: `` I will do my best , sir , '' replied I. `` Well , I sent you on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 24]: I have ordered the senior officer at Curacao to forward the return despatches by the Mosquito , that you may have a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 29]: I wo n't ask you to stay to dinner , as it is an affair that presses , so of course you will carry a press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 9]: Good-bye , and I wish you success . ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 14]: I took my leave of the admiral and hastened down to the town .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 32]: In an hour afterwards the Firefly was driving along with a fine breeze on the quarter , and long before night the vessels in the harbour were not to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 22]: The breeze freshened after the sun went down , and I remained on deck , carrying on to the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 35]: Bob Cross once or twice ventured to say , that we had better reduce the sail ; but I told Bob that the admiral was very anxious that I should make a quick passage .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 37]: `` Yes , Mr Keene , but ` turning the turtle ' is not making a quick passage , except to the other world , and the admiral does not wish his despatches to go there .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 33]: She is a fine boat , sir , but there may be too much sail carried on a good vessel : the men say she never has been so pressed before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 20]: `` Well , you are right , Bob , and so we will take a little off her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 38]: `` Yes , sir ; it 's my watch coming on now , and I will carry all she can bear with safety , and I think she will go quite as fast as she does now .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 14]: We shall have more wind yet , sir , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 27]: `` Well , so long as it is fair , I do n't mind how much , '' replied I. `` Send the watch aft . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 13]: We reduced the sail , and then I went down to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 9]: At daylight I awoke and went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 28]: The carpenter had the watch , for the watches were entrusted to the warrant officers , who were all good seamen , and accustomed to the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 29]: I found that the wind had freshened , but was steady from the same quarter , and the schooner was darting through the water at a tremendous rate .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 34]: `` She sails well , Mr Hayter , '' said I. `` Yes , sir , that she does , '' replied he ; `` and never sailed better than she does now .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 18]: I was a little alarmed for my sticks , last night , until you shortened sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 15]: `` Admiral 's order to carry a press of sail , Mr Hayter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 29]: `` Well , sir , then by Jove you obey orders ; you half frightened the men , although they had been so long in the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 16]: I felt , by what the carpenter had said , that I had been rash .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 44]: Neither he nor Bob Cross would have ventured so much if I had not been so ; and they understood the vessel better than I did , so I resolved to be guided by them until I felt able to judge for myself .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 37]: Notwithstanding that sail was afterwards carried more prudently , we had a most remarkably rapid passage ; for we took the breeze with us down the whole way , not seeing a vessel during the run .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 22]: I had another cause of impatience , which was , to ascertain if Mr Vanderwelt and Minnie had left the island .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 24]: On my arrival , I went first to the naval commanding officer , and then to the governor 's , delivering my credentials .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 10]: They complimented me on my having been so active .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 18]: I accepted the governor 's invitation to dinner , and then went to inquire after Mr Vanderwelt .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 24]: I walked first to his house , but found it occupied by a Scotch merchant , who , however , was very polite .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 80]: He stated that he was an old friend of Mr Vanderwelt , and could give me every information , as he had received letters from him very lately ; and that , in those letters , Mr Vanderwelt had informed him that I had said , in my last letter to them , that I was again on the West India station , and requested him , if I came to the island , to show me every attention .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 42]: `` So , my dear sir , '' continued Mr Fraser , `` I trust you will enable me to comply with my friend Mr Vanderwelt 's injunctions , and consider this house as your home during your stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 9]: I thanked Mr Fraser and accepted the offer .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 19]: I sent for my portmanteau , and slept there that night after I had dined with the governor .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 29]: At dinner I met Captain C -- , who told me he had orders to send me on a cruise , and asked when I would be ready .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 31]: I replied , that I should like a day or two to lift my rigging and overhaul it , as I had been very much strained in my passage down .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 21]: `` No wonder , '' replied he ; `` you must have flown -- indeed , your log proves it .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 13]: Well , I will send you as soon as you are ready .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 29]: The Naiad sloop is out , and so is the Driver brig , both in pursuit of three vessels , which have done a great deal of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 16]: One is a French brig of fourteen guns , very fast and full of men .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 16]: She has her consort , a large schooner , who is also a regular clipper .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 27]: The other vessel is a brigantine , a very fine vessel , built at Baltimore -- of course , under French colours : she cruises alone .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 51]: I do n't know how many guns she carries , but I suspect that both she and the brig will be too much for you ; and unless you could catch the schooner away from her consort , you will not be able to do much with the Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 33]: `` I will do my best , sir , '' replied I. `` I have a very fine set of men on board , and I think , very good officers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 37]: `` Well , at all events , if you ca n't fight , you have a good pair of heels to run with , '' replied Captain C -- ; `` but dinner 's announced . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 14]: I left early , that I might have some conversation with Mr Fraser .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 42]: On my return we sat down to some sangoree and cigars ; and then he told me that Mr Vanderwelt had left Curacao about nine months before , and that my last letter directed to him had been forwarded to Holland .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 50]: He had often heard the history of my saving their lives on board of the pirate vessel from Mr Vanderwelt who made it a constant theme of his discourse ; and , added Mr Fraser , `` You do not know what a regard he has for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 8]: `` And little Minnie , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 16]: inquired I : `` it is now nearly five years since I saw her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 17]: `` Little Minnie is no longer little Minnie , Mr Keene , I can assure you .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 21]: She was _ fifteen _ when she left the island , and had grown a tall and very beautiful girl .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 92]: All the young men here were mad about her and would have followed her not only to Holland , but to the end of the world , I believe , if they thought that they had the least chance -- but from my intimacy with the family , I tell you candidly , that I think if you were to meet again , you would not have a bad one ; for she talks incessantly of you when alone with her father : but I must not divulge family secrets . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 42]: `` I fear there is little chance of my meeting again with her , '' replied I : `` I have to carve my way up in my profession , and this war does not appear likely to be over soon .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 35]: That I should like to see her and her father again , I grant ; for I have made but few friendships during my life , and theirs was one of the most agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 7]: Where is Mr Vanderwelt settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 12]: `` He is not in Holland -- he is at Hamburg .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 29]: Well there is no saying ; accident may bring you together again , as it did on board of the pirate ; and I hope it may . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: Shortly afterwards we went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 35]: I must say , his description of Minnie , which was even much more in detail than I have narrated to the reader , did prevent my going to sleep for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 15]: Women , as the reader may have seen , never once troubled my thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 113]: I had fed upon one sole and absorbing idea , that of being acknowledged by Captain Delmar ; this was , and had been , the source and spring of every action , and was the only and daily object of reverie ; it was my ambition , and ambition in any shape , in whatever direction it may be led , is so powerful as to swallow up every other passion of the human mind ; but still I had a strong affection for Minnie -- that is for little Minnie , as I saw her first , with her beautiful large eyes and Madonna countenance , clinging to her father .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 57]: With the exception of my own relations , who were so much my seniors , I had had nothing to bestow my affections on -- had not even made the acquaintance , I may say , of a woman , unless my casual intercourse with Bob Cross 's Mary , indeed , might be so considered .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 61]: A passion for the other sex was , therefore , new to me ; but , although new , it was pleasing , and , perhaps , more pleasing , from being , in the present case , ideal ; for I had only a description of Minnie as she was , and a recollection of what she had been .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 26]: I could , therefore , between the two , fill up the image with what was , to my fancy , the ideal of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 25]: I did so again and again , until the night wore away ; and , tired out at last , I fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 50]: The next day , after I had been on board of the schooner , and given my orders to Bob Cross , I returned to Mr Fraser , and sat down to write to Mr Vanderwelt ; I also wrote to Minnie , which I had never done before .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 44]: That my night reveries had an effect on me is certain , for I wrote her a long letter ; whereas , had I commenced one before my arrival at Curacao , I should have been puzzled to have made out ten lines .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 68]: I told her I was sitting in the same chair , that I was sleeping in the same room , that I could not look around me without being reminded of her dear face , and the happy hours we passed together ; that Mr Fraser had told me how tall she had grown , and was no longer the little Minnie that used to kiss me .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 31]: In fact , I wrote quite romantically as well as affectionately , and when I read over my letter , wondered how it was that I had become so eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 21]: I begged Mr Vanderwelt to write to me as soon as possible , and tell me all about their doings .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 26]: I sealed my letter , and then threw myself back in my chair , and once more indulged in the reveries of the night before .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 23]: I had a new feeling suddenly sprung up in my heart , which threatened to be a formidable rival to my ambition .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 20]: In two days the Firefly was ready , and I reported her as being so to Captain C -- .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 38]: He gave me my orders , which were to cruise for six weeks , and then to rejoin the admiral at Port Royal , unless circumstances should make me think it advisable to return to the island .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 34]: The boats of the men-of-war were sent to tow me out of the harbour , and I was once more on the wide blue sea -- the schooner darting along like a dolphin .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 13]: For a fortnight we cruised without seeing any vessel but the Naiad .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 96]: I was very much afraid that the captain would have ordered me to keep company ; but as he considered his vessel quite a match for the brig and schooner if he should fall in with them , and did not want the prize-money to be shared with the crew of the Firefly , he allowed me to go my own way , saying to me , laughingly , as I went over the side , `` They will certainly take you if they meet you , and we shall have to recapture you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 26]: `` Well , I hope you will not forget your promise , sir , '' replied I ; `` I shall depend upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 48]: During the fortnight that I had been out , I had taken great pains in exercising the men at their guns , the great gun particularly ; and I had had an excellent sight put on it , which it had not , and very much required .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 57]: During two or three days ' calm , I had fired shot at a mark for three or four hours each day , and I found that the men , with this little practice , were very expert , and could hit a very small object , now that the sight was put on the gun .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 14]: The two best shots , however , were the gunner and Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 33]: The night after we parted from the Naiad , I had run to the southward , having heard from the captain that the Driver was more to the northward than he was .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 69]: There was nothing in sight on the next day , and when the evening set in , the wind being very light , and water smooth , I said to Cross , `` Suppose we furl sail at night -- it is just as good as running about ; we then shall see them if they come in our way , and they will not see us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 21]: `` A very good idea , Mr Keene ; we must keep a good look-out , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 48]: I followed up my own suggestion ; we furled the sails , and leaving two men with the officer of the watch to keep a sharp look-out , allowed the rest of the ship 's company to remain in the hammocks during the whole of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 42]: When day broke we had two look-out men at the mast-head , but remained with our sails furled as before , for the same reason , that we should discern a vessel by her sails long before she could discover us .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 26]: The more I thought of it , the more convinced I was of the advantage to be gained by the following up of this plan .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 25]: I was on the exact cruising ground I wished to be , and therefore could not do better while the weather remained so fine .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 39]: Four nights and three days we remained in this way ; during which my men had nothing to do but to exercise at the guns , and of that I took care they should have a good spell .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 17]: On the fourth night the wind was a little fresher , but the water quite smooth .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 22]: I had turned in about twelve o'clock , and had been asleep about an hour when Cross came and called me .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 15]: `` Well , Cross , '' said I , `` what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 8]: `` Here they are , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 5]: -- the privateers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 37]: `` Yes , sir ; the brig and schooner both coming down right before the wind ; they are on our weather quarter , and will pass us within two miles , if not nearer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 12]: I left my bed-place , and was dressed in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 24]: I went on deck with my glass , and directed it to the vessels , which were quite plain to the naked eye .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 20]: `` Put out the binnacle light , Cross , '' said I ; `` they might discover us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 19]: The brig , which was the headmost of the two vessels , was now nearly crossing our stern .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 10]: The schooner was about a mile astern of her .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 18]: `` Turn the hands up , Cross ; see all ready for action and making sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 9]: `` Not yet , sir , surely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 44]: `` No , not yet ; we will let them run two or three miles dead to leeward , and then follow them till daylight , or till they see us , when , of course , they will be after us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 85]: `` It 's very fortunate , sir , that we did furl the sails ; for had they come down , and we under sail , they would have seen us , and we should have been to leeward of them , which would have given us a poor chance against such odds ; now we shall have the weather-gage , and may choose , if our heels are as good as theirs , which I expect they are , if not better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 20]: `` I shall fight them in some shape or another , Bob , you may depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 16]: `` Of course you will , Mr Keene , or you 'll disappoint us all .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 16]: The ship 's company have every confidence in you , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 13]: `` Thanks to your long yarns , Bob , I presume . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 11]: `` Thanks to my telling the truth , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 20]: The schooner is right astern of us now , so there 's the weather-gage gone -- thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 55]: We remained as we were till I considered the two vessels sufficiently to leeward , and the sails were then set upon the Firefly , and first running to the eastward , so as to get right in the wind 's eye of them , I put the helm up , and followed them .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 36]: We had continued our course in their wake for about an hour , when day dawned , and the schooner , who had discovered us , fired a gun as a signal to her concert .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 14]: `` So you 've found us out at last , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 22]: said Bob Cross -- `` at all events , we keep a better look-out than you do , old fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 51]: Shortly after the gun was fired , both vessels hauled to the wind on the larboard tack , and we did the same : being about four miles to windward of the schooner and five or five and a half of the brig , we could now examine our adversaries .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 26]: The schooner was , apparently , about the same tonnage as the Firefly , a very beautiful vessel with her masts raking over her stern .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 69]: She was painted black , and we could not ascertain , at first , how many guns she carried , as her ports were shut ; but after a short time she knocked out her half ports to prepare for action , and then we discovered that she carried twelve guns , but not a long gun on a swivel like the one on board of the Firefly .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 61]: I observed this to Cross , who replied , `` Then , sir , all we have to do now is to try our rate of sailing with them , and if we are faster than they are we have not much to fear -- unless we lose a spar , indeed ; but luck 's all , Mr Keene .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 19]: The schooner has more sail on her than we have ; shall we set exactly the same ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 34]: `` No , Cross , for I think we have fore-reached upon her already , and , if we can beat her with less sail set , it will do just as well .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 21]: I think that the breeze is steady ; if anything , we shall have more than less of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 42]: For an hour we continued running on the same tack with them , by which time we found that we had not only brought the schooner one point abaft our beam , but had weathered her at least half a mile .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 14]: We therefore were fully satisfied that we had sailed better than the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 8]: With the brig it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 54]: Although we had brought the schooner two points abaft our beam , the brig was much in her former position , being still half a point abaft our beam , and moreover had come in much closer to the schooner , proving that we had neither weathered her , nor fore-reached upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 18]: As near as we could judge , our sailing with the brig was much upon a par .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 83]: Having ascertained this point more satisfactorily by allowing another hour of trial , I desired the men to get their breakfasts , while I and the officers did the same , and as soon as that was done , I ordered the Firefly to be kept away -- edging down till within good range of our long brass thirty-two-pound gun -- that is , about one mile and a half -- when we again hauled our wind and hoisted the English colours .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 37]: The tri-colour was immediately thrown up by the two Frenchmen , and a shot was fired at us by the schooner : it fell exhausted into the water about half a cable 's length from us .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 25]: `` Now , Cross , '' said I , `` see if we ca n't return the compliment with a little better success . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 50]: Cross , who had been training the gun , and had his eye on the sight , waited for a second or two , and fired : we saw the shot pass through the first reef of his main-sail , and dash into the water to leeward of him .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 15]: `` Very good that , Cross ; but hull him if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 42]: The schooner now returned the fire with the whole broadside , apparently twelve pounders ; but they did not throw so far as our long thirty-two-pounder , and no shot went over us , although one fell close under the stern .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 34]: At the distance , therefore , that we were , we had everything in our favour and my object was to dismantle the schooner before any chance enabled the brig to assist her .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 44]: We continued to fire at her , taking the greatest pains in our aim , for the next hour , during which we ascertained that we had hulled her more than once , and had very much cut up her spars and rigging .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 11]: She continued to return the fire , but without effect .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 29]: One or two shots hit us , but their force was so much spent by the distance they were propelled , that they did not enter the sides .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 25]: At last a shot fired by the gunner did the job ; it struck her foremast , which shortly afterwards went by the board .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 10]: The Fireflies gave three cheers at the good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 12]: `` She 's done for , sir , '' said Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 15]: `` Now for the brig -- we must try what metal she carries . ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 25]: `` Stop a bit , '' said I , `` Cross ; we must give the schooner a little more before she gets away .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 33]: They have lowered down the main-sail and I presume , intend getting up some head-sail , so as to pay off , and run under the lee of the brig for shelter .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 22]: Put the helm up , and run down so as to keep the schooner about two points on our larboard bow .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 12]: Get the gun round , and pitch it into her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 85]: As we had supposed , the schooner got a stay up from her bowsprit and to her mainmast head , and hoisted a fore and aft sail upon it , that she might pay off , and run down to her consort for support ; but as we ran three feet to her one , and now stood directly for her , we were enabled to get close to her , and put several shots into her from our long gun as we advanced .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 24]: She did not attempt to round to , to give us her broadside , and our raking shot must have had great effect .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 37]: When within half a mile of her we rounded to , and gave her our broadside ; for had we followed her any further we should have been closer to the brig than might be agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 61]: Indeed , we were nearer than we thought , for she had continued to hug the wind , and was so weatherly , that she was not more than a mile to leeward of us when we rounded to the wind again ; but as she had fore-reached upon the schooner , she was distant from us about two miles .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 27]: As we rounded to the brig tacked , and we immediately did the same ; and we now had a fair trial of sailing with her .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 27]: `` Cross , let the men go down and get what they can to eat , '' said I , `` and get up the grog .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 16]: We shall have plenty of work before the night is over , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 24]: `` We must make a running fight of it , sir , I expect , for she is too heavy for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 70]: `` I shall try her the same way as the schooner , Cross , '' replied I. `` If I can only knock away some of her spars without losing my own , I shall then be able to do something ; if , on the contrary , we lose our spars , and she gets alongside of us , why then we must fight to the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 62]: `` I consider that schooner as our own , '' replied Bob ; `` she must haul down her colours when no longer protected by the brig. '' `` Yes ; I was afraid that she would run away to leeward altogether ; but I see she has rounded to , and is no doubt getting up a jury fore-mast . ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 19]: I allowed the men to remain an hour at their dinner , and then they were summoned up .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 31]: During the hour we found the rate of sailing between us and the brig so nearly balanced , that it was impossible to say which had the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 30]: `` Now , my lads , we will wear round , and get a little closer to this fellow , and see what we can do with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 21]: The men were full of spirits and hope , and were as anxious to decide the question as I was .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 30]: In ten minutes we passed the brig within a mile on opposite tacks , and had given her our long gun three times , and had received her broadside .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 23]: `` He has long twelve-pounders , I think , sir , '' said Cross ; `` smart guns , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 19]: There 's a fore shroud and a back stay gone ; but that 's no great matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 18]: As soon as the brig was three points abaft the beam we tacked , and recommenced firing .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: Not a shot was thrown away by my men .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 18]: I believe the brig was hulled every time ; nor was her fire without effect upon us .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 24]: Our rigging was much cut up ; several of her shots had gone through our sails , and we had two men hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 14]: I was annoyed at this , as we had no surgeon on board .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 26]: The assistant surgeon who had belonged to the schooner was at the hospital , and there was not one to replace him when we sailed .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 32]: However , we had one of the men belonging to the hospital -- a sort of dispenser -- who knew very well how to manage anything that was not very serious .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 37]: The breeze had gradually died away , and we did not go more than three miles through the water ; and as our sails were much torn , we did not hold so good a wind .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 30]: The consequence was that the distance between us and our antagonist was , by two o'clock , decreased to half a mile , and the fight became very warm .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 41]: Our broadside guns were now called into play , and assisted us very much , as we directed them chiefly at her sails and rigging , while our long thirty-two-pounder was fired at her hull , pointed below her water-line .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 23]: She had the advantage in number of guns , certainly ; but our large shots from the long gun were more destructive .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 41]: About three we knocked away her fore-topmast , which enabled us to shoot ahead about a quarter of a mile , and increase our distance , which was a boon to us , for we latterly had suffered very much .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 23]: We had eight men wounded and one of my poor middies killed ; and we had received several shots in the hull .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 101]: Now that we had increased our distance , we had a better chance , as our long gun was more effective than those of the brig. At five o'clock it fell dead calm , and both vessels lay with their heads round the compass ; this was also in our favour , as we could train our long gun on its circular bend in any direction we pleased ; but the brig contrived , by getting sweeps out of her bow ports , to bring her broadside to bear upon us , and the action continued till night closed in .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 55]: As it may be supposed , my men were completely worn out with the fatigue and excitement of the day ; and Cross said , `` There 's no saying how this will end , Mr Keene ; but , at all events , we have not the worst of it at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 20]: `` No , Bob , '' replied I. `` I wish the men were not so knocked up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 59]: `` Oh , as for that , sir , I 'll answer for it , that if you serve out some more grog , make them eat half a biscuit at the tub before they drink it , and make them a little bit of a speech , that they 'll go on for twenty-four hours more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 27]: `` If that will have the effect , I 'm sure I 'll try it , '' replied I. `` Which shall they have first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 16]: `` Oh , biscuit first , grog next , and then a speech afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 59]: `` That fellow has not fired for this last five minutes ; perhaps he wishes to put it off till to-morrow morning ; but I 'll not ; so get up the grog -- make it pretty strong : and I 'll get something to eat myself , for I have had nothing to eat all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 39]: As soon as the ship 's company had had their refreshment , I sent for them aft , and said , `` My lads , you have behaved very well , and I am much obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 55]: We have had hard work , and I dare say you are tired enough ; but I will tell you what my opinion is : I think that we have peppered that Frenchman very well ; and I am convinced that you have put a good many shots into him between wind and water .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 42]: Now , that he is anxious to leave off fighting till to-morrow morning , that he may stop his leaks and repair his damages , I have no doubt ; indeed , he proves it by his having ceased to fire .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 57]: For the very reason that he wants to leave off , I wish to go on ; for he is much heavier armed than we are , and sails as well ; and if we permit him to get all right and all ataunt by to-morrow morning , he may prove a very awkward customer yet .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 29]: Now what I propose is this , that we should first get up fresh sails , and bend them , and then renew the action through the night .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 26]: There will be no occasion for all of you to be on deck ; we will fight the schooner watch and watch till daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 14]: `` That 's my opinion , Mr Keene , '' said Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 9]: `` And mine , '' replied the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 19]: `` And all of us , Mr Keene , '' replied the ship 's company with one voice .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 29]: `` Then , my lads , let 's work hard ; and when we have settled that fellow , we shall have plenty of time to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 28]: The men now set to with good-will ; and the spare sails were got up , and those which were shattered by the enemy unbent and replaced .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 44]: The new sails , which we had bent , we furled -- it was a dead calm -- and then we recommenced our fire , for we were nearer to her than when we ceased firing , and could distinguish her very well .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 45]: We fired the long gun four times before she returned a shot ; she then opened very briskly , but none of her shots did us any damage ; our sails being furled , prevented her distinguishing us as well as we could her .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 39]: After a time , we manned the small guns on our broadside , and worked them , for our large gun was so hot , that it was necessary to let it cool before we could reload it .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 36]: At last one of their shots came in through the bulwarks ; the splinters wounded me and the carpenter ; but I was not so much hurt as to oblige me to leave the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 19]: I bound up my leg with my handkerchief ; the carpenter , however , was taken down below .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 9]: `` Are you much hurt , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 4]: said Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 21]: `` Oh , no ; the flesh is lacerated a good deal , but it is not very deep . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 20]: `` There 's a little wind springing up , sir , from the right quarter , '' said Bob .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 22]: `` I 'm glad to hear it , '' replied I , `` for it will soon be daylight now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 41]: At this moment another shot struck the hammock rail and a piece of it about two feet long was sent with great force against Bob Cross 's head ; he was stunned , if not worse , and fell immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 15]: This was a severe blow to me , as well as to poor Bob .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 45]: I desired two of the men who were abaft , to take him down into my cabin , and do all they could for him ; and ordered the men to quit the broadside guns , and renew their fire with the long 32-pounder .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 45]: In a quarter of an hour afterwards , the breeze came down very strong , and I resolved to shoot ahead , farther off from my antagonist , as I should have a better chance by using my long gun at a greater distance .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 36]: The sails were set , and the schooner went fast through the water , leaving the brig , who had also the benefit of the breeze ; and for a time the firing again ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 28]: On reflection , I determined that I would wait till daylight , which would appear in less than half an hour , before I renewed the action .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 33]: I contrived with some difficulty -- for my leg was so numbed that I could scarcely feel that I had one -- to go down into the cabin and see Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 10]: He was recovering , but very wild and incoherent .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 34]: As far as I could judge , his skull was not injured , although the splinter had torn off a large portion of the scalp , and he was drenched with his blood .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 53]: At all events , he could be of no further assistance to me at present , nor could I be to him , so I regained the deck , and sat down abaft , for my leg had become so painful , that I could not stand but for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 17]: At last the day dawned , and I could distinctly make out both brig and schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 68]: I was about a mile and a half distant from the brig ; she had , since the wind sprung up , driven a mile ahead of the schooner , who had contrived to get up a jury-mast during the night ; but as she could not stir without reducing her after-sail , she had close-reefed her main-sail , so that she could make but little progress .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 55]: The brig was very much cut up in her sails and rigging , and I saw at once that I had now the advantage in sailing ; I therefore wore round and stood towards them ; the brig did the same , and went down to the schooner that she might have her support .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 23]: We immediately recommenced firing with our long gun , and as soon as we were within a mile , I hove to .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 46]: The brig and schooner then both bore up and gave us their broadsides ; they had just done so , when the midshipman who was on deck with me cried out , `` A large sail coming down before the wind , Mr Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 6]: I caught up my glass .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 17]: It was a sloop of war ; the cut of her sails and rigging evidently English .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 19]: `` It must be the Naiad , '' said I. `` Well , I 'm glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 23]: We shall lose some prize-money ; but at all events we require her surgeon , and that is of more consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 20]: My men , who were quite tired out , were in great spirits at the appearance of a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 33]: The brig had set studding-sails ; she had evidently seen the vessel to windward , and was now trying to escape , and the schooner was following her as well she could .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 20]: I immediately kept away in pursuit , and when I fired into the schooner she hauled down her colours .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 29]: I did not wait to take possession , but followed the brig , who appeared to sail as well off the wind as she did when close hauled .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 37]: Once or twice she rounded to return my fire , but afterwards she continued running before the wind , having got two of her guns aft , with which she attempted to cut away my rigging .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 49]: In the meantime , the strange vessel to windward had hoisted English colours , and was bringing down with her a spanking breeze : fortunately it was so , for my fore-topmast was knocked away by the fire of the brig , and I now dropped fast astern .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 43]: We had scarcely got up a new fore-topmast and set sail again , when the Naiad , who had exchanged numbers with me , passed the schooner without taking possession of her , and was very soon not a mile from us .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 61]: In half an hour she was alongside and hailing me to haul my wind and take possession of the schooner , continued in chase of the brig. I obeyed my orders , and by the time I had put my men on board of the schooner , the brig had hove to and hauled down her colours to the Naiad .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 21]: We ran down to her in company with the prize , and then sent a boat requesting immediate surgical attendance .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 39]: The Naiad 's surgeon and his assistant were brought on board in one of the sloop-of-war 's boats , and a lieutenant , to obtain from me the particulars of the action , which I gave to him .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 58]: The lieutenant told me that they had heard the firing about one o'clock in the morning , and had in consequence bore up ; but the brig had so many shot in her , and was making so much water , that they were almost afraid that they would not be able to get her into port .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 24]: But I was now quite faint with the pain of my wound and exhaustion , and was carried below to have it dressed .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 29]: All our men had been attended to , and I was glad to hear that Bob Cross was in no danger , although his wound was very severe .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 36]: The surgeon 's assistant was allowed to remain on board , and the captain of the Naiad sent all my men back and manned the prizes , giving me orders to keep company with him .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 28]: As soon as my wound was dressed , and I was put into my bed , I felt much relieved , and soon afterwards fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 51]: The prizes proved to be the Diligente brig , of fourteen guns , and two hundred and ten men , and Caroline schooner , of eight guns , and one hundred and twenty men -- they had done a great deal of mischief , and their capture was of importance .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 21]: The captain of the Naiad 's orders were to return to Curacao , and we all made sail before sunset .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 25]: Our loss had been severe : commanding officer , boatswain , carpenter , and twelve men wounded -- one midshipman and two men killed .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 23]: The next morning our signal was made to pass within hail , and the captain of the Naiad inquired how I was .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 39]: The surgeon 's assistant replied that I and all the wounded were doing well , and there was no more communication till we arrived at Curacao on the fourth day , by which time I was rapidly recovering .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 34]: Mr Fraser , as soon as he heard of my being hurt , immediately came on board and insisted upon my being taken on shore to his house , and I gladly consented .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 22]: The next day I had a visit from Captain C , the commanding officer , and the captain of the Naiad .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 17]: Captain C asked me if I was well enough to write the account of the action .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 16]: I replied that I was , and that I would send it the next day .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 54]: He and the captain of the Naiad both paid me many compliments for having fought a superior force for so long a time , and Captain C said that as soon as I was well enough he would send me up to Jamaica , as bearer of my own despatches to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 31]: I requested , as a particular favour of Mr Fraser , that he would allow Bob Cross to be sent ashore to his house , and Mr Fraser immediately consented .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 19]: My friend Bob was therefore brought up that evening , and was soon established in very comfortable quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 28]: We had been a fortnight at the island , during which my wound was healing rapidly , and I was able to hop about with a crutch .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 44]: Cross also was out of bed , and able to sit up for an hour or two on the verandah , in the cool of which I spent the best part of the day , with my wounded limb resting upon a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 54]: From the veranda we had a view of the harbour , and one morning I perceived that there were two additional vessels which had anchored during the night ; they proved to be the Driver and the brigantine privateer , which she had captured after a chase and running fight of forty-eight hours .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 18]: I was glad of this , as I knew what pleasure it would give to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 29]: I now again indulged in my dreams of Minnie , who had been forgotten as soon as I had left the harbour and been engaged in active service .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 28]: Stretched upon a sofa , with my wounded leg , I had nothing else to do , or rather nothing else which was so agreeable to me .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 31]: I wrote to her again , and also to my mother ; neither did I forget that Lord de Versely had requested at parting that I should write to him .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 14]: I did so in a very respectful manner , detailing what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 36]: When we had been three weeks at Curacao , all our wounded , as well as myself , had so far recovered , that there was no reason for the Firefly not proceeding to Jamaica .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 10]: The commanding officer lent an assistant-surgeon to the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 24]: I received my despatches , took a grateful leave of Mr Fraser , and the Firefly was once more skimming over the water .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 16]: In three weeks we arrived at Port Royal , and I took up my despatches .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 13]: `` Happy to see you , Keene , '' said the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 3]: `` Hollo !
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 8]: what makes you limp in that way ?
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 7]: Have you hurt your leg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 28]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied I ; `` I 'm not quite well yet , but the despatches of Captain C will explain all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 18]: As no vessel had sailed from Curacao , the admiral had no idea of what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 26]: `` Well , then , '' said he , `` sit down on that sofa , Mr Keene , while I read the despatches . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 25]: I watched the admiral 's countenance , and was delighted to witness the evident signs of satisfaction which he expressed as he read on .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 4]: `` Excellent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 8]: said he , as he closed them .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 11]: `` Keene , you have done me a great favour .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 38]: The remonstrances of the merchants , the badgering I have received from the Admiralty by every packet , relative to the depredations on our commerce by these vessels , have been enough to make a saint swear .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 17]: Now they are happily disposed of , and I have chiefly to thank you for it .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 26]: Captain C informs me that the brig is well adapted for his Majesty 's service , but that the schooner is an old vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 7]: The admiral then left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 96]: In a few minutes he returned with a paper in his hand , which he laid upon the table , and , taking up a pen , he signed it and presented it to me , saying -- '' _ Captain _ Keene , I trust you will give me the pleasure of your company to dinner ; and , as you are still very lame , I think you had better make a signal for your servant and traps , and take up your quarters at the Penn till you are quite recovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 52]: Perceiving that I was too much agitated to reply , he continued , `` I must leave you now ; '' then extending his hand , he said , `` Allow me to be the first to wish you joy on your promotion , which you have so well deserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 8]: He then went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 20]: It really was so unexpected -- so little dreamt of , this sudden promotion , that I was confused .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 41]: I had hoped that , by a continuance of good conduct , I might in a year or two obtain it ; but that I should receive it after only one cruise in the schooner was beyond all my imagination .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 27]: I felt grateful , and as soon as I was more composed , I returned thanks to Heaven , and vowed eternal gratitude to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 27]: I felt that I was a step nearer to Lord de Versely , and I thought of the pleasure it would give my mother and Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 14]: I had been alone about half an hour , when the admiral returned .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 51]: `` I have just sent for an old messmate of yours , Captain Keene , who was severely wounded in your action with the Dutch frigate ; he has now passed , and Lord de Versely recommended him to me as a deserving young officer -- a Mr Dott . ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 18]: `` Oh , yes , admiral ; he was my first acquaintance when I went to sea .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 21]: He has been to sea longer than I have , but he lost a good deal of his time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 25]: `` Well I am going to give him an acting order for your brig. I hope he is a good , smart officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 19]: `` Yes , admiral , he is a very good officer indeed , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 24]: `` Will you oblige me by not telling him that I am to be his captain , till after we have met ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 24]: `` Ah , some mischief , I suppose ; but if we make captains of such boys as you we must expect that .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 10]: Are your wounded men all going on well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 25]: `` All , sir , -- even Bob Cross , the boatswain , whose head was half knocked off , is quite well again .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 22]: He was Lord de Versely 's coxswain , sir , and you were kind enough to give him his warrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 13]: `` I recollect -- a good man , is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 27]: `` So good , sir , that the only regret I have in leaving the schooner is , that I can not take him with me .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 28]: He is my right-hand man and I owe much to him , and it will be a sore blow to him as well as to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 18]: `` I see , you want him made boatswain of your brig -- that 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 20]: `` I assure you , admiral , I should be most grateful if you would have that kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 23]: `` I am always ready to promote a good man ; your recommending him , and his severe wound , are sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 9]: He shall be your boatswain , Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 23]: `` You are very kind , sir , '' replied I. `` I hope I shall do justice to your patronage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 34]: `` I 've no fear of that , Keene , and I know that a man , to work well , should , as far as he can , choose his own tools .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 25]: Mr Dott is waiting now , and as soon as he has his acting order , I will send him in to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 40]: About ten minutes afterwards Mr Tommy Dott made his appearance ; he extended his hand to me , saying , in a haw-haw way , `` Keene , my dear fellow , I 'm glad to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 17]: He certainly did look two or three inches taller , for he walked almost on tiptoe .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 21]: `` Glad to see you , Tommy , '' said I ; `` well , what 's the news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 12]: `` Nothing , I believe , except what you have brought .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 15]: I hear you had a bit of a brush , and got winged . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 16]: `` Even so , Tommy , '' replied I , pointing to my wounded leg .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 16]: `` The admiral has kindly asked me to stay here until I 'm better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 26]: `` I dine with him to-day , '' replied Tommy ; `` but as for staying here , I should think that rather a bore .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 23]: By the bye , Keene , what sort of a craft is that Diligente brig which the Naiad and you took ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 16]: `` A very fine craft , Tommy : sails as well as the Firefly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 61]: `` Oh , you , of course , swear by your own vessel ; and there 's nothing like the schooner -- that 's natural enough ; now , I must say , I prefer something a little larger , and , therefore , I 'm not sorry that I have my commission for the new brig. '' `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 23]: Tommy ; I wish you joy , '' replied I. `` Thank ye , Keene , '' replied Tommy , very dignified .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 18]: `` I wonder , '' said he , `` what sort of a skipper we shall have .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 13]: There 's the first lieutenant of the Naiad has a good chance .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 26]: I saw him : a very sharp sort of gentleman , and carries his head remarkably high ; but that wo n't do for me .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 18]: I 'll not allow any captain to play tricks in a ship that I 'm aboard of .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 32]: I know the rules and regulations of the service as well as any one , and that the captain shall see , if he attempts to go beyond his tether . ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 58]: `` Now , Tommy , '' replied I , `` you know , that although you talk so big , if you had been appointed a lieutenant into a ship commanded by Lord de Versely , you would have been as much afraid of him as a lieutenant as you used to be as a midshipman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 28]: `` Lord de Versely , '' replied Tommy , who felt the truth of what I said : `` he 's a peculiar sort of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 60]: `` Take my word for it , Tommy , you 'll find all captains peculiar to one point ; which is , that they expect respectful behaviour , and not cavilling , from their officers ; and our service is so peculiar , that it is absolutely necessary that the officers should set this example to the men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 43]: `` Yes ; that may be very well ; but who knows but the captain of the brig may be some young fellow , who has seen no more service than myself -- perhaps , not been to sea so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 31]: `` That is no reason that you should not obey his orders ; indeed , if not experienced , you ought to do all you can to support him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 32]: `` Well , if he was to ask my advice , indeed -- '' `` But he may not require your advice , Tommy , he may prefer deciding for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 39]: Now , the first lieutenant of the Naiad is a great Tartar , and I 'm certain , if he is your captain , that , on the first word , he would have you under an arrest .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 30]: There 's an old saying , Tommy , ` It 's folly to kick against tenpenny nails ; ' and that every officer does who kicks against his superior .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 22]: I can assure you , Tommy , that if ever I am a captain , my officers shall obey me implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 9]: I will have no cavilling at my orders .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 49]: I will always treat them as gentlemen , and support their authority , as they ought to support mine ; but captain of my own ship I would be , and I suspect that it would go hard with any officer who ventured to dispute my rights . ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 26]: `` Well , I dare say you will be a martinet , or rather that you are one now , as you command a schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 17]: However , as I never intend to sail with you , that 's nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 35]: I 'm sure , from what has passed , that you and I should have a row before we were a week on board ; for I 'm not to be played with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 24]: `` Well , Tommy , I 'm very glad we have had this explanation ; for now we both know what to expect .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 14]: I am resolved to be captain , you to resist my authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 30]: `` No , no , I do n't say that -- I only say that I wo n't be played with -- I wo n't be trifled with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 22]: `` Tommy , I will neither play nor trifle with you ; nor will you ever play or trifle with me .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 23]: We have done that as midshipmen ; in our new relative situations it is not to be thought of for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 4]: Read this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 36]: I handed him my appointment as commander of the Diligente : Tommy cast his eyes over it , and at once saw that his promotion did not prevent his getting into scrapes , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 5]: `` You a commander !
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 6]: you captain of the Diligente !
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 10]: Why , I came to sea before you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 31]: `` I know you did , Tommy ; but , although you have been in the service longer , you have not seen quite so much service as I have .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 10]: At all events , I 'm now your captain .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 97]: I flatter myself I shall make a very tolerable one ; and what is more , I have an idea that you will make a very good lieutenant , as soon as the vanity , with which you have been puffed up since your receiving your promotion , will have settled down a little , and that you will find it much pleasanter to be on good terms with your captain than to be eternally in hot water , especially with one who , you know , is not a person to be played with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 25]: Tommy looked very confused ; he said nothing , but kept his eyes on my commission , which he still held in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 26]: I had no idea that Tommy Dott 's being ignorant of my being captain of the brig would have occasioned such a conversation as this .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 16]: I only wished to amuse myself with him , and surprise him at the last .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 58]: Tommy perceived that he had made a mess of it , and he stammered out some explanation as he returned me the commission ; and I replied : `` The fact is , Dott , you were merely cutting a caper upon your new promotion ; you never meant what you said ; it was all talk .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 33]: You always have been very obedient to proper authority since I have known you , and I am sure that you always will ; so let 's say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 26]: I wish you joy upon your promotion , and , what 's more , I 'm very glad that we are to sail together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 25]: Saying this , I held out my hand , which Tommy took very readily , and we then began to talk on other subjects .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 20]: I had written to Cross , informing him of my promotion , and his being appointed to the Diligente .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 49]: I had been a fortnight with the admiral when the Naiad arrived with the prizes in company , and , my wound being now cured , I took leave of the admiral , and went down , that I might superintend the fitting out of my new vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 47]: As there were supernumerary men expected out of England , the admiral , at my suggestion , allowed me to turn over the crew of the Firefly to form the nucleus of my ship 's company , and made up my complement from his own ship .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 16]: In two months I was ready for sea , and most anxious to be off .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 38]: The admiral perceived my impatience , but , as there was no other vessel in the harbour , he would not let me go until another arrived , to be at his disposal in case of emergency .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 41]: The weariness of so long remaining in harbour was , however , a little relieved by a circumstance which took place , and which probably will make my readers imagine that my propensity for playing tricks was not quite eradicated .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 28]: I lodged at a sort of hotel , kept by a mulatto woman of the name of Crissobella , as the negroes termed her , originally Christobela .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 19]: She was of Spanish blood by the father 's side , and had come down from the Havannah .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 63]: She was very portly ; very proud and dignified in her carriage , and demanded as much attention from her lodgers as a lady would who had received us as her guests , so that , to gain and retain admittance into her hostelry , it was necessary not only to pay a large bill , but compliments to an equal amount .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 18]: She was very rich , possessed numerous slaves , and was perfectly independent of keeping an hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 49]: I believed she preferred to have something for her slaves and herself to do , and moreover , probably , she felt that if she retired she should be thought a person of no consequence , whereas in her present position she received a great deal of attention .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 70]: One thing was certain , that if those who lodged and boarded with her were very polite , and , on their return from any other place , brought her small presents , she was very indifferent as to their paying their bill ; nay , to those who were her favourites , her purse was open , and a handful of doubloons was freely tendered , if required .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 10]: The living was the same as at a boarding-house .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 25]: Breakfast was ready in the large hall by nine o'clock , and remained there until every one had come down at their own hour .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 16]: Dinner was always ready at five o'clock , and then Crissobella presided at the table .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 27]: She admitted civilians , army officers , and navy , down to midshipmen ; but warrant officers and captains of merchant vessels were considered too low .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 29]: On the whole , it was a very pleasant establishment , as the private rooms were well furnished , the slaves numerous , and the attendance very good .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 37]: Considering the price of most eatables on that island , it could not be considered as very dear , although the wines , etcetera , made up a formidable bill at the end of the month .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 29]: This kind of exclusiveness on the part of Signora Crissobella made the hotel quite the fashion , and certainly it was by far the best in the town .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 84]: The inmates of it at this time were besides me Lieut. Thomas Dott and Lieut. William Maxwell , both appointed to the Diligente ; three or four young civilians , on mercantile speculations from New York ; three midshipmen , who had been left behind on account of fever , and who were promising fair , by the life they were now leading , to be very soon sent to the hospital again ; and one or two planters from the other islands .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 23]: The latter and I were very well behaved , but the civilians were noisy , drinking and smoking from morning till night .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 54]: The midshipmen were equally troublesome ; and as for the new-made lieutenants , they were so authoritative and so disagreeable , and gave themselves such consequential airs , that Mammy Crissobella , as the slaves called her , was quite indignant -- she had never had such a disorderly set in her house .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 18]: She complained to me , and I spoke to them , but that was of little use .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 20]: I had no power over the young merchants , and the three midshipmen did not belong to my ship .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 26]: As for my lieutenants , I could not say much at their giving themselves airs at an hotel where they paid for what they had .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 12]: It was not an offence that a captain could remonstrate upon .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 40]: I therefore merely said , that Mammy Crissobella could not have them in her house if they did not leave off their treatment of the slaves , and if they continued to give her so much trouble and annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 51]: At last our hostess would stand their behaviour no longer , and ordered them all to leave the hotel , sending in their bills ; but they all were unanimous in declaring that they would not go , and it was not very easy to use force on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 18]: I tried all I could to make matters right , but my efforts were of little avail .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 8]: At last Mammy Crissobella became quite furious .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 56]: She did not make any alteration in the meals , as that would be punishing all of us ; but she refused wine and spirits ; this they did not care for , as they sent for it elsewhere by their own servants , and there was nothing but noise and confusion all day along .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 42]: Mammy often came to appeal to me , and wished to go to the governor , but I persuaded her not to do so ; and the mutiny continued , and every day there was nothing but altercation at the meals .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 12]: `` So help me God , gemmen , you no gemmen .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 10]: You make wish me dead , dat you do .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 7]: I tak obeah water some day .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 11]: I not live like this , '' said Mammy Crissobella .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 10]: `` I take pepper-pot -- I kill myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 24]: `` Pray do n't do that , '' replied Tommy Dott ; `` we shall be put to the expense of mourning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 17]: `` And I shall weep my eyes out , '' continued one of the mercantile gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 10]: `` Weep your eyes out -- is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 11]: I shall blow my brains out , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 17]: `` And I will lie down on your grave and die , '' said the third .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 19]: `` Dat all very well , gemmen ; you say dat and laugh -- but I no slave .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 26]: ` Pose I not get you out my house , I ab _ vengeance _ , now I tell you , so look to that .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 20]: Yes , '' continued Mammy Crissobella , striking the table with her fist , `` I ab revenge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 34]: `` I have been thinking , '' said one of the mids , `` what I shall do if Mammy Crissobella takes pepper-pot ; I shall marry Leila , and keep the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 12]: Mammy , you 'll leave me the plate and furniture . ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 36]: Leila was the head female slave -- a very well-featured young mulatto girl , and a great favourite , as she was always laughing , always in good humour , and very kind and attentive .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 32]: At this remark Leila laughed , and Mammy Crissobella , who observed her showing her white teeth , `` You laugh , you huzzy : what you laugh for , Leila ?
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 8]: Get away -- get out of room .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 8]: I give you nice flogging , by-by .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 14]: You dare laugh -- you take side against me , you nigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 66]: I must here observe that Mammy Crissobella had been closeted with me for some time previous to this scene , and that Leila and the two planters were in the secret ; this was , of course , unknown , and the hostess 's anger appeared now to be extended towards me and the two planters , with whom she had been on good terms .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 30]: Shortly afterwards Mammy rose and left the room , and then I spoke to the party , and told them that they were driving the poor woman to extremities .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 41]: The planters agreed with me , and we argued the case with them , but the majority were , of course , against us , and the young merchants appeared to be very much inclined to be personal with me .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 48]: At last I replied , `` Very well , gentlemen -- as you please ; but as I happen to be well known both to the admiral and governor I give you fair warning that , if this continues much longer , I will report the affair .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 33]: I should be very sorry to do so ; but the house is now very uncomfortable , and you have no right to remain when the landlady insists upon your going . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 22]: At this reply of mine the naval portion of the guests were silent , but the civilians more insolent than before .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 21]: I did not wish to come to open war , so I said nothing more , and left the table .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 14]: After I was gone , the refractory parties made more noise than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 31]: Just before the dinner hour on the following day , Mammy Crissobella sent a circular round to the young men , stating that she could not receive them at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 12]: They all laughed , and went down to table as before .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 14]: The dinner was better than usual , and they complimented Mammy upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 31]: Mammy , who had taken her seat with a scowl on her brow , and had not spoken a word , merely bowed her head in reply to their observations .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 33]: Dinner was over , and then Mammy desired Leila to bring her a goblet which was on the sideboard , and a small white jug which was in the _ buffet _ .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 30]: She appeared much distressed , and hesitated a good deal , putting the goblet to her lips , and then putting it down on the table without tasting it .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 11]: This conduct induced us all to look seriously at her .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 19]: At last she took it up , sighed deeply , and drank the whole off at a draught .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 20]: For a few seconds she held her hand over her forehead , with her elbows resting on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 62]: At last she looked up and said , `` Gemmen , I got a little speech to make -- I very sorry dat I not drink your health ; but it no use -- dat why you see me drink ; I tell plenty time you make me mad -- you make me drink obeah water -- make me kill myself .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 13]: Now I ab done it -- I drink pison water just now .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 8]: In two hour I dead woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 24]: At this communication , the truth of which appeared confirmed by the woman 's behaviour , all the company started from their chairs .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 17]: `` Gemmen , I dare say you all very sorry ; you be more sorry by-and-by .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 36]: Captain , I beg your pardon ; Mr W -- , Mr G -LRB- the two planters -RRB- , I beg your pardon ; I not mean hurt you , but could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 38]: Now I tell all company , all drink the pison water -- because I not like die on the jibbit , I drink de pison water -- Gemmen your dinner all pison , and you all pisoned .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 24]: Yes , all pisoned , '' cried Mammy Crissobella at the highest pitch of her voice , and rushing out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 19]: At this announcement , I started from my chair and clasped my hands , as if in agony .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 25]: I looked round me -- never did I witness such a variety of horror as was expressed in the different faces at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 35]: The old planter ; Mr D , who sat next to me , and who was in the secret as well as Mr G , laid his head on the table with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 56]: `` The Lord have mercy on my sins , '' exclaimed Mr G ; Mr Lieutenant Maxwell looked me in the face , and then burst into tears ; Mr Lieutenant Dott put his fingers down his throat , and with three or four more getting rid of their dinner as fast as they could .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 14]: At last I sprang up to ring the bell ; no one answered .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 6]: I rang again more furiously .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 6]: At last a slave appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 7]: `` Where 's my servant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 7]: `` Not here , sar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 11]: `` Where 's all the people of the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 12]: `` All with missy , sar ; Mammy Crissobella die . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 21]: `` Run down then to the beach , and desire the surgeon of the brig to come up immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 14]: `` Yes , sar , '' replied the negro , leaving the room .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 27]: `` Oh , I feel it now -- here , '' exclaimed I , putting my hand to my chest ; `` I 'm suffocating . ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 15]: `` And so do I , '' replied one of the midshipmen , weeping .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 10]: The girl Leila now entered the room in tears .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 8]: `` Mammy dead , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 21]: `` Oh Captain Keene , I very sorry for you : you come with me , I give you something .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 7]: I know how stop pison . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 6]: `` Do you , Leila ?
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 10]: then give it me ; quick , quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes ; give it us quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 19]: `` I not stuff enough but I make more when I gib what I ab to Captain Keene .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 17]: You all stay still , not move ; pose you move about , make pison work .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: I come back soon as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 34]: Leila then took my arm and led me tottering out of the room , when I went to Mammy Crissobella , and laughed till I cried ; but the punishment was not over .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 61]: After remaining about ten minutes looking at each other , but neither speaking nor moving , in pursuance of Leila 's direction , with the utmost despair in their countenances , they were gladdened by the return of Leila with a large jug , out of which she administered a glass of some compound or another to each of them .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 93]: I watched at the door , and the eagerness with which they jostled and pushed each other to obtain the dose before the rest was very amusing , and never did they swallow any liquor with so much avidity , little imagining that , instead of taking what was to cure them , they were now taking what was to make them very sick ; but so it was ; and in a few minutes afterwards the scene of groaning , crying , screaming , writhing with pain , was quite awful .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 54]: After a time , the slaves came in and carried them all to their respective beds , leaving them to their own reflections , and the violent effects of the drugs administered , which left them no repose for that night , and in a state of utter exhaustion on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 21]: At daylight I went into Mr Dott 's room with the surgeon , to whom I had confided the secret .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 6]: Tommy was a miserable object .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 4]: `` Thank heaven !
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 13]: here is one still alive , '' said the surgeon to me .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 32]: Captain Keene , '' said Tommy , `` I 'm glad to see that you are so well ; but you had the remedy given you long before we had . ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 28]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` it was given me in good time ; but I hope it was not too late with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 10]: `` I feel very bad , '' replied Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 11]: `` Doctor , do you think I shall live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 32]: The doctor felt his pulse , and looked very grave ; at last he said , `` If you get over the next twelve hours , I think you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 7]: `` How many are dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 3]: inquired Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 22]: `` I do n't know ; you are the first that I have visited ; it 's a shocking business . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 28]: `` I 've been thinking that we were very wrong , '' said Tommy ; `` we ought not to have driven the poor woman to desperation .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 14]: If I do recover , her death will be on my conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 34]: `` I 'm glad to hear you say that , Tommy , '' replied I ; `` but the doctor says you must remain very quiet , and therefore I shall leave you .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: Good-bye ; I will see you again this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 25]: `` Good-bye , sir , and I hope you 'll forgive me for not having been so respectful as I should have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 17]: `` Yes , yes , Tommy ; we have been friends too long for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 17]: Mammy Crissobella 's dose had certainly put an end to all Tommy 's spirit of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 44]: All the others who had been victims to our plot were kept in the dark as to the real facts , and , as soon as they were able to be moved , paid their bills to Leila , and left the house .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 54]: On the third day , Tommy Dott and Mr Maxwell went on board , imagining that they had had a miraculous escape , and the two old planters and I were left the only inmates of the house to welcome the resurrection of Mammy Crissobella , who was again as busy as before .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 41]: She said to me , `` Massy Keene , I really under great obligation to you ; suppose you want two , three hundred , five hundred pounds , very much at your service ; never mind pay back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 17]: I replied that I did not want any money , and was equally obliged to her .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 10]: But the affair had already made a great noise .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 34]: It was at first really supposed that Mammy Crissobella had poisoned them as well as herself , and I was obliged to refute it , or the authorities would have taken it up .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 57]: As the admiral sent down to make inquiries , I went up to him and told him the whole story ; I was obliged to do the same to the governor , and it was the occasion of great mirth all over the island , and no small mortification to those who had been the sufferers .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 28]: Mammy Crissobella was complimented very much upon her successful stratagem to clear her house , and she was quite in ecstasies at the renown that she obtained .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 25]: One day the admiral sent for me , and said -- `` Keene , I can wait no longer the arrival of another vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 16]: I must send you to England with despatches : you must sail to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 44]: As I was all ready , I took my leave of the admiral , who promised me every assistance if on his station , and his good word with the Admiralty , and said that he would send down my despatches at daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 56]: I went on board , gave the necessary orders , and then returned to the hotel to pack up my portmanteau and pay my bill ; but Mammy Crissobella would not hear of my paying anything ; and as I found that she was beginning to be seriously angry , I gave up the point .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 33]: So I gave the old lady a kiss as a receipt-in-full , and another to Leila , as I slipped a couple of doubloons into her hand , and went on board .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 29]: The next morning shortly after daylight the despatches were on board , and the Diligente was under all the sail she could carry on her way to England .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 16]: The Diligente sailed as well as ever , and we made a very quick passage .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 19]: I found my ship 's company to be very good , and had no trouble with my officers .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 17]: Tommy Dott was very well behaved , notwithstanding all his threats of what he would do .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 14]: It was therefore to be presumed that he was not very ill treated .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 59]: We were now fast approaching the end of our passage , being about a hundred miles to the South West of the Scilly Islands , with a light wind from the southward when , in the middle watch , Bob Cross , who had the charge of it , came down and reported firing in the South East .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 22]: I went up , but , although we heard the report of the guns , we could not distinguish the flashes .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 20]: I altered our course to the direction , and we waited till daylight should reveal what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 19]: Before daybreak we could see the flashes , and make out one vessel , but not the other .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 11]: But when the sun rose the mystery was cleared off .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 16]: It was a French schooner privateer engaging a large English ship , apparently an East-Indiaman .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 15]: The ship was evidently a good deal cut up in her spars and rigging .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 64]: Bob Cross , who was close to my side when I examined them with my glass , said , `` Captain Keene , that rascally Frenchman will be off as soon as he sees us , if we hoist English colours ; but if you hoist French colours , we may get down and pin him before he knows what we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 17]: `` I think you are right , Bob , '' says I. `` Hoist French colours .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 18]: He will make sure of his prize then , and we shall laugh at his disappointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 31]: As Cross turned away to go aft , I perceived a chuckle on his part , which I did not understand , as there was nothing particular to chuckle about .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 27]: I thought it was on account of the Frenchman 's disappointment , when he found that we were not a friend , as he might suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 18]: `` Had n't we better fire a gun , Captain Keene , to attract their attention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` it will look as if we really were Frenchmen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 17]: The gun was fired , and we continued to stand towards them with a good breeze .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 31]: About seven o'clock we were within two miles , and then we observed the Englishman haul down her colours , and the schooner immediately went alongside , and took possession .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 16]: I continued to run down , and in half an hour was close to her .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 60]: Calling up the boarders , I laid the brig alongside the schooner ; as half her men were on board the Indiaman , they were taken by surprise , and we gained possession with very trifling loss on our side , much to the astonishment of the crew of the privateer , as well as that of the Indiaman .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 51]: The captain , who was on deck , informed me that they had engaged the schooner for nine hours , and that he had some hopes of beating her off , until he saw me come down under French colours , upon which he felt that further resistance was vain .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 26]: I told him I was afraid the schooner would escape , if I had not deceived him , and complimented him upon his vigorous defence .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 19]: The schooner was a very fine vessel , mounting fourteen guns , and of three hundred tons burthen .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 12]: In fact , she was quite as large as the Diligente .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 56]: While we were handing the prisoners over to the brig , and securing them , I accepted the invitation of the captain of the Indiaman to go into the cabin with him , where I found a large party of passengers , chiefly ladies , who were very loud in their thanks for my rescue .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 8]: In another hour we were all ready .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 29]: I left a party on board the Indiaman to repair damages , and my surgeon to assist the wounded men , and hauled off the brig and schooner .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 17]: The latter I gave into the charge of Tommy Dott , and we all made sail .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 43]: As I was walking the quarter-deck , delighted with my success , Cross , who had the watch and was by my side , said , `` I think , Captain Keene , you did very right in hoisting French colours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 31]: `` Why , yes , Cross , '' replied I ; `` she is a very fast sailer , that is evident , and she might have escaped us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 12]: `` That 's not what I mean , Captain Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 7]: `` What then , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 66]: `` Why , sir , I would not tell you why I wished you to hoist French colours at the time , because I was afraid that , if I did , you would not have done so ; but my reason was , that it would make a great difference in our prize-money , and I want some , if you do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 30]: Even then I could not imagine what Cross meant , for it never came into my head , and I turned round and looked at him for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 91]: `` Why , Captain Keene , if we had hoisted English colours , the schooner would have made sail and gone off , and , even if she had not done so , the Indiaman would have held out till we came down ; but as he hauled down his colours , and was taken possession of by the enemy , he now becomes a recapture , and I expect the salvage of that Indiaman will be of more value to us than two or three of such schooners . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 21]: `` That certainly did not enter my head when I hoisted the colours , Cross , I must confess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 18]: `` No , sir , that I saw it did not , but it did mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 9]: `` It 's hardly fair , Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 10]: `` Quite fair , sir , '' replied Bob .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 28]: `` The Company is rich , and can afford to pay , and we want it in the first place , and deserve it in the next .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 61]: At all events , it 's not upon your conscience , and that schooner is such a clipper , that I really think we should have lost her , if she had run for it ; besides , as she is as strong as we are , we might have lost a good many men before we took her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 26]: `` That 's very true , Bob , '' replied I , `` and satisfies me that I was right in what I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 61]: The wind had sprung up much fresher from the westward , and we were now all three running with a fair wind ; and as it continued , we did not put into Plymouth , but continued our course for Portsmouth , and on the third day , at a very early hour in the morning , anchored at Spithead .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 77]: As it was too soon to present myself to the admiral , I dressed , ready to go on shore , and hoisted the number of the Diligente as given by the admiral at Jamaica ; but , as I expected , it was not known to the guard-ship , and there was much surmise among the early risers as to what might be the large ship , schooner , and brig-of-war , which had entered .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 59]: We had just finished the washing of the decks , and I was standing aft with Cross , who had the morning watch , when he observed to me , `` Captain Keene , we are now at anchor as near as possible to where the Calliope was when you went adrift in the boat with poor Peggy .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 10]: Some difference between your situation now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 61]: `` Yes , Bob , '' replied I ; `` I was thinking the same when I was dressing this morning , and I was also thinking that you would be very anxious to go on shore -- so you may take a boat as soon as you please ; I will order one to be given to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 5]: `` Thankey , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 21]: I am a little anxious to see the poor girl , and I think matters will go smooth now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 10]: `` I hope so , with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 17]: Let the gigs be all dressed and cleaned , and the boat manned at six bells .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 11]: Pass the word for them to get their breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 48]: As it was better that I should wait for the admiral 's getting up , than that he should wait for me , I was on shore , and up at the office at half-past seven o'clock , and found that the admiral was in his dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 22]: The secretary was there , and I delivered my orders and despatches , with which he went up to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 28]: In about a quarter of an hour he came down again with the port-admiral 's request that I would wait for him , and stay to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 18]: The secretary remained with me , extracting all the West India intelligence that I could give him .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 17]: As soon as the admiral made his appearance , he shook me warmly by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 27]: `` Captain Keene , '' said he , `` I wish you joy : I see you are following up your career in the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 20]: We know you well enough by the despatches , and I am glad to be personally acquainted with you .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 28]: This last business will , I have no doubt , give you the next step , as soon as you have been a little longer as commander .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 19]: Mr Charles , desire them to make the signal for the Diligente and schooner to come into harbour .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: The Indiaman may , of course , do as he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 7]: Now then , for breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 39]: The admiral , of course , asked me as many questions as the secretary , and ended , as I rose to take my leave , in requesting the pleasure of my company to dinner on that day .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 17]: As the reader may suppose , I had every reason to be satisfied with my reception .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 35]: As soon as I had left the admiral 's office , I put into the post-office , with my own hands , my letter to my mother , and one to Lord de Versely .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 22]: In the latter I told him of my good fortune , and enclosed a copy of my despatch to the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 56]: Although the despatch was written modestly , still the circumstances in themselves -- my having recaptured an Indiaman , and carried , by boarding , a vessel of equal force to my own , and superior in men -- had a very good appearance , and I certainly obtained greater credit than it really deserved .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 66]: It was not at all necessary to say that I hoisted French colours , and therefore took the schooner unawares , or that at the time most of her men were on board of the Indiaman ; the great art in this world is , to know where to leave off , and in nothing more than when people take the pen in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 52]: As soon as I had finished my correspondence -- for I wrote a few lines to Mrs Bridgeman , at Chatham , and a postscript to my mother 's letter -- I went down to the saluting battery , when I found that the two vessels were just entering the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 33]: I went up and reported it at the admiral 's office , and the admiral went on board of both vessels to examine them himself , and he ordered a dock-yard survey .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 17]: They were both pronounced fit for his Majesty 's service , with the necessary dock-yard alterations .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 22]: The crew of the Diligente were turned over to a hulk , preparatory to unrigging and clearing her out for dock .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 35]: As soon as I left the admiral 's house , I sat down at the George Hotel , where I had taken up my quarters , and wrote a long letter to Minnie Vanderwelt .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 8]: Cross called upon me the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 14]: I saw by his countenance that he had good news to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 70]: He had found his lady-love as constant as he could wish , and having explained to the blind old smuggler that he had been offered and accepted the situation of boatswain in his Majesty 's service during the time that he was in the West Indies , he had received his approbation of his conduct , and a warm welcome to the house whenever he could come on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 30]: `` I have not put the question to the old chap yet , Captain Keene , '' said he , `` but I think I will very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 41]: `` Do n't be in too great a hurry , Bob , '' replied I. `` Give the old fellow a little more ` baccy , and ask his advice as to what you are to do with your prize-money .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 16]: You must also talk a little about your half-pay and your widow 's pension . ''
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 14]: `` That 's very good advice , Captain Keene , '' replied Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: `` Mercy on us !
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 5]: how things are changed !
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 51]: It appears but the other day that I was leading you down to this very hotel , to ship you into the service , and you was asking my advice , and I was giving it to you ; and now I am asking your advice , and taking it .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 29]: You have shot ahead in every way , sir , that 's sartain ; you looked up to me then , now I look up to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 31]: I laughed at Cross 's observation , which was too true ; and then we went into the dock-yard , and were very busy during the remainder of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 18]: The following morning I received an answer from Lord de Versely , couched in most friendly terms .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 54]: He complimented me on my success , and the high character I had gained for myself during so short a career , and added that he should be happy to see me as soon as I could come to London , and would himself introduce me to the first lord of the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 31]: He advised me to request leave of absence , which would be immediately granted , and concluded his letter , `` Your sincere friend and well-wisher , de Versely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 42]: As soon as I had laid down the letter , I said to myself , I was right -- the true way to create an interest in a man like Lord de Versely , is to make him proud of you .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 22]: I have done well as yet -- I will try to do more ; but how long will this success continue ?
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 6]: Must I not expect reverses ?
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: May not some reaction take place ?
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 10]: and have I not in some degree deserved it ?
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 15]: Yes , I have used deceit in persuading him of my mother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 23]: I began now to think that that was a false step , which , if ever discovered , might recoil upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 9]: I remained a long while in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 52]: I tried to extenuate my conduct in this particular , but I could not ; and to rid myself of melancholy feelings , which I could not overcome , I wrote a letter , requesting leave of absence for a fortnight , and took it myself to the admiral 's office .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 42]: This depression of spirits remained with me during the time that I remained at Portsmouth , when , having obtained leave , I set off for London , and on arrival , put up at a fashionable hotel in Albermarle Street .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 16]: The next morning I called at Lord de Versely 's and sent up my card .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 13]: I was immediately ushered up , and found myself in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 13]: Lord de Versely rose from his sofa , and took my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 11]: `` Keene , I am very glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 18]: I am proud that an _ eleve _ of mine should have done me so much credit .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 17]: You have gained all your rank in the service by your own merit and exertions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 35]: `` Not quite all , my lord , '' replied I. `` Yes , all ; for you are certain of your next step -- they can not well refuse it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 22]: `` They will not refuse your lordship , I have no doubt , '' replied I. `` Sit down , Keene .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 17]: We will have a little conversation , and then we will go to the Admiralty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 27]: His lordship then asked me many questions relative to what had passed ; and I entered into more detail than I had done in my letters .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 45]: After an hour 's conversation , carried on by him in so friendly -- I may almost say affectionate -- a style as to make my heart bound with delight , the carriage was announced , and accompanied his lordship down to the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 15]: His lordship sent up his card , and was requested immediately to go upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 59]: He desired me to follow him ; and as soon as we were in the presence of the first lord , and he and Lord de Versely had shaken hands , Lord de Versely said , `` Allow me to introduce to you Captain Keene , whose name , at least , you have often heard of lately .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 34]: I have brought him with me because he is a follower of mine : he entered the service under my protection , and continued with me until his conduct gave him his promotion .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 40]: I have taken this opportunity of introducing him , to assure your lordship that , during the whole time that he served with me as midshipman , his gallantry was quite as conspicuous as it has been since . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 16]: The first lord took me by the hand , and complimented me on my conduct .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 10]: `` Captain Keene has strong claims , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 9]: What can we do now for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 61]: `` I trust you will acknowledge that Captain Keene has earned his post rank , my lord , '' replied Lord de Versely ; `` and I shall take it as a particular favour to myself if your lordship would appoint him to a frigate , and give him an opportunity of doing credit to your lordship 's patronage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 36]: `` I think I may promise you both , '' replied the first lord ; `` but when we meet in the house to-night , I will let you know what I can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 18]: After a few minutes ' conversation , Lord de Versely rose , and we left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 38]: As soon as we were in the carriage his lordship said , `` Keene , you may depend upon it I shall have good news to tell you to-morrow ; so call upon me about two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 17]: I dine out to-day with the premier ; but to-morrow you must dine with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 39]: I took leave of his lordship as soon as the carriage stopped ; and as I wished to appoint an agent , which I had not yet done , I had begged his lordship to recommend me one .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 15]: He gave me the address of his own , and I went there accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 31]: Having made the necessary arrangements , I then employed the remainder of the day in fitting myself out in a somewhat more fashionable style than Portsmouth tailors were equal to .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 27]: The next morning I sat down to write to my mother ; but somehow or another I could not make up my mind to address her .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 57]: I had thought of it , over and over , and had made up my mind that in future I would always correspond with my grandmother ; and I now determined to write to her , explaining that such was my intention in future , and requesting that all answers should be also from my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 31]: I commenced my letter , however , with informing her that I had , since I had last written , obtained leave of absence , and was now in London .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 22]: I stated the kindness shown me in every way by Lord de Versely , and how grateful I was to him .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 34]: This continued down to the bottom of the first page , and then I said `` What would I not give to bear the name of one I so much love and respect !
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 9]: Oh , that I was a Delmar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 38]: I was just about to turn over the leaf and continue , when the waiter tapped at the door , and informed me that the tailor was come to try on the clothes which I had ordered .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 53]: I went into the bed-room , which opened into the sitting-room , and was busy with the foreman , who turned me round and round , marking alterations with a piece of chalk , when the waiter tapped at the bed-room door , and said Lord de Versely was in the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 29]: I took off the coat which was fitting as fast as I could , that I might not keep his lordship waiting , and put on my own .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 45]: Desiring the man to wait my return , I opened the door , and found his lordship on the sofa , and then for the first time , when I again saw it , recollected that I had left the letter on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 10]: The very sight of it took away my breath .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 9]: I coloured up as I approached his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 11]: I had quite forgotten that I had addressed my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 14]: I stammered out , `` This is an honour , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 25]: `` I came to wish you joy of your promotion and appointment to a fine frigate , Keene , '' said Lord de Versely .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 33]: `` I have just received this from the Admiralty ; and as I have business unexpectedly come to hand , I thought I would be the bearer myself of the good news .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 16]: I leave you the letter , and shall of course see you to dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 19]: `` Many thanks , my lord , '' replied I. `` I am , indeed , grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 13]: `` I believe you are , Keene , '' replied his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 20]: `` By the bye , you leave your letters so exposed , that one can not help seem them .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 9]: I see you are writing to your grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 9]: I hope the old lady is well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 3]: My grandmother !
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 25]: Oh , what a relief to my mind it was when I then recollected that it was to my grandmother that I had written !
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 14]: I replied that she was very well when I last heard from her .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 21]: `` If I can be of any use in arranging your money affairs , Keene , let me know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 40]: `` I thank you , my lord ; but I found that my agent perfectly understands business , '' replied I. `` I will not trouble your lordship , who has so many important affairs to attend to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 8]: `` Very good , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 23]: `` Then now I 'll leave you to read what I have given you ; and I shall expect you at eight .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 3]: Goodbye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 14]: His lordship again shook me warmly by the hand , and left me .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 12]: I was quite giddy with the reaction produced upon my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 13]: When his lordship left the room I dropped down on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 19]: I forgot the letter in my hand and its contents , and the tailor in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 33]: All I thought of was the danger I had escaped , and how fortunate I was in not having addressed the letter to my mother , as I had at first intended .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 36]: The agony which I felt was very great , and , as I remained with my hands covering my eyes , I made a vow that nothing should induce me ever to use deceit again .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 7]: I then read over the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 21]: There was nothing but gratitude to Lord de Versely , and a wish that I had been born a Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 50]: Well , if his lordship had run his eyes over it , there was nothing to hurt me in his opinion ; on the contrary , it proved that I was grateful ; and I then recollected that when I expressed my gratitude , he said he believed it .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 26]: As for my saying that I wished my name was Delmar , it was nothing , and it let him know what my wishes were .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 11]: On the whole , I had great cause for congratulation .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 17]: I was here interrupted by the tailor who put his head out of the bed-room door .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 34]: I went to him , and he finished his work , and promised me that I should have a complete suit at half-past seven o'clock in the evening , in time for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 21]: I then returned to the sitting-room , and opened the letter which Lord de Versely had put into my hands .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 47]: It was from the first lord , acquainting him that I might call at the Admiralty the next day , as my post-captain 's commission was signed , and I was appointed to a thirty-two gun frigate which would be launched in two or three months .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 27]: Well , then , thought I , here I am , at twenty-three , a post-captain in his Majesty 's service , and commanding a frigate .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 10]: Surely , I have much to be thankful for .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 17]: I felt that I had , and I was grateful to Heaven for my good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 26]: Now I had but one more wish in the world , and that was , instead of being Captain Keene , to be Captain Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 13]: The reader may say , `` What 's in a name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 39]: True ; but such was my ambition , my darling wish , and it is ardent longing for anything , the ardour of pursuit , which increases the value of the object so much above its real value .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 48]: The politician , who has been manoeuvring all his life does not perhaps feel more pleasure in grasping the coronet which he has been in pursuit of , than the urchin does when he first possesses himself of a nest which he has been watching for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 51]: This would , indeed , be a dreary world if we had not some excitement , some stimulus to lead us on , which occupies our thoughts , and gives us fresh courage , when disheartened by the knavery , and meanness , and selfishness of those who surround us .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 15]: How sad is the analysis of human nature -- what contradictions , what extremes !
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 41]: how many really brave men have I fallen in with , stooping to every meanness for patronage , court favour , or gain ; slandering those whose reputation they feared , and even descending to falsehood to obtain their ends !
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 12]: How many men with splendid talents , but with little souls !
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 91]: Up to the present I had run a career of prosperous success ; I had risen to a high position without interfering , or being interfered with by others ; but now I had become of sufficient consequence to be envied ; now I had soon to experience , that as you continue to advance in the world , so do you continue to increase the number of your enemies , to be exposed to the shafts of slander , to be foiled by treachery , cunning , and malevolence .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 6]: But I must not anticipate .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 38]: I remained in London till my leave was expired , and then went down to Portsmouth to pay off the brig , which had been ordered into dock , to be refitted for his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 43]: The Circe , thirty-two , to which I had been appointed , was a small but very beautiful frigate and as far as I could judge by her build as she lay on the stocks , had every requisite for sailing well .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 49]: When I took my leave of Lord de Versely , he told me that he should come down on the first of the following month -LRB- September -RRB- to Madeline Hall , where his aunt , Miss de Versely , was still flourishing at a green old age .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 44]: `` Here is a letter of introduction to her , Keene , '' said he , `` as she has not seen you since you were a few months old , and therefore it is not very likely that she would recognise you .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 43]: Take my advice , and make yourself as agreeable to the old lady as you can ; you will find Madeline Hall a very pleasant place , when you are tired of the dockyard and the smell of pitch and tar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 20]: I thanked his lordship , and we parted with much more cordiality shown by him than I had experienced .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 28]: I hardly need say , that the first person who came to congratulate me on my arrival at Portsmouth was my old friend an adviser Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 80]: `` Well , Captain Keene , '' said Bob , as I shook him warmly by the hand , `` I 'm delighted at your success , and I know you will not be sorry to hear that I am getting on as well as I could wish in my small way ; Jane and I are to be married in a few days , and I hope you will honour me by being present at the wedding . ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 25]: `` That I will , Bob , with pleasure , '' replied I ; `` let me hear all that has taken place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 13]: `` Why , sir , it 's told in a few words .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 75]: I took your advice , and brought the old gentleman presents , and I sat with him and heard all his old stories at least fifty times over , and laughed at his jokes as regularly the last time as the first ; and he told Jane and her mother that I was a very pleasant , sensible and amusing young man -- although he had all the talk , and I had none .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 56]: The fact is , sir , it was he who first brought up the subject of my splicing his niece ; that is to say , he hinted how he should like to see her well settled , and that if she married according to his wishes , he would leave her all he had .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 79]: `` Well , sir , it was the opinion of Jane and her mother , that , as he was a whimsical , changeable old chap , it would be right for her to refuse me at first ; and so she did , very much to the old man 's annoyance , who then set his mind upon it , and swore that if she did not marry me , he would not leave her a farthing .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 37]: After a few days of quarrelling , Jane gave in , and the old chap swears that we shall be married immediately , and that he will give us half his property down at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 21]: `` Strike the iron while it 's hot , Bob , '' replied I. `` Is the day fixed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 24]: `` Not exactly , sir ; but we are to be put up in church next Sunday , and it takes three Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 15]: I hope you wo n't part with me , sir , '' continued Bob .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 45]: `` The Diligente will be paid off on Tuesday , they say , and if you could get me appointed to the Circe -- '' `` Why , Cross , you are thinking of going to sea again , even before you are married .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 12]: I should advise you not to be in such a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 21]: You must not displease the old gentleman ; besides , you must not leave a young wife so soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 28]: `` That 's very true , Captain Keene , but I do n't think I should be comfortable if I knew you were afloat without me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 15]: `` I suppose you think that I can not take care of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 64]: `` Yes , I do , sir ; but still I know that I should fret ; and , sir , it will be four months at least before the Circe is ready for sea and I may just as well be appointed to her , and I can decide whether I do go to sea or not when the time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 34]: `` Well , Cross , I will certainly apply for you ; but , if you take my advice , you will give up the sea altogether , and live on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 10]: `` I have nothing to do , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 21]: `` Yes , you have ; you have to cherish your wife , and look after the old gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 24]: `` Well he is rather shakey , they say sir ; the old woman is often called out to him at nights . ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 22]: `` Well , Cross , I will do as you wish , and time will decide how you are to act .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 23]: I am going over to Southampton for a few days perhaps , and will take care to be back by the wedding .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 10]: By-the-bye , have you heard anything about prize-money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 29]: `` Yes , sir ; it 's payable for the Diligente and schooner , and all our recaptures in the West Indies when we were in the Firefly .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 27]: The Dutch frigate has been for distribution some time ; but as I was only petty officer then , it wo n't come to much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 37]: `` Well , I can tell you that the government have taken the schooner which we captured in the chops of the channel , and the East India Company have given us salvage for the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 22]: My agent has received already 7,400 pounds on my account , which I have ordered to be purchased into the funds .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 21]: As there were so few warrant officers , your share will not be less than 1,500 pounds , perhaps more .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 26]: As you said , the salvage of the Indiaman has proved more valuable to us than all the rest of our prize-money put together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 32]: `` Well , Captain Keene , if my prize-money comes to as much as that , I think I shall be nearly as well off as my little Jane will be .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 25]: Will you have the kindness to let your agent put it by for me in the same way that you have done yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 25]: `` Yes , Cross , I will see to it immediately ; I shall write to him to-morrow , or the day after . ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 9]: After a little conversation , Cross took leave .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 69]: The next day I took post-horses , and went over to Madeline Hall , having two or three days before received a note from the Honourable Miss Delmar , saying how glad she should be to see me as a friend and shipmate of her nephew , Lord de Versely ; so that it appeared the old lady had been written to by Lord de Versely respecting me .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 23]: I arrived early in the afternoon , and the post-chaise drove up the avenue of magnificent chestnut-trees which led to the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 74]: I must say that I was very much excited ; I was now arriving at the site of my birth , and it brought to my mind the details given me by my poor mother , when , finding she could no longer conceal the truth from me , she entered into a narrative to extenuate her conduct , pointing out her temptations , and how fatal to her were opportunity and seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 46]: Her form was before me with the tears running down her cheeks as she made her humiliating confession to her own son , and I could not help exclaiming , as I cast my eye upon the beautiful grounds , `` My poor mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 13]: The chaise stopped , and the boys dismounted and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 29]: In a minute three or four servants made their appearance , and on inquiring , I found that the Honourable Miss Delmar was at home , and visible .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 10]: `` Colonel Delmar , I presume , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 5]: said the old butler .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 12]: `` No , '' replied I -- `` Captain Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 26]: The butler looked me full in the face , and earnestly ; and then , as if recollecting himself , he bowed and went on .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 52]: `` Captain Keene , madam , '' said he , as he introduced me into a large room , at the end of which sat a venerable-looking old lady , very busy with her knitting needle , and another , almost equally ancient , sitting on a low stool beside her .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 27]: As I advanced , the old lady made me a bow as she remained in in her chair , and looked at me through her spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 9]: She certainly was the beau-ideal of old age .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 63]: Her hair , which was like silver , was parted in braid , and was to be seen just peeping from under her cap and pinners ; she was dressed in black silk , with a snow-white apron and handkerchief , and there was an air of dignity and refinement about her which made you feel reverence for her at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 68]: As I approached to take the chair offered to me , the other person , who appeared to be a sort of attendant , was shuffling her feet to rise ; but as soon as Mrs Delmar had said , `` You are welcome , Captain Keene ; sit still , '' she continued , `` my child , there is no occasion to go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 54]: I could scarcely help smiling at the old lady calling a woman of past sixty , if not even further advanced , a child ; but the fact was , that Phillis had been her attendant as lady 's maid for many years , and subsequently promoted to the position of humble companion .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 125]: As for Miss Delmar , as I afterwards found out from her own lips , she was upwards of eighty-seven years old , but still in perfect good health , and in full possession of all her faculties ; Phillis therefore was much younger , and as the old lady had had her in her employ ever since she was twenty-two , it was not surprising that she continued to address her , as she had done for so many years , as a young person compared to herself ; indeed I have no doubt but that the old lady , following up her association of former days , and forgetting the half-century that had intervened , did consider her as a mere child .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 42]: The old lady was very chatty and very polite , and as our conversation naturally turned on Lord de Versely , of whom I spoke in terms of admiration and gratitude , I had soon established myself in her good graces .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 17]: Indeed , as I subsequently discovered , her nephew was the great object of her affections .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 33]: His younger brother had neglected her , and was never mentioned except when she regretted that Lord de Versely had no children , and that the title would descend to his brother .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 31]: She requested me to stay for dinner , which I did not refuse , and before dinner was over I had made great progress in the old lady 's esteem .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 16]: As , when dinner was announced , her companion disappeared , we were then alone .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 37]: She asked me many questions relative to Lord de Versely , and what had occurred during the time that I was serving with him ; and this was a subject on which I could be eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 39]: I narrated several of our adventures , particularly the action with the Dutch frigate , and other particulars in which I could honestly do credit to his lordship , and I often referred to his kindness for me .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 51]: `` Well , Captain Keene , my nephew has often spoken to me about you , and now you have done him credit in proving that he had made you a good officer ; and I have heard how much you have distinguished yourself since you have left him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 25]: `` Or rather he left me , madam , '' replied I , `` when he was summoned to the House of Peers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 10]: `` Very true , '' replied the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 17]: `` I suppose you know that you were born in this house , Captain Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 10]: `` I have been told so , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 18]: `` Yes , I have no doubt your poor mother that 's gone must have told you .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 43]: I recollect her -- a very clever , active , and pretty young woman -LRB- here the old lady sighed -RRB- ; and I held you in my arms , Captain Keene , when you were only a few days old . ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 13]: `` You did me great honour , madam , '' replied I .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 14]: Here the conversation took another channel , which I was not sorry for .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 50]: After tea , I rose to take my leave , and then I received an invitation from the old lady to come and spend some time at Madeline Hall , and to come a few days before the first of September , that I might join the shooting party .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 40]: `` I expect my nephew , Lord de Versely , '' said she , `` and there is Colonel Delmar of the Rifles , a cousin of Lord de Versely , also coming , and one or two others .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 8]: Indeed I expect the colonel every day .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 10]: He is a very pleasant and gentleman-like man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 13]: I accepted the invitation with pleasure , and then took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 120]: The chaise drove off , and I was soon in a deep reverie ; I called to mind all my mother had told me , and I longed to return to the Hall , and visit those scenes which had been referred to in my mother 's narrative ; and more than that , I wished to meet Lord de Versely on the spot which could not fail to call to his mind my mother , then young , fond , and confiding ; how much she had sacrificed for him ; how true she had proved to his interests , and how sacred the debt of obligation , which he could only repay by his conduct towards me .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 25]: On my return to Portsmouth , I found that orders had come down for the paying off the Diligente , and re-commissioning her immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 42]: As the men would now be free -LRB- until again caught by the impress , which would not be long -RRB- , I turned up the ship 's company , and asked how many of them would enter for the Circe .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 71]: I pointed out to them that they would be impressed for other vessels before long , but that I could give them each three months of absence , upon which they would not be molested , and that by three months all their money would be gone , and if it were gone before that time , the guard-ship would receive them when they had had enough of the shore .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 18]: By this method I proposed to myself to obtain the foundation of a good ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 5]: I was not disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 38]: Every man I wished to take with me volunteered , and I wrote leave of absence tickets for three months for them all as belonging to the Circe , reporting what I had done to the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 25]: The brig was then paid off , and the next day re-commissioned by a Captain Rose , with whom I had some slight acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 75]: As I was now my own master again , -- for although appointed to the Circe , I had nothing but my pennant to look at , -- I thought that , by way of a little change , I would pass a few days at the Isle of Wight ; for this was the yachting season , and I had made the acquaintance of many of the gentlemen who belonged to the club .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 14]: That I had no difficulty in getting into society may easily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 107]: A post-captain 's commission in his Majesty 's navy is a certain passport with all liberal and really aristocratical people ; and , as it is well known that a person who has not had the advantage of interest and family connections to advance in the service , must have gained his promotion by his own merits , his rank is sufficient to establish his claims to family connections or personal merit , either of which is almost universally acknowledged ; I say almost universally , because , strange to say , for a succession of reigns , the navy never has been popular at court .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 24]: In that region , where merit of any kind is seldom permitted to intrude , the navy have generally been at a discount .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 37]: Each succession of the House of Hanover has been hailed by its members with fresh hopes of a change in their favour , which hopes have ended in disappointment ; but perhaps it is as well .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 59]: The navy require no prophet to tell it , in the literal sense of the word , that one can not touch pitch without being defiled ; but there is a moral pitch , the meanness , the dishonesty , and servility of Court , with which , I trust , our noble service will never be contaminated .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 59]: I have , however , somewhat wandered from my subject , which was brought up in consequence of a gentleman who had paid me every attention at a large club down at Cowes , to which I had been invited , inquiring of me , across the table , if I were connected with the Keenes of -- ?
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 26]: My reply was ready : `` I did not think that I was ; my father had died a young man in the East Indies .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 70]: I knew that he was of Scotch descent -LRB- which he was -RRB- , but I was too young to know anything about his connections , whom he had quitted at an early age ; since that I had been educated and brought forward by Lord de Versely , who had , since the death of my mother , treated me as if I were his own son . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 18]: This was said openly , and being strictly true , of course without hesitation on my part .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 31]: It was quite sufficient ; I had noble patronage , and it was therefore to be presumed that I was somebody , or that patronage would not have been extended .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 32]: I mention this , because it was the only time that I was ever questioned about my family ; it was therefore to be presumed that my reply was considered satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 34]: I accepted an invitation on board of the yacht and sailed about for several days , very much amused and flattered by the attention shown to me by the noble commodore and others .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: One day I fell in with an old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 80]: A small vessel , of about twenty tons , cutter-rigged , came down under the stern of the commodore 's yacht ; it was then very smooth water , very light wind , and , moreover , very hot weather ; and one of the squadron , who was standing by me on the taffrail , said , `` Keene , do look at this craft coming down under our stern -- there 's quite a curiosity in it .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 60]: It is a yacht belonging to an Irish Major O'Flinn , as he calls himself ; why the O , I do n't know ; but he 's a good fellow , and very amusing ; there he is abaft ; he has the largest whiskers you ever saw ; but it is not of him I would speak .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 23]: Wait a little , and as soon as the square sail is out of the way , you will see his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 4]: Such a whapper !
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 16]: I believe she weighs more than the rhinoceros did which was at Post-down fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 43]: As the vessel neared , I did behold a most enormous woman in a sky-blue silk dress , and a large sky-blue parasol over her head ; the bonnet having been taken off , I presume , on account of the heat .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 28]: `` She is a monster , '' replied I ; `` the major was a bold man ; I think I have seen the face before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 25]: `` I am told that she was the daughter of a purser , and had a lot of money , '' continued my friend .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 21]: I recollected then , and I replied , `` Yes ; I know now , her name was Culpepper . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 16]: `` That was the name , '' replied he ; `` I recollect now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 54]: The reader may probably recollect Miss Medea , who knew so well how to put that and that together ; and her mother , who I presumed had long ago been suffocated in her own fat , a fate which I thought that Mrs O'Flinn would meet with as well as her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 14]: The lady did not recognise me , which I was not sorry for .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 8]: I certainly should have cut her dead .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 31]: I walked forward , and my thoughts reverted to the time when my mother first brought me down to embark , and I was taken care of by Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 35]: This recollection of Bob Cross reminded me that I had promised to be at his wedding , and that it was to take place on the following day , which I had quite forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 35]: So that Mrs O'Flinn did me a good turn at last , as I should have neglected my promise , if she had not made her appearance , sailing along like an elephantine Cleopatra .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 35]: I had not called upon old Waghorn , the uncle of Jane ; as I was fearful that he might recognise the pretended agent of former days with the now captain of the Circe .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 32]: The blind are very acute in all their other senses , -- a species of reparation made by nature by way of indemnification for the severe loss which they have sustained .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 43]: As I grew older I grew wiser , and I could not help remarking , that the acts of deceit , which as a midshipman I thought not only very justifiable , but good fun , were invariably attended with unpleasant results .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 58]: Even in this trifle my heart misgave me , whether on my appearance at the wedding I might not I be recognised , and be the cause of creating a breach , by raising suspicions on the part of the blind man which might prevent the wedding ; and I had stated my fears to Bob Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 25]: `` Well , Captain Keene , it was all done with good intentions , and I do not think that there is much fear .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 21]: It 's a long while back , and you were not so much of a man as you are now .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 21]: They do say , that cheating never thrives , and I believe that it seldom does in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 12]: Jane will be much disappointed if you do not come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 28]: `` There is no help for it , Bob ; I must disguise my voice ; I must cheat a little now to hide the first cheat .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 10]: That 's always the case in this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 48]: `` I do n't call it cheating , sir ; my ideas are , that if you cheat to get advantage for yourself , then you do cheat ; but when you do so to help another , there 's no great cheating in the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 19]: `` I can not agree with you , Bob ; but let us say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 22]: I will be with you at ten o'clock , which you say is the hour that you go to church . ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 11]: This conversation took place on the morning of the wedding .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 58]: About eight o'clock , I dressed and breakfasted , and then took a wherry over to Gosport , and in half an hour was at the house , which was full of people with white favours , and in such a bustle , that it reminded me of a hive of bees just previous to a swarm .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 30]: `` Here 's the captain come , sir , '' said Bob , who had received me ; for the bride was still in her room with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 24]: `` Happy to see you , sir ; I wish you joy , Mr Waghorn , '' replied I , taking his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 24]: `` You 're Captain Keene , then , whose letters to the Admiralty Jane has so often read to me in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 5]: Where have we met ?
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 8]: I 've heard that voice before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 11]: `` Indeed sir , '' replied I , rather confused .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 57]: `` Yes , I have ; I always know a voice again ; let me see -- why , captain , you were here with Cross , the first time I ever heard him -- you were an agent , and now you 're a captain , '' continued the old man , looking very grave .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 17]: `` Hush , sir , '' replied I : `` pray do n't speak so loud .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 8]: Do you recollect what I came about ?
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 38]: Do you suppose that when I was a party to the escape of a prisoner I could let you know , being a perfect stranger , that I was an officer in his Majesty 's service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 19]: `` Very true , '' replied the old man , `` I can not blame you for that .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 13]: But was Cross an officer in the service at that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 30]: `` No , sir , he was not , '' replied I ; `` he was appointed boatswain to my ship by the admiral in the West Indies . ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 24]: I thought Cross might have deceived me also ; every one tries to cheat a blind man -- and the blind are suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 59]: I 'm glad that Cross did not deceive me , or I would have seen my niece in her coffin before -- but say no more about it , you could not do otherwise ; all 's right , sir , and I 'm very glad to see you , and to have the honour of your company .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 8]: Sit down , sir , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 16]: By the bye , Captain Keene , have you heard of the girl since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 52]: `` My dear sir , '' replied I , glad to give him my confidence , `` there are no secrets between us now ; it was no girl , but the son of the captain of the Dutch frigate , and an officer , whose escape you assisted in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 21]: `` I do n't wonder , then , at your not making yourself known , '' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 57]: `` Why , if I had known it had been an officer , I never would have had a hand in the job -- but a poor girl , it was mere charity to assist her , and I thought I was acting the part of a Christian , poor blind sinner that I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 16]: `` You did a kind act , sir , and Heaven will reward you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 15]: `` We are sad , wicked creatures , Captain Keene , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 49]: `` I wish this day was over , and my poor Jane made happy ; and then I should have nothing to do but to read my Bible , and prepare for being called away ; it 's never too soon , depend upon it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 22]: The appearance of the bride with her bridesmaids put an end to our conversation , which I was not sorry for .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 26]: The order of march was arranged , and we started off for the church on foot , making a very long and very gay procession .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 13]: In half an hour it was all over , and we returned .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 17]: I then had an opportunity of telling Cross what had passed between me and old Waghorn .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 45]: `` It was touch and go , sir , that 's sartin , '' replied Bob ; `` for if the old gentleman had not been satisfied , he is so obstinate that the match would have been broken off at the church door .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 45]: Well , sir , I always said that you were the best to get out of a scrape that I ever knew when you were a middy , and you do n't appear to have lost the talent ; it was well managed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 26]: `` Perhaps so , Bob ; but in future I do not intend to get into them , which will be managing better still . ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 18]: I then left Cross , and went to talk to Jane , who certainly looked very handsome .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 20]: The tables for dinner were laid out in the garden , for it was a beautiful warm autumnal day .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 15]: We sat down about twenty , and a merrier party I never was at .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 38]: Old Waghorn was the only one who got tipsy on the occasion , and it was very ridiculous to hear him quoting scraps of Scripture in extenuation , and then calling himself a poor blind old sinner .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 28]: It was not till eight o'clock in the evening that the party broke up , and I had then some difficulty to persuade some to go away .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 16]: As for the old man , he had been put to bed an hour before .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 28]: I staid a few minutes after all were gone , and then , kissing Jane , and shaking hands with Bob , I went back to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 98]: As soon as I was at home again , the events of the day , from association of ideas , naturally brought Minnie Vanderwelt into my head , and I recollected that I had not written to her since my promotion and appointment to the Circe ; I therefore sat down and indited a long letter , ending with expressing my regret at not having received an answer from the many I had written , especially the last , which informed them of my arrival in England , and gave them the knowledge where to address me .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 18]: I also requested to know what had become of young Vangilt , whose escape I had contrived .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 49]: Having enclosed that letter to the agent , and begged him to have it forwarded to Hamburg , I went to bed , and , after the excitement of the day , had a variety of dreams , in which Minnie 's form was continually making its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 59]: The following morning brought me a long letter from my aunt , Mrs Bridgeman , very lively and very amusing : the only news in it was the marriage of Lieutenant Flat to a tavern-keeper 's daughter , which had given great offence to the marine corps , as she was said to be rather light of carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 25]: She begged me very much to pay them a visit , but that was not all to my wishes , I most candidly confess .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 42]: My pride revolted at it ; I even doubt if I would have fitted out a ship at Chatham where people could point their finger at me , and say -- That post-captain 's father was a marine in those barracks .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 44]: Another letter from Lord de Versely , announcing his arrival at Madeline Hall , and requesting me to join him as soon as possible , was infinitely more to my taste , and I resolved to start next day , which I did .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 30]: I was very cordially received by his lordship , and very graciously by the old lady , who expressed a hope that I would now make a long visit .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 64]: About an hour after I had arrived , Colonel Delmar made his appearance : he was a cousin of Lord de Versely 's , but I certainly should not , from his appearance , have supposed him to be a Delmar : for he was short , round-shouldered , and with a fat , rubicund face , apparently about forty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 47]: I observed , after our introduction , that his eyes were very often directed towards me ; but his manner was courteous , and , although his appearance at first sight was not prepossessing , his conversation was very agreeable , and he was very gentleman-like .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 13]: Before dinner was over , I felt a great liking for him .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 46]: As the first of September had not yet arrived , the birds had still two days of peace and quietness , leading their broods through the stubbles , and pointing out to them the corn which had spilled on the ground , for their food .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 66]: That the old birds had some idea of a gun , it is to be supposed , from their having escaped the season before ; but the young coveys had still that pleasure to come ; in two days more they were to be initiated into the astonishing fact , that fast as feathers could fly , lead could fly faster , and overtake them .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 64]: The two or three days before the shooting season begins are invariably very tedious in the country , and I passed my morning chiefly in roaming through the park and pleasure grounds , and I hardly need say that , during those rambles , my thoughts were chiefly occupied with the intimacy which had taken place between my mother and Lord de Versely .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 45]: On the third morning after my arrival I had been strolling for more than two hours , when I came to a very retired sort of Gothic cell , formed of the distended limbs of an old oak , intermixed with stones and grass .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 22]: It faced towards the park , and was built up on the green lawn amidst clumps of laurel and other evergreens .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 7]: I threw myself on the benches .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 44]: It was just the place for a man to select for a rendezvous : just the secret spot where a maiden could listen without trembling at intruders ; and it struck me that this must have been the trysting place of my parents .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 45]: For an hour I remained there , castle-building for the future , and musing on the past , when I heard a voice , close to me on the other side of the cell , the back of which was turned towards the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 65]: I knew the voice to be that of the old lady , who , it appears , had , as usual , come out in her garden chair , and was dragged by her attendant , Phillis : the wheels had made no noise on the velvet lawn , and , until roused by her voice , I was not aware of their approach .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 18]: `` Nonsense , Phillis ; why , child , what should you know about such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 5]: said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 51]: `` If you please to recollect , ma'am , '' replied Phillis , who certainly was old enough to recollect all the passages in a woman 's life , `` I was your maid at the time that it happened , and I was constantly in company with Bella Mason .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 62]: She was very respectful towards you , but you did not know what her temper was ; there never was so proud a young woman , or who considered herself of such consequence as she did -- so much so , that she treated even Mr Jonas , the butler , and Mrs Short , the housekeeper , with disdain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 20]: `` Well , well , I know that she was proud ; her mother was always a proud woman .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 36]: Mr Mason , in his younger days , held property of his own , at least his father did , but he ran through it revelling and horse-racing ; but what does that prove ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 53]: `` I only say , madam , what was said at the time by everybody , that Bella Mason never would have married that marine , whom she looked upon with contempt , although he certainly was a good-looking young man , if she had not been obliged to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 8]: `` But why obliged , Phillis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 24]: `` To conceal her shame , madam ; for , if you recollect , the child was born three months after marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 56]: `` I recollect that , very well , '' replied Miss Delmar ; `` it was a sad thing , and , as my nephew said , I ought to have looked out sharper after Bella than I did , and not have allowed her to be so much in company with that marine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 6]: `` That marine , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 17]: he was innocent enough ; Bella was not likely to listen to one like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 10]: `` Who can you mean then , Phillis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 13]: `` Why , Lord de Versely , ma'am , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 25]: Everybody in the Hall was sure the child was his ; he and Bella were for ever together for months before her marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 61]: `` Phillis , Phillis , you do n't know what you are saying -- it 's impossible ; indeed , I recollect talking the matter over with Lord de Versely , who was then Captain Delmar , and he was more shocked at the impropriety than even I was , and offered to give the marine a good whipping . ''
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 39]: `` That may be , madam , but still Captain Delmar was the father of that boy ; for , if you recollect , old Mrs Mason came to the Hall , and went away almost immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 7]: `` Well , what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 7]: she was displeased no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 43]: `` Yes , indeed she was , madam ; but she had a private meeting with Captain Delmar ; and Mrs Short , the housekeeper , overheard what passed , and I understand that the captain did not deny it to her .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 34]: One thing is certain , that Mrs Mason , as she was going away , in her rage made use of language about Captain Delmar , which otherwise she never would have dared .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 25]: And , then , madam , only look at Captain Keene , -- why , he is the very image of his lordship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 17]: `` He is very like him , certainly , '' said the old lady , musing .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 37]: `` And then , madam , do you think his lordship would have brought the boy up in the service , and made him a post-captain , if he had been the son of a marine ?
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 44]: And then , madam , see how fond his lordship is of him ; why , he dotes upon him ; and would he ask the son of his own servant to come down to Madeline Hall , as fit company for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 76]: No ; so , madam , depend upon it , Captain Keene is a Delmar , and no wonder his lordship is so fond of him , madam ; for he is his only child , and I dare say his lordship would give him his right hand if he could leave him the barony and estates , instead of them going away , as they will , to his younger brother 's children . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 12]: `` Well , well , Phillis , it may be so .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 10]: I do n't know what to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 24]: I shall speak to Lord de Versely about it ; for if Captain Keene is a Delmar , he must be looked to .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 11]: He is a Delmar , although with the bar sinister .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 24]: I feel a little cold , Phillis , so drag me to the terrace , that I may get a little sunshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 17]: Phillis , I thank thee , said I to myself , as the chair wheeled away .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 10]: Your love of chatting may be useful to me .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 19]: Perhaps his lordship may now acknowledge my birth to his aunt , and good may come of it .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 41]: I waited till the chair wheels were heard on the gravel walk , and then quitted the grotto , and bent my steps away from the Hall , that I might commune with my own thoughts without chance of interruption .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 66]: I had quitted the park , and was now pacing over several fields , one after another , walking as if I had some important business in hand , when in fact , my legs were only trying to keep pace with my thoughts , when I vaulted over a gate , and found myself in a narrow lane , sunk deep between two hedges .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 36]: Indifferent as to the path I took , I turned to the right , and continued on my way , walking as fast as before , when I heard the low bellowing of an animal .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 28]: This induced me to raise my eyes , and I witnessed a curious scene in front of me , which I will narrate in the next chapter .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 46]: As I said before , the lane was very narrow , not admitting more than one vehicle to go along it , and was sunk between the hedges on each side , so as to render it not very easy to climb up the bank .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 46]: The parties who presented themselves were , first a cow with her tail turned towards me , evidently a wicked one , as she was pawing and bellowing in a low tone , and advancing towards two people who were the object of her attack .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 87]: One was a very little man , dressed in black , the other a stout burly young fellow in a shooting-jacket ; but what amused me most was , that the stout young fellow , instead of being in the advance to defend one so much smaller than himself , not only kept behind the little man , but actually now and then held him by the shoulders before his own person , as a shield to ward off the expected attack of the vicious animal .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 44]: It is true that the little personage expostulated , and spoke several times in a tone of command to his companion , but his words were unheeded , and the cow advanced , and they retreated in the order which I have described .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 24]: I quickened my pace , so as to gain rapidly upon them , and was soon but a few yards from the animal .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 31]: I had no stick or weapon of any kind , but still I knew how to manage unruly cattle as sailors do when they were sent on board ship alive .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 38]: Indeed I had more than once put it into practice myself ; and although with a bull it was not a very easy matter , with a cow I felt certain that I could effect my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 45]: The animal appeared now determined to come to close quarters ; and I therefore approached her until I was about a couple of feet from her flank , all ready for a spring , in case she should see me , and turn round .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 21]: But she was too busy with the parties in front of her , and at last she made a run .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 18]: The stout young man pushed the little man towards the cow , and then ran for it .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 22]: The little one , in his attempt to recoil , fell on the turf , and the cow made at him .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 81]: I sprang forward , and catching the horn of the animal farthest from me in my right hand , at the same time put my left knee on the horn nearest to me , threw all my weight upon it , so as to turn the animal 's nose up in the air , and seizing it by the nostrils with the other hand , I held her head in that position , which of course rendered the animal harmless .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 29]: In that position the cow went over the prostrate man without doing him any injury , plunging and capering , so as to extricate herself from my weight .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 28]: I remained clinging to her for about ten yards further , when I perceived the stout fellow ahead , who hallooed out , `` Hold her tight !
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 5]: hold her tight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 63]: but that I would no longer do , as it was fatiguing work ; so , as a punishment for his cowardice , I let go the animal , springing clear off , and behind it , the cow galloping away as fast as she could down the lane , and the fellow screaming and running before as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 39]: Having thus rid myself of the cow and the coward , I turned back to where the other party had been left on the ground , and found him standing up , and looking at what was passing .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 9]: `` You 're not hurt , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 34]: said I. `` No , thanks to you ; but no thanks to that rascally clerk of mine , who wanted to shove me on the cow 's horns to save himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 56]: `` He has a run for it now , at all events ; '' replied I , laughing , `` and I let the cow loose on purpose ; for if I had held on , and used all my strength , I could have brought her down on her side and kept her down .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 73]: there 's a break in the bank , and he has climbed up it , so he is safe for a good fright , '' continued I ; `` and now we had better get away ourselves ; for the animal may come back , and , although one can pin her in that way from behind , it is not to be done when she comes stem on to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 35]: `` Well , sir , I have heard of taking the bull by the horns as not being a very wise thing ; but taking a cow by them has probably saved my life .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 5]: I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 16]: `` We manage them that way on board ship , '' replied I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 16]: `` You are a sailor , then , sir , '' replied the little man .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 12]: `` Probably I have the pleasure of addressing Captain Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 30]: `` That is my name , '' replied I ; `` but here is the cow coming back , and the sooner we get to the gate the better .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 18]: I 'm not ashamed to run for it , and I suppose you are not either . ''
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 29]: So saying , I took to my heels , followed by my new companion , and we very soon put the barred gate between us and our enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 24]: `` I will wish you good day now , sir , '' said I ; `` I am going to the Hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 26]: `` I am also bound there , Captain Keene , '' replied my companion , `` and , with your permission , will accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 24]: Egad , we may meet another cow , '' said he , laughing , `` and I prefer being in your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 34]: He then informed me that he was the solicitor and agent of the Honourable Miss Delmar , and had been sent for about some new leases , and that his name was Warden .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 20]: During our walk I found him a very cheerful , merry little man , and a very good companion .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 42]: On our arrival at the Hall , Mr Warden was informed that Miss Delmar was not able to receive him just then , as she was very busy with Lord de Versely , who was with her in her private room .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 21]: I therefore remained with Mr Warden for about an hour , when Lord de Versely came down and joined us .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 22]: He appeared to be in a remarkable gay humour , and shook me warmly by the hand when he came in .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 28]: `` Now , Mr Warden , you are to go up and receive your instructions , and recollect , the sooner everything is executed the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 18]: Mr Warden left the room , and I narrated to his lordship the adventure with the cow .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 18]: Just as I had begun it , Colonel Delmar came in , and listened to my narration .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 17]: In about half an hour Mr Warden came down-stairs , and with a very smiling face .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 18]: `` Well , Mr Warden , '' said his lordship , `` have you your instructions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 20]: `` Yes , my lord and I assure you that I never shall execute any with so much pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 14]: Has Captain Keene told you how he saved my life this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 35]: `` No , he did not say that , '' replied his lordship ; `` but he has told me about the cow , and your clerk putting you foremost in the breach . ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 49]: `` She would have made a breach in me I expect , if it had not been for the captain , '' replied Mr Warden ; `` and you may therefore believe me , my lord , when I say that I shall obey my instructions with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 6]: I wish you good morning .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 6]: Good morning , Captain Keene .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 7]: Colonel , your most obedient . ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 9]: So saying , Mr Warden left the room .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 55]: I was very much struck with Mr Warden 's observation , that he would execute his instructions with so much pleasure ; and when I turned round , I perceived that Colonel Delmar was looking very grave ; but the first dinner bell rang , and we all went to our rooms to dress .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 27]: Well , thought I , as I was dressing myself , I presume the old lady has left me a thousand or two in her will .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 88]: I cared little about that , and then I dismissed the subject from my thoughts ; but as I sat by Miss Delmar after dinner , I could not help thinking that her manner towards me was more affectionate than it had been before ; the _ hauteur _ with which her civility and kindness had hitherto been blended appeared to have been thrown aside ; I presumed that Lord de Versely had been speaking in my favour , and felt grateful to him for his kindness .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 36]: Perhaps , thought I , he has revealed to her the secret of my birth , and she now considers me as a relation ; perhaps she may have left me more than I supposed .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 8]: However , it is of little consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 37]: The next day , being the first of September , we were all very busy , and we continued to shoot every day for a week , when I thought it time to return to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 24]: I mentioned my intentions to Lord de Versely , and was pressed to stay until the following Saturday , it being then Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 20]: On Wednesday Mr Warden made his appearance , attended by his clerk , who carried a bag of papers .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 32]: He remained half an hour and then went home ; but , before he went , he asked me to dine with him on the following day , and I consented .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 34]: After we returned from shooting the next day , I changed my clothes , and , leaving word with the butler that I dined out , I took my way across the fields .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 66]: I was walking very quietly on the grass , by the side of a high hedge , when I perceived two other men on the opposite side ; one I recognised as Colonel Delmar ; the other I could not at first make out ; but , as I approached them , I perceived that the colonel was talking with the clerk of Mr Warden .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 15]: I passed them without notice , for they were very earnestly engaged in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 58]: What they said , I did not know ; but I thought it singular that so proud a person as Colonel Delmar should be so engaged with an inferior ; a little reflection , however made me consider that there was nothing very surprising in Colonel Delmar 's entering into conversation with a man in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 14]: They might be talking about the game , or a hundred other things .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 34]: I had a very friendly dinner with Mr Warden , who , after dinner , gave me a hint that I should not be the worse for the papers signed the day before .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 19]: He did not however , say anything positive , as it would have been a breach of trust .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 47]: When I spoke of my soon being afloat again , he said that he would not fail to watch over my interests at the Hall during my absence , and he requested that I would write to him , and consider him as my sincere friend .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 56]: `` Of course , my dear Captain Keene , I do not expect that you will at present give me your entire confidence ; but I trust you will when you know me , and at all events that you will not fail to do so when my advice may be of use to you .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 27]: I have a debt of obligation to pay , and I shall be most happy to do so , if it is in my power ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 23]: I thanked Mr Warden for his kind offers , and promised to avail myself of them , and we parted great friends .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 16]: The next day , Friday , we had a large addition to our shooting party .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 49]: I had not been out more than an hour , when , as I was standing near Lord de Versely , who was re-loading his gun , a report , close to us , was heard , and I fell down close to his feet , apparently dead .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 65]: A keeper , who was with us , ran to see who had discharged the gun , and found that it was Colonel Delmar , who now ran up to us , stating , in hurried terms , to Lord de Versely , that his gun had gone off accidentally as he was putting on a copper cap , and bitterly lamenting the circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 27]: Lord de Versely was at the time kneeling down by my side -LRB- as I was afterwards informed -RRB- , showing the greatest anxiety and grief .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 25]: My hat had been taken off ; it was full of blood and the back of my head was much torn with the shot .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 29]: I remained insensible , although breathing heavily ; a gate was taken off its hinges , and I was laid upon it , and carried to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 12]: Before the surgeon had arrived , I had recovered my senses .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 38]: On examination , I had had a very narrow escape ; the better part of the charge of shot had entered the back part of my head , but fortunately not any had penetrated through the skull .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 26]: After a tedious hour , employed in extracting this load , my head was bound up , and I was made comfortable in my bed .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 44]: I must say that Lord de Versely and Colonel Delmar vied with each other in their attentions to me ; the latter constantly accusing himself as the author of the mischief , and watching by my bed the major part of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 25]: This accident delayed my departure , and it was not until three weeks afterwards , that I was sufficiently recovered to leave my room .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 21]: In the meantime , Lord de Versely , assured that I was out of danger , went back to London .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 7]: The colonel , however , remained .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 17]: His kindness and attention had given me great pleasure , and we had become very intimate .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 23]: He had offered to go with me to Portsmouth , and I had expressed the pleasure I should have in his company .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 49]: The Honourable Miss Delmar had shown the greatest feeling and anxiety for me during my illness ; so had Mr Warden , who often called to see me ; in fact , I found myself so surrounded by well-wishers and friends , that I hardly regretted my accident .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 43]: At the end of the fifth week , I was sufficiently recovered to be able to return to Portsmouth , where I was now very anxious to arrive , as the Circe had been launched and had already received her lower masts .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 33]: I took my leave of Miss Delmar , who requested my early return to Madeline Hall , and , accompanied by Colonel Delmar , was once more established at Billett 's Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 24]: Bob Cross was the first who made his appearance ; for I had written to him to acquaint him with my intended return .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 27]: He had heard of my narrow escape , as it had been put into the newspaper ; his information was trifling , but to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 32]: All was right as to the frigate : she sat on the water like a duck ; the rigging was far advanced , and the officers seemed of the right sort .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 40]: All was right , also , as to his matrimonial affairs ; his wife was every thing he wished ; the old gentleman was as sweet as molasses , and he had laid the keel of a young Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 22]: We then entered upon business , and I gave him some directions as to the rigging , and he left me .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 37]: The next morning , the first lieutenant called to pay his respects , and his appearance and conversation proved him to be what he had been recommended as , a good seaman and a brave man .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 36]: I went with him to the dockyard to look at the frigate in the basin , and afterwards on board the hulk to see the other officers and the men , who had been entered .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 22]: I had every reason to be satisfied , and I then returned to the hotel , to dine with Colonel Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 40]: This officer appeared to have taken a strong interest in me , and ever since the accident of his gun going off , which had so nearly been fatal to me , was unbounded in his professions of regard .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 17]: I must say , that a more gentleman-like or more amusing companion I never met with .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 76]: A great intimacy was established between us ; he was constantly making me presents of value , which I would fain have prevented his doing ; occasionally , when we were alone , he would hint something about my family and parentage ; but this was a subject upon which I was invariably silent , and I immediately changed the conversation ; once only I replied , that my father and mother were both dead .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 58]: On my arrival at Portsmouth , I found several letters waiting for me , and among them two or three from my mother , who had seen the report in the newspaper of the escape that I had had , and , of course , was excessively anxious to hear from my own hand how I was .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 67]: Had I thought that it would have come to her knowledge , I certainly should have written to my grandmother from Madeline Hall ; but I imagined that she knew nothing about it , until my return to Portsmouth , when her anxious letters proved the contrary ; for in her anxiety she had quite forgotten her promise that all communication should be through my grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 70]: As soon as I had read the letters I locked them up in my desk , and hastened to reply to them , assuring my mother of my perfect restoration to health , and cautioned her not to break through the agreement we had made for the future , pointing out to her that had these letters been forwarded to Madeline Hall , her handwriting would have been recognised .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 38]: I said , in conclusion , `` I must say , my dear mother , that I now heartily repent that we should have resorted to the step we have done in pretending that you are dead .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 29]: That some advantage was gained by it at the time , I really believe ; but I have a feeling that eventually some mischief may occur from it .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 36]: I hope I may be mistaken ; but if I am not , it will only be the punishment which I deserve for an act of duplicity which I have repented of ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 34]: My time was now fully employed during the day in fitting out the frigate ; but in the evening I generally dined out at the admiral 's or at the officers ' mess .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 44]: I received several invitations from the marine mess to dine with them ; but I always contrived to be engaged , for I was fearful that something might be said relative to my putative father , Ben , which might hurt my pride .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 73]: Not that I had any reason to suppose that any of the officers would have been guilty of any such rudeness ; but as a great deal of wine was drank when company were at the mess , and there were many young men there , it was possible that , having the knowledge , they might in their cups say something which they never would have done when they were sober .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 15]: The colonel very often dined there , and constantly asked me why I refused .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 21]: My reply was certainly not the truth , for I said that I was not very partial to marine officers .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 32]: We had been three weeks at Portsmouth when Colonel Delmar received a letter from a friend of his , a Major Stapleton , which he read aloud to me at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 24]: It stated that the major would be down at Portsmouth the next day , and requested the colonel to procure him good rooms .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 26]: `` He is an excellent fellow , the major , '' continued the colonel , `` and will be a great addition to our society .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 14]: I will prevail upon him to stay a week or ten days . ''
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 28]: On my return from the dock-yard on the following day , I found the colonel and Major Stapleton in our sitting-room , and was introduced to him .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 22]: He was a small , neatly-made man , with handsome features , very well dressed , and of very fashionable appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 30]: Still there was something in his eye which did not please me ; it was unsettled and wandering , and never fixed upon you for more than a second .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 28]: He met me with great warmth and _ empressement _ , shook me by the hand , and declared what pleasure he had in making my acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 11]: We sat down to dinner , and were very merry .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 18]: The major had been with us a week , when we had a large party to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 15]: The wine was passed freely , and we all were more or less elated .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 47]: The major appeared particularly so , and very much inclined to be quarrelsome , and as he constantly addressed himself to me , I was very cautious in what I said , as I perceived that he was in the humour to take offence at anything .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 63]: Several very offensive remarks were made by him , as if to pick a quarrel between us , but I parried them as well as I could , and I was making an observation , when the major started up , and told me that what I said was a lie , and that I was a scoundrel for having said so .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 46]: Now , as my observation was to my first lieutenant , and was in reference to the hold of the frigate , there could be no cause for this insult , and it could only be ascribed to his being in a state of intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 30]: My reply was very cool and quiet : `` Major , you do not know what you are saying ; but we will talk about it to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 17]: I then rose and went to my bed-room , and the whole party broke up immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 65]: Shortly afterwards , Colonel Delmar came into my room , and blaming the major very much for his conduct , ascribed it to intoxication and said that he would make him send a proper apology , which he had no doubt the next morning , when the major was informed of what he had done , he would be most anxious to offer himself .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 14]: I replied , that I presumed so ; and he quitted my room .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 43]: Indeed , so fully was I convinced of this in my own mind , that I gave it no further thought , and was soon fast asleep , and did not wake until Colonel Delmar entered my room at a late hour .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 67]: `` Well , colonel , '' said I. `` My dear Keene , '' said he , `` I have been to the major , and , to my surprise , when I stated to him what had passed at the table last night , his reply was , that he perfectly remembered all about it and that he would not retract what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 9]: I remonstrated with him , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 20]: He says , that it is cowardly to retract , and that he will never make an apology . ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 19]: `` Then , '' replied I , `` there is but one step for me to take . ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 28]: `` As our friend , I told him so , and pressed him very hard to acknowledge his error , but he continued steadfast in his refusal .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 29]: I then took upon myself to say that I was there as your friend , and begged he would name an officer to whom I might address myself .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 10]: Did I not right , my dear Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 21]: `` Certainly ; and I am very much obliged to you , '' replied I , putting on my dressing-gown .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 12]: `` He must be mad , utterly and positively mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 16]: exclaimed Colonel Delmar ; `` I regret very much that he has ever come here .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 48]: I know that some years ago , when he was younger , he fought two or three duels rather than make an apology ; but in this instance it was so unprovoked , and I had hoped that he had got over all that nonsense and obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 8]: Are you a good shot , Keene ?
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 8]: because he is a notorious one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 63]: `` I can hit my man , colonel ; it is true that I have only fought one duel in my life , and would make a great sacrifice rather than fight another ; but no alternative is left me in this case ; and if blood is shed , it must be on the head of him who provoked it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 23]: `` Very true , '' replied Colonel Delmar , biting his lip ; `` I only hope you will be successful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 36]: `` I have no particular animosity against Major Stapleton , '' replied I ; `` but as he is such a good shot , I shall in my own defence take good aim at him .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 39]: At all events , I have sufficient acquaintance with fire-arms , and have passed through too many bullets not to be cool and collected under fire , and I therefore consider myself quite a match for the major .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 26]: Now , colonel , if you will order the breakfast , I will be down in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 65]: As the colonel was going out of the room , his servant knocked at the door , and said that Captain Green wished to speak to him on particular business ; I therefore did not hurry myself , but proceeded quietly with my toilet , as I was well aware what the particular business was , and that the conference might last some time .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 12]: On my descending into the sitting-room I found the colonel alone .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 23]: `` Well , Keene , '' said he , `` everything is arranged , for the major is deaf to all expostulation .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 34]: You are to meet this evening , and , to avoid interference , Captain Green and I have agreed to say that the major has apologised , and all is made up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 34]: Of course I had no objection to make to that , and we parted for the present , I walking to the dock-yard , and he remaining at the hotel to write letters .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 50]: The reader may think that I took matters very coolly ; but the fact was , I had no preparations to make in case of accident , having no wife or family , and as to any other preparations at such a time , I considered them as mockery .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 48]: I knew that I was about to do what was wrong -- to offend my Creator -- and knowing that , and sinning with my eyes open , much as I regretted that I was compelled to do so , I was still resolved upon doing it .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 81]: How great may be the culpability in such cases when you are called upon to sacrifice all your worldly interests , and to be despised among men , or run the risk of involuntarily taking another person 's life , I could not pretend to judge ; but one thing was certain , that , however it may be judged in the next world , in this , among soldiers and sailors , it will always be considered as venial .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 18]: I did , therefore , what most in my profession would have done under the same circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 20]: I drove it from my thoughts as much as possible , until the time came to decide my fate .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 34]: I considered that I must be judged by the tenor of my whole life , and that repentance , under chance of death , was of about the same value as death-bed repentance .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 25]: As soon as the dock-yard men were mustered out , I returned to the hotel , and sat down to dinner with the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 16]: We had scarcely finished a bottle of claret when it was time to be off .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 21]: We walked out of the town , to the place appointed , where I found my adversary and his second .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 28]: The ground was marked out by the colonel , and , when I took my station , I found that the setting sun was in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 15]: I pointed it out to him , and requested my position might be changed .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 33]: The other second heard me do so , and very handsomely agreed that I was entitled to what I asked , and the colonel immediately apologised for his remissness to my interests .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 42]: The ground was then marked out in another direction , and the colonel took me to my place , where I observed that one of the white-washed posts was exactly behind me , making me a sure mark for my antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 24]: `` I am not used to these things , Keene , '' replied Colonel Delmar , `` and I make strange mistakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 14]: I then pointed out a direction which would be fair for both parties .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 12]: The pistols were then loaded , and put into our hands .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 6]: We fired at the signal .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 12]: I felt that I was hit , but my adversary fell .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 17]: I was paralysed ; and although I remained on my feet , I could not move .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 21]: Captain Green and the colonel went up to where my adversary lay : the ball had passed through his chest .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 15]: `` He is dead , '' said Captain Green -- `` quite dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' replied Colonel Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 24]: `` My dear Keene , I congratulate you : you have killed the greatest scoundrel that ever disgraced his Majesty 's uniform . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 27]: `` Colonel Delmar , '' replied Captain Green , `` the observation might well be spared : our errors and our follies die with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 36]: `` Very true , Captain Green , '' replied I. `` I can only express my surprise that the colonel should have introduced to me a person whose memory he now so bitterly assails . ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 40]: Somehow or another , from the commencement of the duel , Colonel Delmar 's conduct had excited my suspicions , and a hundred things crowded into my memory , which appeared as if illumined like a flash of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 17]: I came suddenly to the conviction that he was my enemy , and not my friend .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 43]: But I was bleeding fast : some marines , who were passing , were summoned , and the body of Major Stapleton was carried away by one party , while I was committed to another , and taken back to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 13]: The surgeon was sent for , and my wound was not dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 17]: The ball had gone deep into my thigh , but had missed any vessel of magnitude .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 12]: It was extracted , and I was left quiet in bed .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 18]: Colonel Delmar came up to me as before , but I received his professions with great coolness .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 36]: I told him that I thought it would be prudent of him to disappear until the affair had blown over ; but he declared to me that he would remain with me at every risk .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 34]: Shortly afterwards , Captain Green came into my room , and said , `` I 'm sure , Captain Keene , you will be glad to hear that Major Stapleton is not dead .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 19]: He had swooned , and is now come to , and the doctor thinks favourably of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 30]: `` I am indeed very glad , Captain Green ; for I had no animosity against the major , and his conduct to me has been quite incomprehensible . ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 74]: After inquiry about my wound , and expressing a hope that I should soon be well , Captain Green left ; but I observed that he took no further notice of Colonel Delmar than a haughty salute as he quitted the room ; and then , to my surprise , Colonel Delmar said that , upon consideration , he thought it would be advisable for him to go away for a certain time .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 17]: `` I agree with you , '' replied I ; `` it would be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 54]: I said this , because I did not wish his company ; for it at once struck me as very strange that he should , now that Major Stapleton was alive and promising to do well , talk of departure , when he refused at the time he supposed him to be killed .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 27]: I was therefore very glad when in an hour or two afterwards he took his leave , and started , as he said , for London .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 16]: My recovery was rapid : in less than a fortnight I was on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 38]: The frigate was now rigged , and had taken in her water and stores , and was reported ready for sea in a month , as we still required about forty men to make up our complement .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 51]: I saw a great deal of Captain Green , who paid me a visit almost every day ; and once , when our conversation turned upon the duel , I made the same remark as I did when Colonel Delmar used such harsh language over the body of Major Stapleton .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied Captain Green , `` I thought it was my duty to tell him what Colonel Delmar had said .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 20]: He was very much excited , and replied , ` The _ greatest _ scoundrel , did he say ?
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 22]: -- then is the devil better than those he tempts ; however , we are both in each other 's power .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 13]: I must get well first , and then I will act . '
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 17]: There certainly is some mystery , the attack was so unprovoked , the determination so positive .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 16]: Have you any reason to suppose that Colonel Delmar is your enemy , Captain Keene ?
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 26]: for certainly he did appear to me to do all he could at the time of the duel to give your adversary the advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 37]: `` I really have no cause to suppose that he has grounds for being my enemy ; but I can not help suspecting that , for some reason or reasons unknown , he is so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 24]: When Captain Green had left me , I tried all I could to find out why Colonel Delmar should be inimical to me .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 32]: That he was the supposed heir to Miss Delmar I knew ; but surely her leaving me a few thousands was not sufficient cause for a man to seek my life .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 20]: Lord de Versely had nothing to leave ; I could come to no conclusion that was at all satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 27]: I then thought whether I would write to Lord de Versely , and tell him what had happened ; but I decided that I would not .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 34]: The initials had been put in the papers at the announcement of the duel , and , had he seen them , he certainly would have written down to inquire about the facts .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 24]: My mother had so done , and I resolved that I would answer her letter , which had hitherto remained on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 24]: I sent for my desk , and when my servant brought it me , the bunch of keys were hanging to the lock .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 92]: I thought this strange , as I had locked my desk before I went out to meet Major Stapleton , and had never sent for it since my return ; my servant , however , could tell me nothing about it , except that he found it as he brought it to me ; but after a little time , he recollected that the doctor had asked for a pen and ink to write a prescription , and that the colonel had taken the keys to get him what he required .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 14]: This accounted for it , and nothing more was said upon the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 20]: Of course , although it was known , no notice was taken of what had passed by the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 32]: I had not even put myself down in the sick report , but signed my daily papers , and sent them into the admiral 's office as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 23]: In six weeks I was able to limp about a little , and the Circe was at last reported ready for sea .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 26]: My orders came down , and I was to sail with the first fair wind to join the squadron in the Texel and North Sea .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 97]: I had taken up my quarters on board , and was waiting two days , while the wind still blew hard from the eastward , when my promise to write to Mr Warden occurred to me ; and , as I had closed all my despatches to Lord de Versely -- the Honourable Miss Delmar , to whom I made my excuse for not being able to pay my respects before my departure -- my mother , and my aunt Bridgeman -- I resolved that I would write him a long letter previous to my sailing .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 50]: I did so , in which I entered into the whole affair of the duel , the conduct of Colonel Delmar , and my suspicions relative to him ; stating , at the same time , that I could not comprehend why he should have sought to injure me .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 26]: I finished this letter late in the evening , and the next morning , the wind having come round , we sailed for our destination .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 15]: Once more on the water , all my thoughts were given to the service .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 59]: We soon fell in with the North Sea squadron , and the day afterwards the Circe was directed to go on shore in company with the Dryad , and watch the flotillas of gun-boats which had been collecting in the various rivers and ports ; to sink , burn , and destroy to the utmost of our power .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 37]: This was an active and dangerous service , as the enemy had every advantage in the sands and shoals , and hardly a day passed in which we were not engaged with the flotillas and batteries .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 42]: It was , however , now fine weather , for the winter had set in early , and had passed away , and for two months we continued in the service , during which my skip 's company were well trained .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 41]: One morning a cutter from the fleet was reported from the mast-head , and we expected that we should soon have our letters from England , when the Dryad threw out the signal for six sail of praams in shore .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 19]: The two frigates made all sail in chase , leaving the cutter to follow us how she could .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 23]: Our masters were well acquainted with the shoals on the coast , and we threaded our way through them towards the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 29]: We were within gun-shot , and had exchanged broadsides with the batteries , when the flotillas gained a small harbour , which prevented our making any further attempts .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 32]: The Dryad made the signal to haul off ; it was quite time , as we had not more than four hours ' daylight , and were entangled among the shoals .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 22]: The breeze , which had been fresh , now increased very rapidly , and there was every appearance of a gale .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 49]: We worked out as fast as we could , and by nine o'clock in the evening we were clear of the sands , and in the open sea ; but the gale had sprung up so rapidly that we were obliged to reduce our sail to close-reefed topsails .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 71]: With the sands under our lee , it was necessary to draw off as fast as we could , and we therefore carried a heavy press of sail all the night -- at last , the wind was so strong that we could only carry close-reefed maintop-sail and reefed fore-sail ; and with a heavy sea , which had risen up , we felt that we were in extreme danger .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 7]: Daylight once more made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 12]: Our first object was to ascertain the position of the Dryad .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 44]: For a long time we looked in vain ; at last , a partial clearing up of the horizon on the lee bow discovered her , looming through the heavy atmosphere , more like a phantom ship than the work of mortal hands .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 12]: She was a deep grey mass upon a lighter grey ground .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 22]: Her top-masts were gone , and she was pitching and rising without appearing to advance under her courses and storm staysails .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 24]: `` There she is , sir , '' said Mr Wilson ; `` and if the gale lasts , good-bye to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 39]: `` If the gale lasts , Mr Wilson , '' said I in a low voice , `` I suspect you may sing our requiem as well ; but we must trust to Heaven and our own exertions .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 9]: Pass along the lead-line , Mr Hawkins . ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 22]: `` Aye , aye , sir , '' replied the officer of the watch ; `` how much out sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 5]: `` Forty fathoms . ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 25]: The men ranged themselves along the lee-bulwarks , chains , and gangway and passed the deep sea-lines from aft to the anchor stock forward .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 33]: The deep sea lead was taken forward , and as soon as it was bent and ready , the ship was thrown up to the wind so as to check her way .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 93]: `` Heave , '' and the lead was thrown , and as it descended the line was dropped from the hands of the men , one after another , as the line drew aft ; but when it came to the hands of the master , who was on the quarter , instead of finding , as he expected , forty fathoms of water , he had to haul in the slack line for such a length of time , that the lead was astern and no proper soundings could be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 60]: One thing was , however , certain , which was , that we were in much shallower water than we had any idea of ; and the master , much alarmed , desired the quarter-master to go into the chains and see if he could get soundings with the hand-lead while the men were hauling in the deep sea-line .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 41]: The quarter-master was forestalled by Bob Cross who , dropping into the chains , cleared the line , and swinging it but twice or thrice , for there was little or no way in the vessel , let it go .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 37]: The anxiety with which the descent of the line was watched by me , the master , and other of the officers who were hanging over the hammock rails , it would be difficult to describe .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 9]: When sixteen fathoms were out the lead sounded .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 16]: Cross gathered up the slack line , and fourteen and a half fathoms was announced .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 19]: `` Mr Hillyer , '' said I , `` oblige me by coming down into the cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 6]: The master followed me immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 10]: The chart was on the table in the fore-cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 12]: `` We must have gone to leeward dreadfully , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 34]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` but the sweep of the currents in heavy gales is so tremendous , and so uncertain on this coast , that I am not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 29]: We must have had a South East current , and probably we are hereabouts , '' continued I , putting the point of the compass upon the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 55]: `` It seems hardly possible , sir , '' replied the master ; `` but still I fear it must be so ; and if so , '' continued he , drawing a deep sigh , `` I 'm afraid it 's all over with us , without a miracle in our favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 45]: `` I am of your opinion , Mr Hillyer ; but say nothing about it , '' replied I ; `` the gale _ may _ moderate , the wind _ may _ shift , and if so we _ may _ be saved .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 28]: At all events , it 's no use telling bad news too soon , and therefore you 'll oblige me by not saying anything on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 9]: A few hours will decide our fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 43]: `` But the Dryad , she is good four miles to the leeward of us , and the soundings decrease here so rapidly , that in an hour , with the sail she is under , she must go on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 30]: `` She has no chance , that 's certain , '' replied I. `` I only hope it may be so thick that we may not see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 17]: `` Not a soul will be saved , sir , '' replied the master , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 48]: `` I should say it were impossible , Mr Hillyer ; but we all owe Heaven a death ; and if they go first and we go after them , at all events , let us do our duty until the time comes -- but never despair .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 32]: As long as there is life , there is hope ; so now let us go on deck , and put as good a face on it as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 9]: I returned on deck followed by the master .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 29]: `` The barometer is rising , '' said I aloud , to the first lieutenant ; `` so I presume the gale will break about twelve o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 24]: `` I am glad to hear of it , sir ; for we have quite enough of it , '' replied the first-lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 8]: `` Do you see the Dryad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 23]: `` No , sir ; it 's quite thick again to leeward : we have not seen her these ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 16]: Thank God for that , thought I , for they will never see her again .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 8]: `` What soundings had you last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 7]: `` Fourteen fathoms , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 32]: `` I expect we shall cross the tail of the bank in much less , '' replied I ; `` but , when once clear , we shall have sea-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 43]: As the captain is an oracle in times of danger , the seamen caught every word which was uttered from my mouth ; and what they gathered from what I had said , satisfied them that they were in no immediate danger .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 17]: Nevertheless , the master walked the deck as if he was stupefied with the impending crisis .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 35]: No wonder , poor fellow ; with a wife and family depending upon him for support , it is not to be expected that a man can look upon immediate dissolution without painful feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 36]: A sailor should never marry : or if he does , for the benefit of the service , his marriage should prove an unhappy one , and then he would become more reckless than before .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 24]: As for my own thoughts , they may be given in a few words -- they were upon the vanity of human wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 70]: Whatever I had done with the one object I had in view -- whatever might have been my success had I lived -- whether I might have been wedded to Minnie some future day , or what may have resulted , good , bad , or indifferent , as to future , all was to be , in a few hours , cut short by the will of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 75]: In the next world there was neither marriage nor giving in marriage -- in the next world , name , titles , wealth , everything worldly was as nought -- and all I had to do was to die like a man , and do my duty to the last , trusting to a merciful God to forgive me my sins and offences ; and with this philosophy I stood prepared for the event .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 25]: About noon it again cleared up to leeward , but the Dryad was no longer to be seen : this was reported to me .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 42]: As it was nearly three hours since we last had a sight of her , I knew her fate too well -- she had plenty of time to go on shore , and to be broken up by the heavy seas .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 32]: I did however point my glass in the direction , and coolly observed , `` she has rounded the tail of the bank , I presume , and has bore up .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 10]: It was the best thing she could do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 19]: I then asked the master if he had wound his chronometers , and went down into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 34]: I had not , however , been examining the chart more than a minute , when the officer of the watch came down , and reported that we had shoaled to twelve fathoms .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 15]: `` Very good , Mr Hawkins ; we shall be in shallower water yet .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 13]: Let me know if there is any change in the soundings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 35]: As soon as the cabin door was again shut , I worked up the tide to see when it would change against us ; I found that it had changed one hour at least .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 15]: Then it will be sooner over , thought I , throwing down the pencil .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 25]: `` Mr Cross , the boatswain , wishes to speak to you , sir , '' said the sentry , opening the cabin door .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 21]: `` Tell him to come in , '' replied I. `` Well , Cross , what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 37]: `` I was speaking to the first lieutenant about getting up a runner , sir -- the fore-stay is a good deal chafed ; that is , if you think it 's of any use . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 13]: `` How do you mean , of any use , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 51]: `` Why , sir , although no one would suppose it from you -- but if the face of the master -LRB- and he is not a faint-hearted man neither -RRB- is to be taken as a barometer , we shall all be in ` kingdom come ' before long .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 22]: I 've cruised in these seas so often , that I pretty well guess where we are , Captain Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 34]: `` Well , Cross , it 's no use denying that we are in a mess , and nothing but the wind going down or changing can get us out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 24]: `` Just as I thought sir ; well , it ca n't be helped , so it 's no use fretting about it .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 21]: I think myself that the gale is breaking , and that we shall have fine weather by to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 29]: `` That will be rather too late , Cross ; for I think we shall be done for in three or four hours , if not sooner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 18]: `` Eleven fathoms , sir , '' said the officer of the watch , coming in hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 18]: `` Very well , Mr Hawkins ; let her go through the water , '' replied I .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 34]: As soon as the cabin door was again shut , I said , `` You see , Cross , the tide is now against us , and this will not last long . ''
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 17]: `` No , sir ; we shall strike in five fathoms with this heavy sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 29]: `` I know we shall ; but I do not wish to dishearten the men before it is necessary , and then we must do our best . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 25]: `` You wo n't be offended , I am sure , by my asking , Captain Keene , what you think of doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 24]: `` Not at all , Cross ; it is my intention to explain it to the ship 's company before I do it .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 11]: I may as well take your opinion upon it now .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 20]: As soon as we are in six fathoms , I intend to cut away the masts and anchor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 37]: `` That 's our only chance , sir , and if it is well done , and the gale abates , it may save some of us ; but how do you intend to anchor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 36]: `` I shall back the best bower with the sheet , and let go the small bower at the same time that I do the sheet , so as to ride an even strain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 22]: `` You ca n't do better , sir ; but that will require time for preparation , to be well done .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 20]: Do you think that we shall have time , if you wait till we are in six fathoms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 27]: `` I do n't know but you are right , Cross , and I think it would be better to commence our preparations at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 14]: `` Ten fathoms , sir , '' reported the officer of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 12]: `` Very well , I will be on deck directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 69]: `` Well , sir , we must now go to our duty ; and as we may chance not to talk to one another again , sir , '' said Cross , `` I can only say God bless you , and I hope that , if we do not meet again in this world , we shall in heaven , or as near to it as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 5]: Good-bye , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 26]: `` Good-bye , Cross , '' replied I , shaking him by the hand ; `` we 'll do our duty , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 9]: So now for my last dying speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 10]: Cross quitted the cabin , and I followed him .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 24]: As soon as I was on deck , I desired the first lieutenant to turn the hands up , and send them aft .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 67]: When they were all assembled , with Cross at their head , I stood on one of the carronades and said : `` My lads , I have sent for you , because I consider that , although the gale is evidently breaking , we are shoaling our water so fast , that we are in danger of going on shore before the gale does break .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 40]: Now , what I intend to do , as our best chance , is to cut away the masts , and anchor as soon as we are in six fathoms water ; perhaps we may then ride it out .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 17]: At all events , we must do our best , and put our trust in Providence .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 56]: But , my lads , you must be aware , that in times of difficulty it is important that we should be all cool and collected , that you must adhere to your discipline , and obey your officers to the last ; if you do not , everything will go wrong instead of right .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 21]: You have proved yourselves an excellent set of men , and I 'm sure you will continue so to do .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 78]: It is possible we may not have to cut away our masts , or to anchor ; still , we must make every preparation in case it is necessary , and I have , therefore , sent for you , to explain my intentions , and to request that you will all assist me to the best of your abilities ; and I feel convinced that you will , and will do your duty like British seamen .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 11]: That 's all I have to say , my lads .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 7]: Pipe down , Mr Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 9]: The ship 's company went forward in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 9]: They perceived the full extent of the danger .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 39]: The first lieutenant and boatswain employed a portion in backing the best bower anchor with the sheet ; the others roued up the cables from the tiers , and coiled them on the main-deck , clear for running .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 14]: All hands were busily employed , and employment made them forget their fears .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 11]: The work was done silently , but orderly and steadily .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 30]: In the meantime we had shoaled to eight fathoms , and it was now nearly three o'clock ; but as it was summer time , the days were long .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 28]: Indeed , when the weather was fine , there was little or no night , and the weather was warm , which was all in our favour .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 20]: When everything was reported ready , I went round to examine and ascertain if the cables would run clear .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 68]: Satisfied that all was right , I then picked out the men , and appointed those who were most trustworthy to the stations of importance ; and , having so done , I then returned to the quarter-deck , and called up the carpenter and some of the topmen to be ready with the axes to cut away the masts and lashings of the booms and boats .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 14]: Just as these orders were completed , the gale blew fiercer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 15]: We were now in seven fathoms water , and pressed heavy by the gale .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 28]: I stood at the break of the gangway , the first lieutenant and master by my side , and Cross a little forward , watching my eye .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 36]: The men in the chains continued to give the soundings in a clear steady voice , `` By the mark seven , '' `` Quarter less seven , '' `` And a half six . ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 65]: At last , the man in the chains next to me , a fine old forecastle man , gave the sounding `` By the mark six , '' and he gave it with a louder voice than before , with a sort of defiance , as much as to say , `` The time is come , let the elements do their worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 5]: The time was come .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 7]: `` Silence , fore and aft .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 11]: Every man down under the half-deck , except those stationed .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 12]: Cut away the boom lashings , and clear the boats . ''
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 8]: This was soon done , and reported .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 10]: `` Now then , my lads , be steady .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 9]: Cut away the lanyards in the chains . ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 100]: One after another the lanyards and backstays were severed ; the masts groaned and creaked , and then the fore-mast and main-mast were over the side almost at the same time ; the mizen followed , as the frigate broached to and righted , leaving the ship 's deck a mass of wreck and confusion ; but no one was hurt , from the precautions which had been taken , the mast having been cut away before we rounded to , to anchor , as otherwise , they would have fallen aft and not gone clear of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 7]: `` Stand by the best bower .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 6]: Stand clear of the cable .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 6]: Let go the anchor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 33]: As soon as the best bower cable was nearly out , the sheet anchor and small bower were let go at the same moment , and the result was to be ascertained .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 3]: CHAPTER FORTY .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 33]: The frigate was head to wind , rising and pitching with the heavy sea , but not yet feeling the strain of the cables : the masts lay rolling and beating alongside .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 38]: The ship 's company had most of them returned on deck , to view their impending fate , and the carpenters , who had already received their orders , were battening down the hatchways on the main-deck .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 54]: In a minute the frigate rode to her anchors , and as soon as the strain was on the cables , she dipped , and a tremendous sea broke over her bows , deluging us fore and aft , nearly filling the main-deck , and washing the carpenters away from their half-completed work .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 37]: A second and a third followed , rolling aft , so as to almost bury the vessel , sweeping away the men who clung to the cordage and guns , and carrying many of them overboard .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 27]: I had quitted the gangway , where there was no hold , and had repaired to the main bitts , behind the stump of the main-mast .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 83]: Even in this position I should not have been able to hold on , if it had not been for Bob Cross , who was near me , and who passed a rope round my body as I was sweeping away ; but the booms and boats which had been cut adrift , in case of the ship driving on shore broadside , were driven aft with the last tremendous sea , and many men on the quarter-deck were crushed and mangled .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 42]: After the third sea had swept over us , there was a pause , and Cross said to me , `` We had better go down on the main-deck , Captain Keene , and get the half-ports open if possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 81]: We did so , and with great difficulty , found the people to help us ; for , as it may be imagined , the confusion was now very great ; but the carpenters were again collected , and the half-ports got out , and then the battening down was completed ; for , although she continued to ship seas fore and aft , they were not so heavy as the three first , which had so nearly swamped her .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 16]: I again went on deck , followed by Cross , who would not leave me .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 62]: Most of the men had lashed themselves to the guns and belaying pins , but I looked in vain for the first lieutenant and master ; they were standing at the gangway at the time of the first sea breaking over us , and it is to be presumed that they were washed overboard , for I never saw them again .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 52]: We had hardly been on deck , and taken our old position at the bitts , when the heavy seas again poured over us ; but the booms having been cleared , and the ports on the main-deck open , they did not sweep us with the same force as before .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 21]: `` She can not stand this long , Bob , '' said I , as we clung to the bitts .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 34]: `` No , sir , the cables must part with such a heavy strain ; or if they do not , we shall drag our anchors till we strike on the sands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 10]: `` And then we shall go to pieces ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 23]: `` Yes , sir ; but do not forget to get to the wreck of the masts , if you possibly can .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 8]: The best chance will be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 16]: `` Bad 's the best , Cross ; however , that was my intention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 147]: The reader will be surprised at my having no conversation with any other party but Cross ; but the fact was , that although it was only occasionally that a heavy sea poured over us , we were blinded by the continual spray in which the frigate was enveloped , and which prevented us not only from seeing our own position , but even a few feet from us ; and , as if any one who had not a firm hold when the seas poured over the deck , was almost certain to be washed overboard , every man clung to where he was ; indeed , there were not fifty men on deck ; for those who had not been washed overboard by the first seas , had hastened to get under the half-deck ; and many had been washed overboard in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 52]: The most painful part was to hear the moaning and cries for help of the poor fellows who lay jammed under the heavy spars and boats which had been washed aft , and to whom it was impossible to afford any relief without the assistance of a large body of men .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 17]: But all I have described since the anchors were let go occurred in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 32]: On a sudden , the frigate heeled over to starboard , and at the same time a sea broke over her chesstree , which nearly drowned us where we were clinging .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 52]: As soon as the pouring off of the water enabled us to recover our speech , `` She has parted , Cross , and all is over with us , '' said I. `` Yes , sir ; as soon as she strikes , she will break up in ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 13]: We must not stay here , as she will part amidships . ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 30]: I felt the truth of the observation , and , waiting until a heavy sea had passed over us , contrived to gain the after ladder , and descend .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 39]: As soon as we were on the main deck , we crawled to the cabin , and seated ourselves by the after-gun , Cross having made a hold on to a ring-bolt for us with his silk neck-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 13]: There were many men in the cabin , silently waiting their doom .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 28]: They knew that all was over , that nothing could be done , yet they still contrived to touch their hats respectfully to me as I passed .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 51]: `` My lads , '' said I , as soon as I had secured my hold , `` the cables have parted , and the ship will strike , and go to pieces in a very short time ; recollect that the masts to leeward are your best chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 42]: Those who were near me said , `` Thank you , Captain Keene ; '' but the words were scarcely out of their mouths , when a shock passed through the whole vessel , and communicated itself to our very hearts .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 50]: The ship had struck on the sand , and the beams and timbers had not ceased trembling and groaning , when a sea struck her larboard broadside , throwing her over on her beam-ends , so that the starboard side of the main-deck and the guns were under water .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 26]: It would be impossible after this to detail what occurred in a clear and correct manner , as the noise and confusion were so terrible .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 17]: At every sea hurled against the sides of the vessel the resistance to them became less .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 68]: What with the crashing of the beams , the breaking up of the timbers , and the guns to windward , as their fastenings gave way , tumbling with a tremendous crash to leeward , and passing through the ship 's sides , the occasional screams mixed with the other noise , the pouring , dashing , and washing of the waters , the scene was appalling .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 30]: At last , one louder crash than any of the former announced that the vessel had yielded to the terrific force of the waves , and had parted amidships .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 55]: After this there was little defence against them , even where we were clinging , for the waters poured in , as if maddened by their success , through the passage formed by the separation of the vessel , and came bounding on , as if changing their direction on purpose to overwhelm us .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 52]: As the two parts of the vessel were thrown higher up , the shocks were more severe , and indeed , the waves appeared to have more power than before , in consequence of their being so increased in weight from the quantity of sand which was mixed up with them .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 3]: Another crash !
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 34]: the sides of the after-part of the vessel had given way , and the heavy guns , disengaged , flew to leeward , and we found ourselves without shelter from the raging waters .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 29]: The part of the wreck on which Cross and I were sitting was so completely on its beam-ends that the deck was within a trifle of being perpendicular .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 35]: To walk was impossible : all that we could do was to slide down into the water to leeward ; but little was to be gained by that , as there was no egress .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 32]: We therefore remained for more than an hour in the same position , wearied with clinging , and the continual suffocation we received from the waves , as they deluged us .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 72]: We perceived that the wreck was gradually settling down deeper and deeper in the sand ; it was more steady in consequence , but at the same time the waves had more power over the upper part ; and so it proved ; for one enormous sea came in , blowing up the quarter deck over our heads , tearing away the planking and timbers , and hurling them to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 61]: This , at all events , set us free , although it exposed us more than before ; we could now see about us , that is , we could see to leeward , and Cross pointed out to me the mainmast tossing about in the boiling water , with the main-top now buried , and now rising out clear .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 7]: I nodded my head in assent .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 20]: He made a sign to say that he would go first after the next wave had passed over us .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 33]: I found myself alone , and as soon as I had cleared my eyes of the salt-water , I perceived Cross in the surge to leeward , making for the floating mast .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 9]: He gained it , and waved his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 33]: I immediately followed him , and , after a short buffet , gained a place by his side , just behind the main-top , which afforded us considerable shelter from the seas .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 55]: Indeed , as the main-mast was in a manner anchored by the lee rigging to the wreck of the vessel , the latter served as a breakwater , and the sea was , therefore , comparatively smooth , and I found my position infinitely more agreeable than when I was clinging on the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 30]: I could now breathe freely , as it was seldom I was wholly under water ; neither was it necessary , as before , to cling for your life .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 18]: On looking round me , I found that about twenty men were hanging on to the mast .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 19]: Many of them appeared quite exhausted , and had not strength left to obtain a more favourable berth .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 57]: The position taken by Cross and myself was very secure , being between the main-top and the catharpings , and the water was so warm that we did not feel the occasional immersion ; five other men were close to us , but not a word was said , -- indeed , hardly a recognition exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 18]: At that time we thought only of immediate preservation , and had little feeling for anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 38]: The night was now coming on ; the rolling waves changed from the yellow tinge given by the sand to green , and then to purple : at last all was black except the white foaming breakers .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 77]: Exhausted with fatigue , it had not been dark more than two hours , when I felt an irresistible desire to sleep , and I have no doubt that I did slumber in this position , half in and half out of the water , for some time ; for when I was roused up by losing my balance , I looked above and perceived that the sky was clear , and the stars shining brightly .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 39]: I then looked around me , and it was evident that the water was not so agitated as it had been ; the wind too had subsided ; its roaring had ceased , although it still whistled strong .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 4]: `` Cross ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 16]: said I. `` Here I am , Captain Keene , close under your lee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 16]: `` The gale is broke ; we shall have fair weather before the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir ; I have thought so some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 22]: `` Thank God for His mercy ; we must trust that He will not leave us here to perish miserably . ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 28]: `` No , I hope not , '' replied Cross ; `` let us trust in Him , but I confess I see but little chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 15]: `` So have many others , yet they have been saved , Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 18]: `` Very true , sir , '' replied he : `` I wish it was daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 32]: We had , however , three or four hours to wait ; but during that time the wind gradually subsided , and then went down to a light and fitful breeze .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 39]: At dawn of day the mast rose and fell with the swell of the sea , which still heaved after the late commotion , but without any run in any particular direction , for it was now calm .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 42]: I had been sitting on the mast with my back against the futtock-shrouds ; I now rose up with difficulty , for I was sorely bruised , and stood upon the mast clear from the water , to look around me .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 18]: About thirty yards from us was the wreck of the foremast with many men clinging to it .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: The mizen-mast had broken adrift .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 50]: The fore part of the frigate was several feet above water , and the bowsprit steeved in the air ; of the after part there were but three or four broken timbers to be seen clear of the water , so deep had it been buried in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 30]: Cross had risen on his feet , and was standing by me , when we were hailed from the wreck of the fore-mast , `` Main-mast , ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 4]: `` Halloo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 3]: replied Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 10]: `` Have you got the captain on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied Bob ; `` all alive and hearty ; '' a faint huzzah which was the return , affected me sensibly .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 59]: That my men should think of me when in such a position was soothing to my feelings ; but as I looked at them on the other mast and those around me , and calculated that there could not be more than forty men left out of such a noble ship 's company , I could have wept .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 45]: But it was time for action : `` Cross , '' said I , `` now that it is calm , I think we shall be better on the fore part of the frigate than here , half in and half out of water .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 40]: The forecastle is still remaining , and the weather bulwarks will shelter the men ; besides if any vessels should come in sight , we should more easily be able to make signals and to attract their attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 38]: `` Very true , sir , '' replied Cross ; `` and as there are many men here who can not hold on much longer , we must try if we can not haul them on board .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 12]: Do you feel strong enough to swim to the wreck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 8]: `` Yes , quite , Cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 16]: `` Then we 'll start together , sir , and see how matters are . ''
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 92]: I dropped into the sea , followed by Cross ; and as the distance from us was not forty yards , we soon gained the wreck of the fore part of the frigate ; the lee gunnel was just above the water ; we clambered over it , and found the deck still whole ; the weather portion as white as snow , and quite dry : we gained the weather bulwarks , and looked in the offing in case there should be any vessel , but we could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 23]: `` Now , sir , we had better hail , and tell all those who can swim to come to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 19]: We did so , and six men from the main-mast and nine from the fore-mast soon joined us .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 28]: `` Now , my lads , '' said I , `` we must look after those who can not get here , and try to save them .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 38]: Get all the ends of ropes from the belaying pins , bend them on one to another , and then we will return and make the men fast , and you shall haul them on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 22]: This was soon done ; Cross and I took the end in our hands , and swam back to the main-mast .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 42]: One of the top-men , with a broken , arm was the first that was made fast , and , when the signal was given , hauled through the water to the wreck ; six or seven more followed in succession .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 24]: Two men swam back every time with the rope and accompanied those who were hauled on board , that they might not sink .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 23]: There were many more hanging to different parts of the main-mast , but on examination they were found to be quite dead .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 29]: We sent on board all that showed any symptoms of life , and then we swam to the fore-mast , and assisted those who were hanging to it .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 18]: In about two hours our task was completed , and we mustered twenty-six men on the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 35]: We were glad to shelter ourselves under the bulwark , where we all lay huddled up together ; before noon , most of the poor fellows had forgotten their sufferings in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 38]: Cross , I , and the man with the broken arm , were the only three awake ; the latter was in too much pain to find repose , and , moreover , suffered from extreme thirst .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 26]: A breeze now sprang up from the southward , which cheered our spirits , as without wind there was little chance of receiving any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 11]: Night again came on , and the men still slept .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 53]: Cross and I laid down , and were glad to follow their example : the night was cold , and when we lay down we did not yet feel much from hunger or thirst ; but when the morning dawned we woke in suffering , not from hunger , but from thirst .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 6]: Everybody cried out for water .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 46]: I told the men that talking would only make them feel it more , and advised them to put their shirt sleeves in their mouths , and suck them ; and then I climbed upon the bulwarks to see if there was anything in sight .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 38]: I knew that the greatest chance was that the cutter would be looking after us ; but , at the same time , it was not yet likely that she would come so near to the sands .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 16]: I had been an hour on the gunnel , when Cross came up to me .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 25]: `` It 's banking up , sir to the southward : I hope we are not going to have any more bad weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 43]: `` I have no fear of a gale , although we may have thick weather , '' replied I ; `` that would be almost as bad for us , as we should perish on the wreck before we are discovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 24]: `` I am going to lower myself down into the galley , Captain Keene , to see if I can find anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 25]: `` I fear you will not be successful , '' replied I , `` for the coppers and ranges are all carried away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 25]: `` I know that , sir ; but I have been thinking of the cook 's closet we had built up above the bowsprit .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 19]: I know that he used to stow away many things there , and perhaps there may be something .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 19]: I believe the shortest way will be to go to leeward , and swim round to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 12]: Cross then left me , and I continued to look out .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 37]: About an hour afterwards he returned , and told me that he had easily opened it with his knife , and had found eight or nine pounds of raw potatoes , and a bucketful of slush .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 57]: `` We are not hungry enough to eat this now , sir ; but there is enough to keep the life in us all for three or four days at least ; that is , if we could get water , and I expect we shall feel the want of that dreadfully in a short time .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 38]: I would give a great deal if I could only find a drop to give that poor fellow Anderson , with his broken arm ; it is terribly swelled , and he must suffer very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 23]: `` Did you find anything in the closet to put water into , Cross ; in case we should get any ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 19]: `` Yes ; there 's two or three kids , and some small breakers , Captain Keene . ''
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 39]: `` Well , then , you had better get them ready ; for those clouds rise so fast , that we may have rain before morning , and if so , we must not lose the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 15]: `` Why , it does look like rain , sir , '' replied Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 21]: `` I 'll take one or two of the men with me , to assist in getting them up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 10]: I watched the horizon till night again set in .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 28]: We were all very faint and distressed for water , and the cool of the evening somewhat relieved us ; the breeze , too , was fresh .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 24]: The men had remained quietly in the shade as I had advised them ; but , although patient , they evidently suffered much .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 11]: Once more we all attempted to forget ourselves in repose .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 13]: I was soundly asleep , when I was woke up by Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 33]: `` Captain Keene , it is raining , and it will soon rain much harder ; now , if you will order the men , they will soon collect water enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 16]: `` Call them up immediately , Cross ; we must not lose this providential succour .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 8]: It may save all our lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 81]: The men were soon on the alert : the rain came down in a steady shower ; and as soon as they were wet through , they took off their shirts , and dabbling them into the water as it ran down to leeward , squeezed it out into their mouths , until their wants were satisfied , and then , under the direction of Cross , commenced filling the three breakers and four tubs which had been brought up .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 19]: They had time to fill them , and to spare , for the rain continued till the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 27]: The tubs and breakers were securely slung under the fore-bitts for future use , and they then continued to drink till they could drink no more .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 15]: The sun rose and chased away the clouds , and the heat was overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 16]: What would have been our situation if it had not pleased Heaven to refresh us ?
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 24]: The consequence of their thirst being appeased made the demand for food imperative , and a raw potato was given to each man .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 35]: The day passed , and so did a third , and fourth , and our hopes began to fail us , when at daylight the next morning I spied a sail to the westward .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 26]: The breeze was light but the vessel was evidently coming down towards us , and before noon we made it out to be the cutter .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 22]: We then sat on the bulwarks , and held out a white shirt , as a signal to attract their attention .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 51]: When about three miles from us , the cutter rounded to , not appearing to notice us , and for two hours we were left in this state of maddening anxiety and suspense , when at last we perceived her bows pay off , and she again stood towards us .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 33]: They had at last seen us , and as soon as they had run down to within three cables ' length , the boat was lowered and sent to take us off .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 17]: In three trips we were all on board , and devoutly thanked Heaven for our preservation .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 70]: The lieutenant of the cutter said that at first the sun prevented his seeing us , which I believe was the fact ; but he acknowledged that he had no idea that we had been wrecked , although he thought that the Dryad was , as he had seen a mast floating , and , sending a boat to look at it , found her name on the cross-trees .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 14]: We were , however , too much exhausted to enter into much conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 30]: As soon as we had been supplied with food , we were all put to bed in their hammocks ; the first lieutenant resigned his standing bed-place to me .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 35]: A long sleep recovered me , and I felt little the worse for what I had suffered , and sat down to a breakfast at noon on the following day with a good appetite .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 27]: The cutter had , by my directions , shaped a course for the island of Heligoland , where we should find means of returning to England .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 26]: `` I have letters for you , Captain Keene , '' said the lieutenant , `` if you are well enough to read them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 23]: `` Thank you , Mr D -- ; I am now quite well , and will be happy to have them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 26]: The lieutenant brought me a large packet , and I took a position on the sofa to read them comfortably while he went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 42]: I first opened those on service -- those , of course , had little interest for me , now that I had lost my ship -- I skimmed them over , and then threw them on the table one after another .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 24]: There were three private letters from England , one of which was in Lord de Versely 's hand-writing ; I opened it first .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 18]: It was very kind , but short , complaining that he had not been very well lately .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 7]: The second was from my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 24]: I read it ; it contained nothing of importance ; and then I took up the third , which had a black seal .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 37]: I opened it ; it was from Mr Warden , acquainting me that Lord de Versely had expired very suddenly , on his return from the House of Lords , of an ossification of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 16]: In my weak state this blow was too much for me , and I fainted .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 28]: How long I remained in that state I can not say ; but when I came to my senses I found myself still down in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 26]: I rallied as well as I could , but it was some time before I could take up the letter again , and finish it .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 56]: He stated that his lordship had left me all his personal property , which was all that he could leave -- that the library and wines were of some value , and that there would be about a thousand pounds left at the banker 's , when the funeral expenses and debts had been paid .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 12]: if he could but have left me his family name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 10]: I cried , `` it was all I coveted .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 3]: My father !
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 4]: my kind father !
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 14]: I may really say who will lament your loss as I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 49]: I threw myself on the pillow of the sofa , and for a long while shed bitter tears , not unmixed , I must own ; for my grief at his death was increased by my disappointment in having for ever lost the great object of my wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 20]: The lieutenant of the cutter came down into the cabin , and I was compelled to hide my emotion .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 36]: I complained of headache and weakness , and , collecting the letters , I again lay down in the standing bed-place , and , drawing the curtains , I was left to my own reflections .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 10]: But there was a sad tumult in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 13]: I could not keep my ideas upon one subject for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 21]: I was feverish and excited , and at last my head was so painful that I could think no more .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 20]: Fortunately exhaustion threw me again into a sound sleep , and I did not wake till the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 16]: When I did , I had to recollect where I was and what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 18]: I knew that there was something dreadful which had occurred ; again it flashed into my memory .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 6]: Lord de Versely was dead .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 10]: I groaned , and fell back on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 10]: `` Are you very ill , Captain Keene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 7]: said a voice close to me .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 19]: I opened the curtains , and perceived that it was Cross , who was standing by my bedside .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 16]: `` I am indeed , Cross , very ill ; I have very bad news .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 7]: Lord de Versely is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 23]: `` That is bad news , sir , '' replied Cross -- `` very bad news , worse than losing the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 16]: But , Captain Keene , we must have our ups and downs in this world .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 20]: You have had a long run of good fortune , and you must not be surprised at a change .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 34]: It is hard to lose your frigate and your father at the same time -- but you have not lost your life , which is a great mercy to be thankful for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 12]: I turned away , for my heart was full of bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 36]: Cross , perceiving my mood , left me , and I remained in a state of some indifference , never rising from the bed-place during the remainder of the time that I was on board .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 34]: On the second day we arrived at Heligoland , and I was requested by the governor to take up my quarters with him , until an opportunity occurred for my return to England .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 16]: My spirits were , however , so much weighed down that I could not rally .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 32]: I brooded over my misfortunes , and I thought that the time was now come when I was to meet a reverse of the prosperity which I had so long enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 30]: The sudden death of Lord de Versely , at the age of fifty-six , left me without a patron , and had destroyed all my hopes centred in him .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 16]: The object of my ambition was , I considered , for ever lost to me .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 16]: There was now no chance of my being acknowledged as a member of his family .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 17]: Then the loss of so fine a frigate , and such a noble ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 43]: That I should be honourably acquitted by a court-martial I had not a doubt ; but I had no chance of future employment ; for , now that Lord de Versely was dead , I had no one to support my claims .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 22]: My prospects , therefore , in the service were all gone , as well as the visions I had indulged in .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 40]: I dwelt with some pleasure upon the idea that Lord de Versely had left me his personal property -- it proved his regard ; but I wanted his family name , and I preferred that to thousands per annum .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 13]: The second day after our arrival Cross called , and was admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 16]: He found me in bad spirits , and tried all he could to rouse me .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 70]: At last he said , `` As for the loss of the frigate , Captain Keene , no human endeavour could have saved her , and no one could have done his duty better than you did , as the court-martial will prove ; but sir , I think it would be proper just now to show that your zeal for the service is as strong as ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 12]: `` And how am I to do that , Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 38]: `` Why , sir , you know as well as we all do how the Frenchmen are going to the wall ; that they have been thrashed out of Russia , and that they are retreating everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 60]: They say that they have left Hamburg , and I understand that the gun-brigs here are going on an expedition from this island , either to-morrow or next day , to storm the batteries of Cuxhaven , and so create a diversion , as they call it -- and very good diversion it is -- licking those French rascals .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 39]: Now , Captain Keene , if I may take the liberty of saying so , would it not be as well to take as many of your men as are able to go and join the storming party ?
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 15]: Much better than sitting here all day , melancholy , and doing nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 21]: `` It 's the first I 've heard of it , Cross ; are you sure you are correct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 17]: `` How should you hear it , sir , shut up here , and seeing nobody ?
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 28]: It 's true enough , sir ; they were telling off the men as I came up , and I think they start at daylight to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 27]: `` Well , Cross , I will think of it , and let you know my decision if you call here in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 20]: Cross left me , and I was still undecided , when the governor called to pay me a visit .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 26]: After the first exchange of civilities , I asked him if the report was true that there was an expedition about to proceed to Cuxhaven .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 57]: His reply was that the Russians had entered Hamburg , which the French had evacuated on the 11th , and that the French garrisons at Cuxhaven were reported to be in a very distressed state , and , in consequence , the Blazer , and another gun-brig , were about to proceed to attack the forts .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 2]: Hamburg !
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 14]: thought I ; why , Minnie Vanderwelt is at Hamburg with her father .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 13]: I will go and try if I can not get to Hamburg .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 17]: The remembrance of Minnie gave a spur to my energies , and created a new stimulus .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 29]: I then told the governor that I had a few men doing nothing ; that I would join them to the expedition , and serve as a volunteer .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 38]: The governor thanked me for my zeal , and I left him to go down and communicate my intentions to the commanding officer of the gun-brig , who expressed himself most happy at my assistance and co-operation .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 30]: As neither my men nor I had any luggage to hamper us -- for we had just the clothes we stood in -- we were not long getting ready .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 45]: We started next morning ; and on entering the river , found that the French had destroyed their flotilla , and soon afterwards we were invited by the people to come on shore and take possession of the batteries which the French had evacuated .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 26]: I remained with Cross and my men on shore at Cuxhaven , while the brigs went up the river , in pursuit of a privateer .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 33]: After a day or two , tired of inactivity , and anxious to arrive at Hamburg , I proposed to Cross that he should accompany me , which he cheerfully acceded to .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 26]: I had drawn a bill at Heligoland , so that we were in no want of money , and we set off on our expedition .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 44]: We had not , however , proceeded far before we were informed that the road to Hamburg was so full of French troops , scattered about , that it would be impossible to gain the city without we made a _ detour _ .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 39]: As we knew that our throats would be cut by these disorganised parties , we followed the advice given to us , walking from village to village , until we had put Hamburg between us and the river .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 25]: But when there , we found that we could not approach the imperial city , but were obliged to direct our steps more inland .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 59]: At last , we heard that the inhabitants of the town of Lunenburg had risen , and driven out the French garrison , and I resolved to proceed there , as it was more advisable than being continually in danger of being picked up by the French stragglers , who were committing every enormity that could be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 72]: We arrived safe ; stated who we were to the authorities , and were well received ; but we had not been there more than two days , when the rejoicings and braggings of the town 's - people , on account of the late victory over the French garrison , were turned to consternation by the intelligence that General Moraud was advancing with a considerable force to re-take the town .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 49]: The panic was so great , that all idea of defence was in vain ; and at the very time that I was entreating them to make a stand , the French troops poured in , and two cuirassiers galloped up , and seized upon Cross and me .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 22]: A few minutes afterwards , General Moraud came up , and inquired , in a rough tone , who we were .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 11]: I replied in French , that we were English officers .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 28]: `` Take them away , '' said he , `` and secure them well ; I 'll make an example here that sha n't be forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 16]: We were taken to the guard-room , where we remained shut up for the night .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 12]: The next morning one of the cuirassiers looked into our cell .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 12]: I asked him whether we could not have something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 8]: `` Cela ne vaut pas la peine .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 20]: Mon ami , vous n'aurez pas le temps pour la digestion ; dans une demie-heure vous serez fusilles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 13]: `` May I ask the English of that , Captain Keene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 3]: replied Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 8]: `` Yes , it is very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 22]: He says that it 's not worth while eating anything , as we shall be shot in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 20]: `` Well , I suppose they 'll shoot us first , and try us afterwards , '' replied Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 10]: `` Wo n't they give us a reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 7]: `` I suspect not , Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 23]: I am sorry that I have got you into this scrape ; as for myself , I care little about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 38]: `` I am sorry for poor Jane , sir , '' replied Cross ; `` but we all owe Heaven a death ; and , after all , it 's not worth making a fuss about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 23]: Our conversation was here interrupted by a party of French soldiers , who opened the door and ordered us to follow them .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 45]: We had not far to go , for we were led out to the Grand Place , before the prison , where we found the French troops drawn up , and General Moraud , with his officers round him , standing in the centre .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 58]: At twenty yards ' distance , and surrounded by the troops , which did not amount to more than three hundred , were thirty of the principal inhabitants of the town , pinioned , and handkerchiefs tied over their eyes , preparatory to their being shot ; this being the terrible example that the governor had threatened .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 23]: `` Look , Cross , '' said I , `` what a handful of men these Frenchmen have retaken the town with .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 15]: Why , if we had resisted , we might have laughed at them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 16]: `` They wo n't laugh any more , I expect , '' replied Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 11]: _ Allons _ , '' said the corporal to me .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 28]: replied I. `` To your friends , there , '' replied he , pointing to the town 's - people , who were about to be shot .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 15]: `` I wish to speak to the general , '' replied I , resisting .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 10]: `` No , no : you must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 28]: `` I will speak to the general , '' replied I , pushing the corporal on one side , and walking to where the general was standing .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 10]: `` Well , '' said the general , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 23]: `` I wish to know , sir , '' replied I , `` by what law you are guided in shooting us .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 25]: We are English officers , here on duty to assist against the French , and at the most can only be prisoners of war .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 12]: Upon what grounds do you order us to be shot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 9]: `` As spies , '' replied the general .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 51]: `` I am no spy , sir ; I am a post-captain in the English navy , who joined with the seamen saved from the wreck of my frigate in the attack upon Cuxhaven , and there is my boatswain , who came up with me to go to Hamburg .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 32]: At all events , I am fully justified in siding against the French : and to shoot us will be a murder , which will not fail to be revenged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 25]: `` You may pass yourself off as the captain of a frigate , but your dress disproves it , and I have better information .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 16]: You are two spies , and smugglers , and therefore you will be shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 49]: `` I tell you before all your officers that I am Captain Keene , of the Circe frigate , belonging to His Britannic Majesty , and no spy ; if you choose to shoot me now , I leave my death to be revenged by my country . ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 17]: At this moment an officer in naval uniform stepped forward and looked me in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 42]: `` General Moraud , '' said he , `` what that officer says is true : he is Captain Keene , and I was prisoner on board of his vessel ; and I also know the other man as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 16]: `` Captain Vangilt , I do not request your interference , '' replied the general .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 42]: `` But general , as an officer in the marine of the emperor , it is my duty to state to you , that you are deceived , and that this officer is the person that he states himself to be .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 43]: Messieurs , '' continued Captain Vangilt , addressing those about the general , `` I assure you it is true , and I am under the greatest obligation to this officer for his kindness and humanity when I was his prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 23]: `` I recognise you now , Mr Vangilt , '' replied I ; `` and I thank you for your evidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 23]: `` You see , general , he knows me by name : I must demand the life of this British officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 45]: The other officers then spoke to the general , who heard all they had to say , and then , with a sardonic grin , replied , -- `` Gentlemen , he may be an officer , but still he is a spy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 22]: At that moment an orderly came up on horseback , and , dismounting , gave a note to the general . ''
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 6]: _ Sacre bleu _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 15]: cried he ; `` then we 'll have our revenge first at all events .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 19]: Soldiers , take these two men , and put them in the centre , with the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 26]: Vangilt pleaded and entreated in vain : at last , in his rage , he called the general `` a coward and a madman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 29]: `` Captain Vangilt , you will answer that at some other time , '' replied the general ; `` at present we will carry our will into execution .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 5]: Lead them away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 20]: Vangilt then covered his face with his hands , and all the other officers showed signs of great disgust .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 31]: `` Farewell , Vangilt , '' said I in French ; `` I thank you for your interference , although you have not succeeded with the _ scoundrel _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 6]: `` Take them away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 4]: roared the general .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 13]: At that moment the report of musketry was heard in dropping shots .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 16]: `` Well , if ever I saw such a bloody villain , '' said Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 22]: `` Take that , at all events ; '' continued Bob , shying his hat right into the general 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 14]: `` I only wish it was a 32-pounder , you murdering thief . ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 10]: The rage of the general may easily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 36]: Once more he gave his orders , drawing his sword in a menacing way at his own soldiers , who now forced us towards the part of the square where the other victims were collected .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 32]: As soon as we were there , they wanted to blind our eyes , but that both I and Bob positively refused , and a delay was created by our resistance .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 30]: The musketry was now approaching much nearer ; and a few seconds afterwards the general gave the order for the party to advance who were to execute the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 75]: The other prisoners kneeled down ; but I and Cross would not ; and while we were resisting , the general repeated his order to fire ; but the men were confused with the advance of the enemy , and the impossibility to fire while Cross and I not only resisted the soldiers , but held them so fast , that had the party fired they must have shot them as well as us .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 22]: A cry `` To arms '' was given , and the troops all wheeled round in front to repel the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 46]: A loud hurrah was followed by an inpouring of some hundred Cossacks , with their long spears who , in a few seconds charged and routed the French , who retreated in the greatest confusion by the different streets which led into the Grand Place .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 20]: we are saved , '' cried Cross , snatching up a musket that had been dropped by a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 24]: I did the same , and pursued the retreating French , till a bullet through my leg put a stop to my progress .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 28]: I called to Cross , who came to my assistance , and he helped me back to the Grand Place , which was now clear of troops .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 29]: The Cossacks having divided , and gone in pursuit of the French , I pointed out to Cross a hotel , and requested him to help me there .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 26]: As we crossed the square , strewed with the dead and wounded , we passed close to General Moraud , who was breathing his last .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 14]: `` See , Cross , '' said I , `` there is retribution .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 12]: He intended that we should fall where he now lies . ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 20]: The general recognised us , gave a heavy groan , and , turning on his back , fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 31]: As soon as I gained the hotel , I was taken up into a room , and made as comfortable as I could be until my wound could be dressed .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 16]: `` We 're well out of it this time , sir , '' said Cross .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 25]: `` Yes , indeed , Bob ; this has indeed been a miraculous preservation , and we ought to thank Heaven for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 21]: `` Why , Captain Keene , I thought just now you did not care whether you lived or died . ''
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 52]: `` No more I did at that time , Cross ; but when we are so wonderfully preserved , we can not think but that we are preserved for better things ; and as Providence has interfered , it points out to us that it is our duty to live . ''
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 14]: `` Well , I 'm glad to hear you say that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 8]: There 's all the troops coming back .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 15]: What queer-looking chaps they are , with their long lances and long beards ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 12]: `` Yes ; they are Cossacks -- Russian irregular cavalry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 16]: `` Irregular enough I do n't doubt ; but they spitted the French men nicely .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 14]: They look exactly what I thought the Pope of Rome was like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 18]: `` Cross , call the master of the hotel , and tell him to come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 29]: When the man came , I desired him to let the commander of the allied troops know that an English captain was wounded , and required surgical assistance .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 43]: The master of the hotel went to the burgomaster , who was one of those who had been ordered to be shot ; and the burgomaster , who was now in company with the Russian commander , made known what I required .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 14]: In about an hour a surgeon came , and my wound was dressed .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 13]: The burgomaster called soon afterwards , and expressed his obligation to me .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 36]: `` For , '' said he , `` if you had not created the delay -- which you did by your resistance -- it would have been all over with us by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 48]: `` You have to thank a Dutch naval officer of the name of Vangilt , '' replied I ; `` it is he who saved us all ; and if he is not hurt , you must be kind to him , and bring him to me .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 13]: I will get him his parole , if he is a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 9]: Will you see to it , burgomaster ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 36]: `` I will , '' replied he , `` as soon as we are a little more tranquil ; but , what with fright and confusion , none of us know what we are about .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 13]: You were right , sir , in persuading us to defend ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 25]: We might easily have beaten off the small force of General Moraud ; but we thought he had ten thousand men , at least .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 18]: We will do better another time ; but the French are now in full retreat everywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 43]: That night , after dusk , Captain Vangilt came into my room : he had been a prisoner ; but the burgomaster made inquiries , and let him out , which , as chief magistrate , he had the power to do .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 26]: Vangilt embraced me with much warmth , and expressed his regret that he could not persuade that wretch , Moraud , from his murderous intentions .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 10]: `` It came to the same thing , Vangilt .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 22]: I owe you my life ; for if you had not created the delay , we should have been shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 9]: `` That 's true , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 33]: `` How fortunate it was , that , as my squadron of gun-boats were destroyed , I consented to join Moraud with what men I could collect , to surprise the town .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 6]: Are you badly wounded ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 24]: `` No , not seriously , I believe ; I hope to be able to get to Hamburg in a few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 16]: `` There is more than one there who will be delighted to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 9]: `` Is Mr Vanderwelt alive and well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 16]: `` Oh yes ; and Minnie , my pretty cousin , is still unmarried . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 8]: Vangilt smiled as he made this reply .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 21]: `` I must ask for your parole , Vangilt , and then you can go to Hamburg with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 65]: `` With all my heart , '' replied he ; `` for we are tired of war , and as I am a Dutchman and not a Frenchman , I care little for the reverses we have met with ; all I hope is , that Holland may become a kingdom again , and not a French state , as it is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 22]: The next day , I was visited by the Russian commandant , who very willingly granted me the parole of Vangilt .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 31]: In a week I was well enough to travel by slow journeys to Hamburg , lying on mattresses in a small covered waggon , and escorted by Cross and Vangilt .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 55]: A few hours before my arrival , Vangilt went ahead to give notice of my coming , and on the evening of the second day I found myself in a luxurious chamber , with every comfort , in the company of Mr Vanderwelt , and with the beaming eyes of Minnie watching over me .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 10]: The report of Minnie 's beauty was fully warranted .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 37]: When she first made her appearance , the effect upon me was quite electrical : her style was radiant , and almost dazzling -- a something you did not expect to find in the human countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 42]: Their reception of me was all that I could desire ; their affection shown towards me , their anxiety about my wound , and joy at once more having me under their roof , proved that I had not been forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 36]: After a short time , Vangilt left the room , and I remained on the sofa , one hand in the grasp of Mr Vanderwelt , the other holding the not unwilling one of Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 42]: That evening I made known to them all that had taken place since I last wrote to them , winding up with the loss of my frigate , the death of Lord de Versely , and my subsequent capture and rescue .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 21]: `` And so it was in attempting to come and see us that you were wounded and nearly murdered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 26]: `` Yes , Minnie ; I had long been anxious to see you , and could not help availing myself of the first opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 30]: `` Thank God you are here at last , '' said Mr Vanderwelt , `` and that there is now every prospect of a conclusion to the war . ''
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 17]: `` And you wo n't go to sea any more -- will you , Percival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 3]: said Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 35]: `` They wo n't give me a ship , Minnie , after having lost the one I commanded ; to be unfortunate is to be guilty , in those who have no interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 26]: `` I 'm very glad to hear it ; then you 'll remain quietly on shore , and you will come and see us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 61]: As I had been rendered feverish by travelling , and my wound was a little angry , as soon as it was dressed for the night , they left me to repose ; but that I could not -- the form of Minnie haunted me ; to sleep was impossible , and I lay thinking of her till day dawned .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 28]: The fact was , that I was for the first time in love , and that in no small degree -- before morning I was desperately so .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 42]: Indeed , there was excuse sufficient , for Minnie was as winning in her manners as she was lovely in her person , and I was not at all surprised at hearing from Vangilt of the numerous suitors for her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 55]: The next morning I was pale and feverish , which they observed with concern , Minnie was sitting by me , and Mr Vanderwelt had left the room , when she said , `` How very pale you are , and your hand is so hot ; I wish the doctor would come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 18]: `` I could not sleep last night , Minnie -- and it was all your fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 5]: `` My fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 32]: `` Yes , your fault ; for I could not sleep for thinking of you ; I thought you were looking at me as you do now the whole night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 9]: Minnie blushed , and I kissed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 31]: As soon as my wound was dressed , I requested writing materials , and wrote to the Admiralty , giving an account of what had occurred since I quitted Heligoland .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 21]: -LRB- I had written to inform them of the loss of the frigate when I was on the island -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 37]: I stated in my despatches that my wound would probably confine me for some weeks ; but as soon as I was able to be moved , I should return to England to await their orders .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 10]: I also wrote to my mother and Mr Warden .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 47]: I informed the latter of what had passed , and the delay which would be occasioned by my wound , and requested him to write to me more fully as to the death of Lord de Versely , and any other particulars which might interest me .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 35]: Having sealed these despatches , and entrusted them to the care of Mr Vanderwelt , my mind was relieved , and I had nothing to do but to think of and talk to Minnie .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 67]: That my progress in her affections was rapid , was not to be wondered at , her attachment to me having commenced so early ; and as her father was evidently pleased at our increasing intimacy , in a fortnight after my arrival at Hamburg , Minnie had consented to be mine , and her father had joined our hands , and given us his blessing .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 31]: As I now had no secrets from them , I detailed my whole history , the cause of Lord de Versely 's patronage , and the mystery of my birth .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 48]: I opened the seal-skin pouch to show them Lord de Versely 's letter to my mother , and stated what had been the object of my ambition through life , and how great was my disappointment at my hopes being overthrown by the death of his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 42]: `` My dear Percival , '' said old Mr Vanderwelt , after I had concluded my narrative , `` you have been pursuing a shadow , although the pursuit has called forth all your energies , and led to your advancement .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 5]: You have the substance .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 15]: You have wealth more than sufficient , for you know how rich I am .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 40]: You have reputation , which is better than wealth , and you have now , I trust , a fair prospect of domestic happiness ; for Minnie will be as good a wife as she has been a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 8]: What , then , do you desire ?
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 3]: A name .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 5]: And what is that ?
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 25]: If you do not like your present name , from its association with your putative father of low origin , change it to mine .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 17]: You will receive the fortune of an heiress , which will fully warrant your so doing .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 16]: At all events , let not your pride stand in the way of your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 9]: We can not expect everything in this world .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 23]: You have much to be thankful to Heaven for , and you must not repine because you can not obtain all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 37]: `` I have so ardently desired it all my life ; it has been the sole object of my ambition , '' replied I , `` and I can not but severely feel the disappointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 39]: `` Granted ; but you must bear the disappointment , or rather you must forget it ; regret for what can not be obtained is not only unavailing , but , I may say , it is sinful .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 9]: You have much to thank God for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 24]: `` I have indeed , sir , '' replied I , as I kissed his daughter ; `` and I will not repine .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 23]: I will take your name when you give me Minnie , and I will think no more about that of Delmar . ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 10]: After this conversation , the subject was not renewed .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 38]: I felt too happy with Minnie 's love to care much about anything else ; my ambition melted away before it , and I looked forward to the time when I might embrace her as my own .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 36]: My wound healed rapidly ; I had been a month at Hamburg , and was able to limp about a little , when one day Cross came in with a packet of letters from England .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 128]: There was one from the Admiralty , acknowledging the receipt of my two letters , one announcing the loss of the Circe , and the other my subsequent adventures , desiring me to come home as soon as my wound would permit me , to have the cause of the loss of the Circe investigated by a court-martial ; that of course : one from my mother , thanking Heaven that I had escaped so many dangers with only a bullet in my leg , and stating her intention of going up to town to see me as soon as she heard of my arrival ; the third was a voluminous epistle from Mr Warden , which I shall give to the reader in his own words .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 43]: `` MY DEAR CAPTAIN KEENE : -- `` I received your two letters , the first , acquainting me with your miraculous preservation after the loss of your frigate , and the other with your subsequent adventures on _ terra firma _ .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 10]: You appear to me to have a charmed life !
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 26]: and as there is now every prospect of a speedy termination to this long and devastating war , I hope you will live many days .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 47]: I did not enter into many particulars as to Lord de Versely 's death , as it was so sudden ; the property left you is not perhaps of so much value in itself , as it is as a mark of his regard and esteem .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 72]: Nevertheless , if ever you sit down quietly and take a wife , you will find that it will save you a few thousands in furnishing and decorating ; the plate , pictures , and objects _ de vertu _ , as they are termed , are really valuable , and I know that you will not part with them , bequeathed as they have been by your friend and patron .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 11]: `` I must now refer to particulars of more consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 72]: You know that , as a legal adviser , my lips are supposed to be sealed , and they would have remained so now , had it not been that circumstances have occurred which warrant my disclosure ; indeed , I may say that I have permission to speak plainly , as you have to repel charges against you which , if not disproved , may seriously affect your future interests .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 80]: Know then , that when you were last at Madeline Hall , I was sent for to draw up the will of the Honourable Miss Delmar , and I then discovered that the will which had been made in favour of Lord de Versely , to whom Miss Delmar had left everything , was by his express desire to be altered in your favour ; and at the same time the secret of your birth was confided to me .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 16]: You will see , therefore , that Lord de Versely did not neglect your interests .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 20]: The de Versely property he could not leave you , but he did what he could in your favour .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 62]: This will was signed , sealed , and attested , and is now in my possession ; and as the old lady is very shakey , and something approaching to imbecile , I considered that in a short time I should have to congratulate you upon your succession to this fine property , which is a clear 8,000 pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 60]: `` You must also know , that Colonel Delmar , whom you also met here , and who accompanied you to Portsmouth , has always hoped that he would be the heir of the old lady ; and , indeed , had you not stepped in , I have no doubt but eventually such would have been the case .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 65]: It appears that he has , by some means , discovered that you have ousted him , and since you sailed he has returned to Madeline Hall , and has so unsettled the old lady , by reporting that you are an impostor , and no relation by blood , that she has given me instructions to make a new will in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 42]: By what means he has prevailed upon her I can not tell : the chief support of his assertion rests upon some letters , which he has either surreptitiously obtained or forged , written by your mother and addressed to you .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 23]: Now that your mother has been supposed to be dead many years I knew well for Lord de Versely told me so .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 59]: The old lady has shown me these letters , which certainly appear authentic ; and she says , that if you have deceived her and Lord de Versely as to your mother 's death , you have deceived them in everything else , and that she does not now believe that you are the son of her nephew .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 28]: As I hinted before , the old lady is almost in her dotage , and can not well be reasoned with , for she is very positive .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 14]: I argued as long as I could with her , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 49]: At last she consented to stop proceedings until I heard from you , saying , ` If I can have any proof under my nephew 's own hand that Percival is his son , I will be content ; but without that I sign the new will . '
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 41]: `` Such is the state of affairs , that you have little chance if such a document can not be produced , I feel certain ; at all events , I have gained delay which we lawyers always aim at .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 22]: I only wish the old lady would take a sudden departure , and leave the question as unsettled as it is .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 30]: Had Lord de Versely not been so suddenly called away , this would never have happened ; as it is , we must make the best fight we can .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 11]: At present the colonel has it all his own way .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 29]: Pray write immediately , and explain as much as you can of this strange affair and let me know what steps you think it advisable to be taken .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 10]: -- Yours very truly , `` F. WARDEN . ''
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 11]: The receipt of this letter was extremely mortifying to me .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 52]: I could not help feeling that if I lost the fine property which had been intended for me , I lost it chiefly by the deceit practised relative to my mother 's supposed death , and that if I did lose the estate in consequence , it was a proper punishment .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 18]: At the same time , I felt not a little indignant at the conduct of Colonel Delmar .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 51]: I now understood why it was that he was talking with Mr Warden 's clerk when I passed by them ; and I also felt certain that he must have taken advantage of my situation at Portsmouth , and have opened my desk and stolen the letters from my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 40]: For this I resolved to call him to account , under any circumstances -LRB- that is , whether he or I became the heir to the old lady -RRB- , as soon as I could fall in with him .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 43]: Although I was far from despising the property which I was now likely to lose , yet I was more actuated in my wish to regain it by my enmity towards him , and I immediately resolved upon what I would do .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 58]: As I was still unfit to travel , and , moreover , was resolved not to leave Hamburg without Minnie as my wife , I sent for Cross , and telling him in few words , what had taken place , asked him if he would immediately start for England , which he gladly consented to do .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 63]: `` The old lady requires , it seems , proof from Lord de Versely 's own hand that I am his son ; fortunately , that is in my power to give ; so do you take this , and as soon as you arrive in England make all haste to Mr Warden 's and put it into his own hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 24]: I then took off the seal-skin pouch containing Lord de Versely 's letter to my mother , and confided it to his care .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 49]: At the same time I wrote a long letter to Mr Warden explaining as far as I could the means which the colonel had used to get possession of the letters , and the reason which induced me to make his lordship believe that my mother was dead .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 37]: I did not attempt to extenuate my conduct ; on the contrary , I severely blamed myself for my deception , and acknowledged that if I lost the estate it was nothing more than I deserved .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 11]: Cross made all haste , and sailed the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 21]: Having put this affair in train , I had nothing to do but to give all my thoughts to Minnie .
