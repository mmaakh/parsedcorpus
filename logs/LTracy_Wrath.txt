Parsing [sent. 1 len. 19]: THE DAY OF WRATH A STORY OF 1914 BY LOUIS TRACY PREFACE This book demands no explanatory word .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 27]: But I do wish to assure the reader that every incident in its pages casting discredit on the invaders of Belgium is founded on actual fact .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 29]: I refer those who may doubt the truth of this sweeping statement to the official records published by the Governments of Great Britain , France , and Belgium .

Parsing [sent. 5 len. 21]: 264 CHAPTER I THE LAVA-STREAM `` For God 's sake , if you are an Englishman , help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 57]: That cry of despair , so subdued yet piercing in its intensity , reached Arthur Dalroy as he pressed close on the heels of an all-powerful escort in Lieutenant Karl von Halwig , of the Prussian Imperial Guard , at the ticket-barrier of the Friedrich Strasse Station on the night of Monday , 3rd August 1914 .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 24]: An officer 's uniform is a _ passe-partout _ in Germany ; the showy uniform of the Imperial Guard adds awe to authority .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 40]: It may well be doubted if any other insignia of rank could have passed a companion in civilian attire so easily through the official cordon which barred the chief railway station at Berlin that night to all unauthorised persons .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 19]: Von Halwig was in front , impartially cursing and shoving aside the crowd of police and railway men .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 34]: A gigantic ticket-inspector , catching sight of the Guardsman , bellowed an order to `` clear the way ; '' but a general officer created a momentary diversion by choosing that forbidden exit .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 37]: Von Halwig 's heels clicked , and his right hand was raised in a salute , so Dalroy was given a few seconds wherein to scrutinise the face of the terrified woman who had addressed him .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 20]: He saw that she was young , an Englishwoman , and undoubtedly a lady by her speech and garb .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 9]: `` What can I do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 11]: `` Get me into a train for the Belgian frontier .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 20]: I have plenty of money , but these idiots will not even allow me to enter the station . ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 8]: He had to decide in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 65]: He had every reason to believe that a woman friendless and alone , especially a young and good-looking one , was far safer in Berlin -- where some thousands of Britons and Americans had been caught in the lava-wave of red war now flowing unrestrained from the Danube to the North Sea -- than in the train which would start for Belgium within half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 40]: But the tearful indignation in the girl 's voice -- even her folly in describing as `` idiots '' the hectoring jacks-in-office , any one of whom might have understood her -- led impulse to triumph over saner judgment .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 4]: `` Come along !
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 3]: quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 10]: `` You 're my cousin , Evelyn Fane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 18]: With a self-control that was highly creditable , the young lady thrust a hand through his arm .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: In the other hand she carried a reticule .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 13]: The action surprised Dalroy , though feminine intuition had only displayed common-sense .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 7]: `` Have you any luggage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 7]: `` Nothing beyond this tiny bag .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 23]: It was hopeless to think of -- '' Von Halwig turned at the barrier to insure his English friend 's safe passage .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 4]: `` Hallo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 13]: Evidently he was taken aback by the unexpected addition to the party .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 14]: `` A fellow-countrywoman in distress , '' smiled Dalroy , speaking in German .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 13]: Then he added , in English , `` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 10]: As it happens , two places are reserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 17]: Von Halwig laughed in a way which the Englishman would have resented at any other moment .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: `` Excellent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 3]: he guffawed .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 7]: `` Beautifully contrived , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 11]: -- Hi , there , sheep 's - head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 16]: -- this to the ticket-inspector -- `` let that porter with the portmanteau pass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 26]: Thus did Captain Arthur Dalroy find himself inside the Friedrich Strasse Station on the night when Germany was already at war with Russia and France .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 48]: With him was the stout leather bag into which he had thrown hurriedly such few articles as were indispensable -- an ironic distinction when viewed in the light of subsequent events ; with him , too , was a charming and trustful and utterly unknown travelling companion .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 37]: Von Halwig was not only vastly amused but intensely curious ; his endeavours to scrutinise the face of a girl whom the Englishman had apparently conjured up out of the maelström of Berlin were almost rude .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 9]: They failed , however , at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 35]: Every woman knows exactly how to attract or repel a man 's admiration ; this young lady was evidently determined that only the vaguest hint of her features should be vouchsafed to the Guardsman .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 23]: A fairly large hat and a veil , assisted by the angle at which she held her head , defeated his intent .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 30]: She still clung to Dalroy 's arm , and relinquished it only when a perspiring platform-inspector , armed with a list , brought the party to a first-class carriage .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 8]: There were no sleeping-cars on the train .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 13]: Every _ wagon-lit _ in Berlin had been commandeered by the staff .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 37]: `` I have had a not-to-be-described-in-words difficulty in retaining these corner places , '' he said , whereupon Dalroy gave him a five-mark piece , and the girl was installed in the seat facing the engine .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 8]: The platform-inspector had not exaggerated his services .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 6]: The train was literally besieged .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 16]: Scores of important officials were storming at railway employés because accommodation could not be found .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 30]: Dalroy , wishful at first that Von Halwig would take himself off instead of standing near the open door and peering at the girl , soon changed his mind .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 54]: There could not be the slightest doubt that were it not for the presence of an officer of the Imperial Guard he and his `` cousin '' would have been unceremoniously bundled out on to the platform to make room for some many-syllabled functionary who `` simply must get to the front . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 18]: As for the lady , she was the sole representative of her sex travelling west that night .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 16]: Meanwhile the two young men chatted amicably , using German and English with equal ease .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 19]: `` I think you are making a mistake in going by this route , '' said Von Halwig .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 14]: `` The frontier lines will be horribly congested during the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 19]: You see , we have to be in Paris in three weeks , so we must hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 12]: `` You are very confident , '' said the Englishman pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 14]: He purposely avoided any discussion of his reasons for choosing the Cologne-Brussels-Ostend line .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 23]: As an officer of the British army , he was particularly anxious to watch the vaunted German mobilisation in its early phases .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 3]: `` Confident !
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 30]: Those wretched little _ piou-pious _ '' -- a slang term for the French infantry -- `` will run long before they see the whites of our eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 33]: `` I have n't met any French regiments since I was a youngster ; but I believe France is far better organised now than in 1870 , '' was the noncommittal reply .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 12]: Von Halwig threw out his right arm in a wide sweep .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 13]: `` We shall brush them aside -- so , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 15]: `` The German army was strong in those days ; now it is irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 7]: _ You _ are a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 5]: You _ know _ .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 12]: To-night 's papers say England is wavering between peace and war .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 10]: But I have no doubt she will be wise .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 14]: That Channel is a great asset , a great safeguard , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 6]: Again Dalroy changed the subject .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 17]: `` If it is a fair question , when do you start for the front ? ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 10]: `` To-morrow , at six in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 14]: `` How very kind of you to spare such valuable time now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 5]: `` Not at all !
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 4]: Everything is ready .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: Germany is always ready .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 20]: The Emperor says ` Mobilise , ' and , behold , we cross the frontier within the hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 12]: `` War is a rotten business , '' commented Dalroy thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 32]: `` I 've seen something of it in India , where , when all is said and done , a scrap in the hills brings the fighting men alone into line .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 14]: But I 'm sorry for the unfortunate peasants and townspeople who will suffer .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 8]: What of Belgium , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 5]: _ Les braves Belges !
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 6]: _ '' laughed the other .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 9]: `` They will do as we tell them .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 5]: What else is possible ?
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 18]: To adapt one of your own proverbs : ` Needs must when the German drives ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 14]: Dalroy understood quite well that Von Halwig 's bumptious tone was not assumed .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 8]: The Prussian Junker could hardly think otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 30]: But the glances cast by the Guardsman at the silent figure seated near the window showed that some part of his vapouring was meant to impress the feminine heart .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 31]: A gallant figure he cut , too , as he stood there , caressing his Kaiser-fashioned moustaches with one hand while the other rested on the hilt of his sword .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 26]: He was tall , fully six feet , and , according to Dalroy 's standard of physical fitness , at least a stone too heavy .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 46]: The personification of Nietzsche 's Teutonic `` overman , '' the `` big blonde brute '' who is the German military ideal , Dalroy classed him , in the expressive phrase of the regimental mess , as `` a good bit of a bounder . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 40]: Yet he was a patrician by birth , or he could not hold a commission in the Imperial Guard , and he had been most helpful and painstaking that night , so perforce one must be civil to him .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 30]: Dalroy himself , nearly as tall , was lean and lithe , hard as nails , yet intellectual , a cavalry officer who had passed through the Oxford mint .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 19]: By this time four other occupants of the compartment were in evidence , and a ticket-examiner came along .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 7]: Dalroy produced a number of vouchers .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 34]: The girl , who obviously spoke German , leaned out , purse in hand , and was about to explain that the crush in the booking-hall had prevented her from obtaining a ticket .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 4]: But Dalroy intervened .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: `` I have your ticket , '' he said , announcing a singular fact in the most casual manner he could command .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 16]: `` Thank you , '' she said instantly , trying to conceal her own surprise .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 27]: But her eyes met Von Halwig 's bold stare , and read therein not only a ready appraisement of her good looks but a perplexed half-recognition .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: The railwayman raised a question .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 18]: Contrary to the general custom , the vouchers bore names , which he compared with a list .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 22]: `` These tickets are for Herren Fane and Dalroy , and I find a lady here , '' he said suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: `` Fräulein Evelyn Fane , my cousin , '' explained Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: `` A mistake of the issuing office . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 10]: `` But -- '' '' _ Ach , was !
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 8]: _ '' broke in Von Halwig impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 4]: `` You hear .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 5]: Some fool has blundered .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 5]: It is sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 8]: At any rate , his word sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 13]: Dalroy entered the carriage , and the door was closed and locked .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 17]: `` Never say I have n't done you a good turn , '' grinned the Prussian .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 13]: `` A pleasant journey , though it may be a slow one .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 13]: Do n't be surprised if I am in Aachen before you . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 4]: Then he coloured .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: He had said too much .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 13]: One of the men in the compartment gave him a sharp glance .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 21]: Aachen , better known to travelling Britons as Aix-la-Chapelle , lay on the road to Belgium , not to France .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 9]: `` Well , to our next meeting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 5]: he went on boisterously .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 10]: `` Run across to Paris during the occupation . ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: `` Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 16]: And accept my very grateful thanks , '' said Dalroy , and the train started .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 25]: `` I can not tell you how much obliged I am , '' said a sweet voice as he settled down into his seat .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 18]: `` Please , may I pay you now for the ticket which you supplied so miraculously ? ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 15]: `` No miracle , but a piece of rare good-luck , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 40]: `` One of the attachés at our Embassy arranged to travel to England to-night , or I would never have got away , even with the support of the State Councillor who requested Lieutenant von Halwig to befriend me .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 12]: Then , at the last moment , Fane could n't come .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 18]: I meant asking Von Halwig to send a messenger to the Embassy with the spare ticket . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 23]: `` So you will forward the money to Mr. Fane with my compliments , '' said the girl , opening her purse .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 3]: Dalroy agreed .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 10]: There was no other way out of the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 18]: Incidentally , he could not help noticing that the lady was well supplied with gold and notes .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 25]: As they were fellow-travellers by force of circumstances , Dalroy took a card from the pocket-book in which he was securing a one-hundred-mark note .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 25]: `` We have a long journey before us , and may as well get to know each other by name , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 5]: The girl smiled acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 18]: She read , `` Captain Arthur Dalroy , 2nd Bengal Lancers , Junior United Service Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 34]: `` I have n't a card in my bag , '' she said simply , `` but my name is Beresford -- Irene Beresford -- Miss Beresford , '' and she coloured prettily .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 39]: `` I have made an effort of the explanation , '' she went on ; `` but I think it is stupid of women not to let people know at once whether they are married or single . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: `` I 'll be equally candid , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 12]: `` I 'm not married , nor likely to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: `` Is that defiance , or merely self-defence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 3]: `` Neither .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 4]: A bald fact .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 16]: I hold with Kitchener that a soldier should devote himself exclusively to his profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 46]: `` It would certainly be well for many a heart-broken woman in Europe to-day if all soldiers shared your opinion , '' was the answer ; and Dalroy knew that his _ vis-à-vis _ had deftly guided their chatter on to a more sedate plane .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 16]: The train halted an unconscionable time at a suburban station , and again at Charlottenburg .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 26]: The four Germans in the compartment , all Prussian officers , commented on the delay , and one of them made a joke of it .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 14]: `` The signals must be against us at Liège , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 20]: `` Perhaps England has sent a regiment of Territorials across by the Ostend boat , '' chimed in another .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 15]: Then he turned to Dalroy , and said civilly , `` You are English .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 18]: Your country will not be so mad as to join in this adventure , will she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 21]: `` This is a war of diplomats , '' said Dalroy , resolved to keep a guard on his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 14]: `` I am quite sure that no one in England wants war . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 11]: `` But will England fight if Germany invades Belgium ? ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 9]: `` Surely Germany will do no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 10]: The integrity of Belgium is guaranteed by treaty . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 21]: `` Your friend the lieutenant , then , did not tell you that our army crossed the frontier to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 6]: `` Is that possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 6]: It is no secret now .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 17]: Did n't you realise what he meant when he said his regiment was going to Aachen ?
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 7]: But , what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 5]: Belgium can not resist .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 9]: She must give free passage to our troops .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 14]: She will protest , of course , just to save her face . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 8]: The talk became general among the men .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 19]: At the moment there was a fixed belief in Germany that Britain would stand aloof from the quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 27]: So convinced was Austria of the British attitude that the Viennese mob gathered outside the English ambassador 's residence that same evening , and cheered enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 38]: During another long wait Dalroy took advantage of the clamour and bustle of a crowded platform to say to Miss Beresford in a low tone , `` Are you well advised to proceed _ viâ _ Brussels ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 16]: Why not branch off at Oberhausen , and go home by way of Flushing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 14]: `` I must meet my sister in Brussels , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 12]: `` She is younger than I , and at school there .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 7]: I am not afraid -- now .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 15]: They will not interfere with any one in this train , especially a woman .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 5]: But how about you ?
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 11]: You have the unmistakable look of a British officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 5]: `` Have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 5]: he said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 14]: `` That is just why I am going through , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 11]: Neither could guess the immense significance of those few words .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 14]: There was a reasonable chance of escape through Holland during the next day .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 19]: By remaining in the Belgium-bound train they were , all unknowing , entering the crater of a volcano .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 12]: The ten-hours ' run to Cologne was drawn out to twenty .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 17]: Time and again they were shunted into sidings to make way for troop trains and supplies .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 23]: At a wayside station a bright moon enabled Dalroy to take stock of two monster howitzers mounted on specially constructed bogie trucks .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 23]: He estimated their bore at sixteen or seventeen inches ; the fittings and accessories of each gun filled nine or ten trucks .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 5]: How prepared Germany was !
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 5]: How thorough her organisation !
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 16]: Yet the hurrying forward of these giant siege-guns was premature , to put it mildly ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 28]: Or were the German generals really convinced that they would sweep every obstacle from their path , and hammer their way into Paris on a fixed date ?
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 24]: Dalroy thought of England , and sighed , because his mind turned first to the army -- barely one hundred thousand trained men .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 14]: Then he remembered the British fleet , and the outlook was more reassuring !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 14]: After a night of fitful sleep dawn found the travellers not yet half-way .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 6]: The four Germans were furious .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 31]: They held staff appointments , and had been assured in Berlin that the clock-work regularity of mobilisation arrangements would permit this particular train to cover the journey according to schedule .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 6]: Meals were irregular and scanty .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 27]: At one small town , in the early morning , Dalroy secured a quantity of rolls and fruit , and all benefited later by his forethought .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 15]: Newspapers bought _ en route _ contained dark forebodings of England 's growing hostility .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 27]: A special edition of a Hanover journal spoke of an ultimatum , a word which evoked harsh denunciations of `` British treachery '' from the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 15]: The comparative friendliness induced by Dalroy 's prevision as a caterer vanished at once .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 32]: When the train rolled wearily across the Rhine into Cologne , ten hours late , both Dalroy and the girl were fully aware that their fellow-passengers regarded them as potential enemies .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 27]: It was then about six o'clock on the Tuesday evening , and a loud-voiced official announced that the train would not proceed to Aix-la-Chapelle until eight .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 39]: The German officers went out , no doubt to seek a meal ; but took the precaution of asking an officer in charge of some Bavarian troops on the platform to station a sentry at the carriage door .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 48]: Probably they had no other intent , and merely wished to safeguard their places ; but Dalroy realised now the imprudence of talking English , and signed to the girl that she was to come with him into the corridor on the opposite side of the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 5]: There they held counsel .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 15]: Miss Beresford was firmly resolved to reach Brussels , and flinched from no difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 19]: It must be remembered that war was not formally declared between Great Britain and Germany until that evening .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 20]: Indeed , the tremendous decision was made while the pair so curiously allied by fate were discussing their programme .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 23]: Had they even quitted the train at Cologne they had a fair prospect of reaching neutral territory by hook or by crook .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 20]: But they knew nothing of Liège , and the imperishable laurels which that gallant city was about to gather .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 6]: They elected to go on !
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 17]: A station employé brought them some unpalatable food , which they made a pretence of eating .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 30]: Irene Beresford 's Hanoverian German was perfect , so Dalroy did not air his less accurate accent , and the presence of the sentry was helpful at this crisis .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 11]: Though sharp-eyed and rabbit-eared , the man was quite civil .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 7]: At last the Prussian officers returned .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 13]: He who had been chatty overnight was now brusque , even overbearing .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: `` You have no right here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: he vociferated at Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 10]: `` Why should a damned Englishman travel with Germans ?
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 7]: Your country is perfidious as ever .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 12]: How do I know that you are not a spy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 17]: `` Spies are not vouched for by Councillors of State , '' was the calm reply .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 34]: `` I have in my pocket a letter from his Excellency Staatsrath von Auschenbaum authorising my journey , and you yourself must perceive that I am escorting a lady to her home . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 10]: The other snorted , but subsided into his seat .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 13]: Not yet had Teutonic hatred of all things British burst its barriers .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 6]: But the pressure was increasing .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 21]: Soon it would leap forth like the pent-up flood of some mighty reservoir whose retaining wall had crumbled into ruin .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 7]: `` Is there any news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 5]: went on Dalroy civilly .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 22]: At any hazard , he was determined , for the sake of the girl , to maintain the semblance of good-fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 10]: She , he saw , was cool and collected .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 9]: Evidently , she had complete trust in him .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 8]: For a little while no one answered .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 23]: Ultimately , the officer who regarded Liège as a joke said shortly , `` Your Sir Grey has made some impudent suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 21]: I suppose it is what the Americans call ` bluff ' ; but bluffing Germany is a dangerous game . ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 10]: `` Newspapers exaggerate such matters , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 6]: `` It may be so .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 18]: Still , you 'll be lucky if you get beyond Aachen , '' was the ungracious retort .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 11]: The speaker refused to give the town its French name .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 18]: An hour passed , the third in Cologne , before the train rumbled away into the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: The girl pretended to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 8]: Indeed , she may have dozed fitfully .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 10]: Dalroy did not attempt to engage her in talk .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 7]: The Germans gossiped in low tones .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 12]: They knew that their nation had spied on the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 17]: Naturally , they held every foreigner in their midst as tainted in the same vile way .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 12]: From Cologne to Aix-la-Chapelle is only a two hours ' run .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 7]: That night the journey consumed four .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 14]: Dalroy no longer dared look out when the train stood in a siding .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 41]: He knew by the sounds that all the dread paraphernalia of war was speeding toward the frontier ; but any display of interest on his part would be positively dangerous now ; so he , too , closed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 33]: By this time he was well aware that his real trials would begin at Aix ; but he had the philosopher 's temperament , and never leaped fences till he reached them .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 17]: At one in the morning they entered the station of the last important town in Germany .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 12]: Holland lay barely three miles away , Belgium a little farther .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 5]: The goal was near .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 17]: Dalroy felt that by calmness and quiet determination he and his charming protégé might win through .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 9]: He was very much taken by Irene Beresford .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 12]: He had never met any girl who attracted him so strongly .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 19]: He found himself wondering whether he might contrive to cultivate this strangely formed friendship when they reached England .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 19]: In a word , the self-denying ordinance popularly attributed to Lord Kitchener was weakening in Captain Arthur Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 10]: Then his sky dropped , dropped with a bang .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 22]: The train had not quite halted when the door was torn open , and a bespectacled , red-faced officer glared in .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 18]: `` It is reported from Cologne that there are English in this carriage , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 6]: `` Correct , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 5]: There they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 10]: said the man who had snarled at Dalroy earlier .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 10]: `` You must descend , '' commanded the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 8]: `` You are both under arrest . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 6]: `` On what charge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 19]: inquired Dalroy , bitterly conscious of a gasp of terror which came involuntarily from the girl 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 5]: `` You are spies .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 18]: A sentry heard you talking English , and saw you examining troop-trains from the carriage window . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 25]: So that Bavarian lout had listened to the Prussian officer 's taunt , and made a story of his discovery to prove his diligence .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 20]: `` We are not spies , nor have we done anything to warrant suspicion , '' said Dalroy quietly .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 10]: `` I have letters -- '' `` No talk .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 5]: Out you come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 18]: and he was dragged forth by a bloated fellow whom he could have broken with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 30]: It was folly to resist , so he merely contrived to keep on his feet , whereas the fat bully meant to trip him ignominiously on to the platform .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 5]: `` Now you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: was the order to Irene , and she followed .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 5]: Half-a-dozen soldiers closed around .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 14]: There could be no doubting that preparations had been made for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 8]: `` May I have my portmanteau ? ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 3]: said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 17]: `` You are acting in error , as I shall prove when given an opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 29]: `` Shut your mouth , you damned Englishman '' -- that was a favourite phrase on German lips apparently -- `` would you dare to argue with me ?
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 11]: -- Here , one of you , take his bag .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 6]: Has the woman any baggage ?
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 25]: Then march them to the -- '' A tall young lieutenant , in the uniform of the Prussian Imperial Guard , dashed up breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 12]: `` Ah , I was told the train had arrived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 23]: `` Yes , I am in search of those two -- '' `` Thank goodness you are here , Von Halwig ! ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 3]: began Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 11]: The Guardsman turned on him a face aflame with fury .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 4]: `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 10]: `` I 'll soon settle _ your _ affair .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 33]: -- Take his papers and money , and put him in a waiting-room till I return , '' he added , speaking to the officer of reserves who had affected the arrest .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 13]: `` Place the lady in another waiting-room , and lock her in .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 9]: I 'll see that she is not molested .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 18]: As for this English _ schwein-hund _ , shoot him at the least sign of resistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 33]: `` But , Herr Lieutenant , '' began the other , whose heavy paunch was a measure of his self-importance , `` I have orders -- '' '' _ Ach , was !
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 4]: _ I know !
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 8]: This Englishman is not an ordinary spy .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 12]: He is a cavalry captain , and speaks our language fluently .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: Do as I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 7]: I shall come back in half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: -- Fräulein , you are in safer hands .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: You , I fancy , will be well treated . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: Dalroy said not a word .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 17]: He saw at once that some virus had changed Von Halwig 's urbanity to bitter hatred .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 24]: He was sure the Guardsman had been drinking , but that fact alone would not account for such an amazing _ volte-face _ .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 13]: Could it be that Britain had thrown in her lot with France ?
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 14]: In his heart of hearts he hoped passionately that the rumour was true .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 22]: And he blazed , too , into a fierce if silent resentment of the Prussian 's satyr-like smile at Irene Beresford .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 6]: But what could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 6]: Protest was worse than useless .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 14]: He felt that he would be shot or bayoneted on the slightest pretext .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 13]: Von Halwig evidently resented the presence of a crowd of gaping onlookers .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 6]: `` No more talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 4]: he ordered sharply .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 13]: `` Do as I bid you , Herr Lieutenant of Reserves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 5]: `` Captain Dalroy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 19]: cried the girl in a voice of utter dismay , `` do n't let them part us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: Von Halwig pointed to a door .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 7]: `` In there with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 9]: he growled , and Dalroy was hustled away .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 13]: Irene screamed , and tried to avoid the Prussian 's outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 5]: He grasped her determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 8]: `` Do n't be a fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: he hissed in English . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 7]: _ I _ can save you .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 5]: He is done with .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 12]: A firing-party or a rope will account for him at daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 8]: calm yourself , _ gnädiges Fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 9]: There are consolations , even in war . ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 36]: Dalroy contrived , out of the tail of his eye , to see that the distraught girl was led toward a ladies ' waiting-room , two doors from the apartment into which he was thrust .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 37]: There he was searched by the lieutenant of reserves , not skilfully , because the man missed nearly the whole of his money , which he carried in a pocket in the lining of his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 19]: All else was taken -- tickets , papers , loose cash , even a cigarette-case and favourite pipe .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 15]: The instructions to the sentry were emphatic : `` Do n't close the door !
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 8]: Admit no one without sending for me !
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 10]: Shoot or stab the prisoner if he moves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: And the fat man bustled away .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 8]: The station was swarming with military big-wigs .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 6]: He must remain in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 9]: During five long minutes Dalroy reviewed the situation .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 9]: Probably he would be executed as a spy .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 18]: At best , he could not avoid internment in a fortress till the end of the war .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 12]: He preferred to die in a struggle for life and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 9]: Men had escaped in conditions quite as desperate .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 4]: Why not he ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 15]: The surge of impotent anger subsided in his veins , and he took thought .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 34]: Outside the open door stood the sentry , holding his rifle , with fixed bayonet , in the attitude of a sportsman who expects a covey of partridges to rise from the stubble .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 11]: A window of plain glass gave on to the platform .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 13]: Seemingly , it had not been opened since the station was built .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 17]: Three windows of frosted glass in the opposite wall were , to all appearance , practicable .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 11]: Judging by the sounds , the station square lay without .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 10]: Was there a lock and key on the door ?
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 4]: Or a bolt ?
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 9]: He could not tell from his present position .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 11]: The sentry had orders to kill him if he moved .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 10]: Perhaps the man would not interpret the command literally .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 12]: At any rate , that was a risk he must take .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 26]: With head sunk , and hands behind his back , obviously in a state of deep dejection , he began to stroll to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 8]: Well , he had a fighting chance .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 6]: He was not shot forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 16]: A slight commotion on the platform caught his eye , the sentry 's as well .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 29]: A tall young officer , wearing a silver helmet , and accompanied by a glittering staff , clanked past ; with him the lieutenant of reserves , gesticulating .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 24]: Dalroy recognised one of the Emperor 's sons ; but the sentry had probably never seen the princeling before , and was agape .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 11]: And there was not only a key but a bolt !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 15]: With three noiseless strides , Dalroy was at the door and had slammed it .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: The key turned easily , and the bolt shot home .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 18]: Then he raced to the middle window , unfastened the hasp , and raised the lower sash .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 22]: He counted on the thick-headed sentry wasting some precious seconds in trying to force the door , and he was right .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 44]: As it happened , before the man thought of looking in through the platform window Dalroy had not only lowered the other window behind him but dropped from the sill to the pavement between the wall and a covered van which stood there .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 54]: Now he was free -- free as any Briton could be deemed free in Aix-la-Chapelle at that hour , one man among three army corps , an unarmed Englishman among a bitterly hostile population which recked naught of France or Belgium or Russia , but hated England already with an almost maniacal malevolence .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 33]: And Irene Beresford , that sweet-voiced , sweet-faced English girl , was a prisoner at the mercy of a `` big blonde brute , '' a half-drunken , wholly enraged Prussian Junker .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 6]: The thought rankled and stung .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 7]: It was not to be borne .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 24]: For the first time that night Dalroy knew what fear was , and in a girl 's behalf , not in his own .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 5]: Could he save her ?
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 25]: Heaven had befriended him thus far ; would a kindly Providence clear his brain and nerve his spirit to achieve an almost impossible rescue ?
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 12]: The prayer was formless and unspoken , yet it was answered .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 37]: He had barely gathered his wits after that long drop of nearly twelve feet into the station yard before he was given a vague glimpse of a means of delivering the girl from her immediate peril .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 26]: CHAPTER II IN THE VORTEX The van , one among a score of similar vehicles , was backed against the curb of a raised path .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 37]: At the instant Dalroy quitted the window-ledge a railway employé appeared from behind another van on the left , and was clearly bewildered by seeing a well-dressed man springing from such an unusual and precarious perch .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 44]: The new-comer , a big , burly fellow , who wore a peaked and lettered cap , a blouse , baggy breeches , and sabots , and carried a lighted hand-lamp , looked what , in fact , he was -- an engine-cleaner .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 21]: In all likelihood he guessed that any one choosing such a curious exit from a waiting-room was avoiding official scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 23]: He hurried forward at once , holding the lamp above his head , because it was dark behind the row of vans .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 6]: `` Hi , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 11]: `` A word with you , _ Freiherr _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: The title , of course , was a bit of German humour .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 9]: Obviously , he was bent on investigating matters .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 5]: Dalroy did not run .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 22]: In the street without he heard the tramp of marching troops , the jolting of wagons , the clatter of horses .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 24]: He knew that a hue and cry could have only one result -- he would be pulled down by a score of hands .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 36]: Moreover , with the sight of that suspicious Teuton face , its customary boorish leer now replaced by a surly inquisitiveness , came the first glimmer of a fantastically daring way of rescuing Irene Beresford .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 6]: He advanced , smiling pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 12]: `` It 's all right , Heinrich , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 15]: `` I 've arrived by train from Berlin , and the station was crowded .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 9]: Being an acrobat , I took a bounce .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 3]: What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 8]: The engine-cleaner was not a quick-witted person .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 13]: He scowled , but allowed Dalroy to come near -- too near .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 15]: `` I believe you 're a _ verdammt _ Engl -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 47]: But the popular German description of a Briton died on his lips , because Dalroy put a good deal of science and no small leaven of brute force into a straight punch which reached that cluster of nerves known to pugilism as `` the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 19]: The German fell as though he had been pole-axed , and his thick skull rattled on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 31]: Dalroy grabbed the lamp before the oil could gush out , placed it upright on the ground , and divested the man of blouse , baggy breeches , and sabots .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 33]: Luckily , since every second was precious , he found that he was able to wedge his boots into the sabots , which he could not have kept on his feet otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 58]: His training as a soldier had taught him the exceeding value of our Fifth Henry 's advice to the British army gathered before Harfleur : In peace there 's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility ; But when the blast of war blows in our ears Then imitate the action of the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 8]: The warring tiger does not move slowly .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 48]: Half-a-minute after his would-be captor had crashed headlong to the hard cobbles of Aix-la-Chapelle , Dalroy was creeping between two wagons , completing a hasty toilet by tearing off collar and tie , and smearing his face and hands with oil and grease from lamp and cap .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 33]: Even as he went he heard a window of the waiting-room being flung open , and the excited cries which announced the discovery of a half-naked body lying beneath in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 39]: He saw now that to every van was harnessed a pair of horses , their heads deep in nose-bags , while men in the uniform of the Commissariat Corps were grouped around an officer who was reading orders .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 8]: The vans were sheeted in black tarpaulins .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 38]: With German attention to detail , their destination , contents , and particular allotment were stencilled on the covers in white paint : `` Liège , baggage and fodder , cavalry division , 7th Army Corps . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 17]: He learnt subsequently that this definite legend appeared on front and rear and on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 36]: Thinking quickly , he decided that the burly person whose outer garments he was now wearing had probably been taking a short cut to the station entrance when he received the surprise of his life .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 33]: Somewhat higher up on the right , therefore , Dalroy went back to the narrow pavement close to the wall , and saw some soldiers coming through a doorway a little ahead .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 24]: He made for this , growled a husky `` Good-morning '' to a sentry stationed there , entered , and mounted a staircase .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 33]: Soon he found himself on the main platform ; he actually passed a sergeant and some Bavarian soldiers , bent on recapturing the escaped prisoner , rushing wildly for the same stairs .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: None paid heed to him as he lumbered along , swinging the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 40]: A small crowd of officers , among them the youthful prince in the silver _ Pickel-haube _ , had collected near the broken window and now open door of the waiting-room from which the `` spy '' had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 15]: Within was the fat lieutenant of reserves , gesticulating violently at a pallid sentry .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: The prince was laughing .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 12]: `` He ca n't get away , '' he was saying .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 5]: `` A bold rascal .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 8]: He must be quieted with a bayonet-thrust .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 16]: That 's the best way to inoculate an Englishman with German _ Kultur _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 11]: Of course this stroke of rare wit evoked much mirth .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 30]: Meanwhile , Dalroy was turning the key in the lock which held Irene Beresford in safe keeping until Von Halwig had discharged certain pressing duties as a staff officer .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 34]: The girl , who was seated , gave him a terrified glance when he entered , but dropped her eyes immediately until she became aware that this rough-looking visitor was altering the key .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 20]: Dalroy then realised by her startled movement that his appearance had brought fresh terror to an already overburthened heart .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 27]: Hitherto , so absorbed was he in his project , he had not given a thought to the fact that he would offer a sinister apparition .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 20]: `` Do n't scream , or change your position , Miss Beresford , '' he said quietly in English .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 8]: `` It is I , Captain Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 7]: We have a chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 7]: Will you take the risk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 20]: The answer came , brokenly it is true , but with the girl 's very soul in the words .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 3]: `` Risk ?
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 17]: I would sacrifice ten lives , if I had them , rather than remain here . ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 13]: Somehow , that was the sort of answer Dalroy expected from her .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 11]: She sought no explanation of his bizarre and extraordinary garb .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 12]: It was all-sufficient for her that he should have come back .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 17]: She trusted him implicitly , and the low , earnest words thrilled him to the core .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 16]: He saw through the window that no one was paying any attention to this apartment .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 25]: Possibly , the only people who knew that it contained an Englishwoman as a prisoner were Von Halwig and the infuriated lieutenant of reserves .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 38]: Jumping on to a chair , Dalroy promptly twisted an electric bulb out of its socket , and plunged the room in semi-darkness , which he increased by hiding the hand-lamp in the folds of his blouse .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 37]: Given time , no doubt , a dim light would be borrowed from the platform and the windows overlooking the square ; in the sudden gloom , however , the two could hardly distinguish each other .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 30]: `` I have contrived to escape , in a sense , '' said Dalroy ; `` but I could not bear the notion of leaving you to your fate .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 15]: You can either stop here and take your chance , or come with me .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 16]: If we are caught together a second time these brutes will show you no mercy .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 22]: On the other hand , by remaining , you may be fairly well treated , and even sent home soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 17]: He deemed himself in honour bound to put what seemed then a reasonable alternative before her .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 38]: He did truly believe , in that hour , that Germany might , indeed , wage war inflexibly , but with clean hands , as befitted a nation which prided itself on its ideals and warrior spirit .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 29]: He was destined soon to be enlightened as to the true significance of the _ Kultur _ which a jack-boot philosophy offers to the rest of the world .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 10]: But Irene Beresford 's womanly intuition did not err .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 24]: One baleful gleam from Von Halwig 's eyes had given her a glimpse of infernal depths to which Dalroy was blind as yet .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 36]: `` Not only will I come with you ; but , if you have a pistol or a knife , I implore you to kill me before I am captured again , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 18]: Here , then , was no waste of words , but rather the ring of finely-tempered steel .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 9]: Dalroy unlocked the door , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 12]: To the right and in front the platform was nearly empty .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 50]: On the left the group of officers was crowding into the waiting-room , since some hint of unfathomable mystery had been wafted up from the Bavarians in the courtyard , and the slim young prince , curious as a street lounger , had gone to the window to investigate .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 6]: Dalroy stood in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 22]: `` Pull down your veil , turn to the right , and keep close to the wall , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 5]: `` Do n't run !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 5]: Do n't even hurry !
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 15]: If I seem to lag behind , speak sharply to me in German . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 5]: She obeyed without hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 19]: They had reached the end of the covered-in portion of the station when a sentry barred the way .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 13]: He brought his rifle with fixed bayonet to the `` engage . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 9]: `` It is forbidden , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: `` What is forbidden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 18]: grinned Dalroy amiably , clipping his syllables , and speaking in the roughest voice he could assume .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 9]: `` You can not pass this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 8]: Then I can go home to bed .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 9]: That will be better than cleaning engines . ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 27]: Fortunately , a Bavarian regiment was detailed for duty at Aix-la-Chapelle that night ; the sentry knew where the engine-sheds were situated no more than Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: Further , he was not familiar with the Aachen accent .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 8]: `` Oh , is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 6]: Look at my cap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 6]: Dalroy held up the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 7]: The official lettering was evidently convincing .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: `` But what about the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: `` She 's my wife .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 13]: If you 're here in half-an-hour she 'll bring you some coffee .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 16]: One does n't leave a young wife at home with so many soldiers about . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 21]: `` If you both stand chattering here neither of you will get any coffee , '' put in Irene emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 6]: The Bavarian lowered his rifle .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 15]: `` I 'm relieved at two o'clock , '' he said with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 10]: `` Lose no time , _ schoene Frau _ .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 13]: There wo n't be much coffee on the road to Liège . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 9]: The girl passed on , but Dalroy lingered .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 9]: `` Is that where you 're going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 10]: We 're due in Paris in three weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 5]: `` Lucky dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 15]: `` Hans , are you coming , or shall I go on alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 3]: demanded Irene .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 19]: `` Farewell , comrade , for a little ten minutes , '' growled Dalroy , and he followed .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 22]: An empty train stood in a bay on the right , and Dalroy espied a window-cleaner 's ladder in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 9]: `` Where are you going , woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 29]: His `` wife '' was walking down the main platform which ended against the wall of a signal-cabin , and there might be insuperable difficulties in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 9]: `` Is n't this the easiest way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 3]: she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 12]: `` Yes , if you want to get run over . ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 25]: Without waiting for her , he turned , shouldered the ladder , and made for a platform on the inner side of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 9]: A ten-foot wall indicated the station 's boundary .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 5]: Irene ran after him .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 16]: Within a few yards they were hidden by the train from the sentry 's sight .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 8]: `` That was clever of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 4]: she whispered breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 16]: `` Speak German , even when you think we are alone , '' he commanded .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 13]: The platform curved sharply , and the train was a long one .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 12]: When they neared the engine they saw three men standing there .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 40]: Dalroy at once wrapped the lamp in a fold of his blouse , and leaped into the black shadow cast by the wall , which lay athwart the flood of moonlight pouring into the open part of the station .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 20]: Quick to take the cue , it being suicidal to think of bamboozling local railway officials , Irene followed .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 28]: Kicking off the clumsy sabots , Dalroy bade his companion pick them up , ran back some thirty yards , and placed the ladder against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 50]: Mounting swiftly , he found , to his great relief , that some sheds with low-pitched roofs were ranged beneath ; otherwise , the height of the wall , if added to the elevation of the station generally above the external ground level , might well have proved disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 23]: `` Up you come , '' he said , seating himself astride the coping-stones , and holding the top of the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 7]: Irene was soon perched there too .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 13]: He pulled up the ladder , and lowered it to a roof .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 15]: `` Now , you grab hard in case it slips , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 8]: Disdaining the rungs , he slid down .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 32]: He had hardly gathered his poise before the girl tumbled into his arms , one of the heavy wooden shoes she was carrying giving him a smart tap on the head .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 5]: `` These men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 9]: `` They saw me , and shouted . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 19]: Dalroy imagined that the trio near the engine must have noted the swinging lantern and its sudden disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 26]: With the instant decision born of polo and pig-sticking in India , he elected now not to essay the slanting roof just where they stood .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 25]: Shouldering the ladder again , he made off toward a strip of shadow which seemed to indicate the end of a somewhat higher shed .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 11]: Irene followed , and they crouched there in panting silence .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 34]: Nearly every German is a gymnast , and it was no surprise to Dalroy when one of their pursuers mounted on the shoulders of a friend and gained the top of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: `` There 's nothing to be seen here , '' he announced after a brief survey .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 24]: The pair beneath must have answered , because he went on , evidently in reply , `` Oh , I saw it myself .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 11]: And I 'm sure there was some one up here .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 8]: There 's a sentry on No. 5 .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 17]: Run , Fritz , and ask him if a man with a lantern has passed recently .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: I 'll mount guard till you return . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 21]: Happily a train approached , and , in the resultant din Dalroy was enabled to scramble down the roof unheard .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 43]: The ladder just reached the ground ; so , before Fritz and the sentry began to suspect that some trickery was afoot in that part of the station , the two fugitives were speeding through a dark lane hemmed in by warehouses .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 10]: At the first opportunity , Dalroy extinguished the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 10]: Then he bethought him of his companion 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 10]: He halted suddenly ere they entered a lighted thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 14]: `` I had better put on these clogs again , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 6]: `` But what about you ?
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 30]: It will never do for a lady in smart attire to be seen walking through the streets with a ruffian like me at one o'clock in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 23]: For answer , the girl took off her hat and tore away a cluster of roses and a coquettish bow of ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 14]: Then she discarded her jacket , which she adjusted loosely across her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 16]: `` Now I ought to look raffish enough for anything , '' she said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 25]: Singularly enough , her confidence raised again in Dalroy 's mind a lurking doubt which the success thus far achieved had not wholly stilled .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 21]: `` My candid advice to you now , Miss Beresford , is that you leave me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 30]: `` You will come to no harm in the main streets , and you speak German so well that you should have little difficulty in reaching the Dutch frontier .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 13]: Once in Holland you can travel to Brussels by way of Antwerp .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 9]: I believe England has declared war against Germany .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 16]: The behaviour of Von Halwig and those other Prussians is most convincing on that point .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 15]: If so -- '' `` Does my presence imperil you , Captain Dalroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 4]: she broke in .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 19]: She could have said nothing more unwise , nothing so subtly calculated to stir a man 's pride .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 8]: `` No , '' he answered shortly .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 28]: `` Why , then , are you so anxious to get rid of me , after risking your life to save me a few minutes ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 8]: `` I am going straight into Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 6]: I deem it my duty .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 12]: I may pick up information of the utmost military value . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 19]: `` Then I go into Belgium too , unless you positively refuse to be bothered with my company .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 13]: I simply must reach my sister without a moment of unnecessary delay .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 17]: And is it really sensible to stand here arguing , so close to the station ? ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 7]: They went on without another word .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 15]: Dalroy was ruffled by the suggestion that he might be seeking his own safety .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 18]: Trust any woman to find the joint in any man 's armour when it suits her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 24]: Aix-la-Chapelle was more awake on that Wednesday morning at one o'clock than on any ordinary day at the same hour in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 26]: The streets were alive with excited people , the taverns and smaller shops open , the main avenues crammed with torrents of troops streaming westward .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 16]: Regimental bands struck up martial airs as column after column debouched from the various stations .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 38]: When the musicians paused for sheer lack of breath the soldiers bawled '' _ Deutschland , Deutschland , über alles _ '' or '' _ Die Wacht am Rhine _ '' at the top of their voices .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 13]: The uproar was , as the Germans love to say , colossal .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 6]: The enthusiasm was colossal too .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 10]: Aix-la-Chapelle might have been celebrating a great national festival .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 14]: It seemed ludicrous to regard the community as in the throes of war .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 30]: The populace , the officers , even the heavy-jowled peasants who formed the majority of the regiments then hurrying to the front , seemed to be intoxicated with joy .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 6]: Dalroy was surprised at first .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 21]: He was not prepared for the savage exultation with which German militarism leaped to its long-dreamed-of task of conquering Europe .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 38]: Irene Beresford , momentarily more alive than he to the exigencies of their position , bought a common shawl at a shop in a side street , and threw away her tattered hat with a careless laugh .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 6]: She was an excellent actress .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 21]: The woman who served her had not the remotest notion that this bright-eyed girl belonged to the hated English race .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 25]: The incident brought back Dalroy 's vagrom thoughts from German methods of making war to the serious business which was his own particular concern .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 37]: The shop was only a couple of doors removed from the Franz Strasse ; he waited for Irene at the corner , buying some cheap cigars and a box of matches at a tobacconist 's kiosk .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 13]: He still retained the lantern , which lent a touch of character .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 17]: The carriage-cleaner 's breeches were wide and loose at the ankles , and concealed his boots .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 53]: Between the sabots and his own heels he had added some inches to his height , so he could look easily over the heads of the crowd ; he was watching the passing of a battery of artillery when an open automobile was jerked to a standstill directly in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 8]: In the car was seated Von Halwig .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 47]: That sprig of Prussian nobility was in a mighty hurry , but even he dared not interfere too actively with troops in motion , so , to pass the time as it were , he rolled his eyes in anger at the crowd on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 41]: It was just possible that Irene might appear inopportunely , so Dalroy rejoined her , and led her to the opposite side of the cross street , where a wagon and horses hid her from the Guardsman 's sharp eyes .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 13]: Thus it happened that Chance again took the wanderers under her wing .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 32]: A short , thick-set Walloon had emptied a glass of schnapps at the counter of a small drinking-bar which opened on to the street , and was bidding the landlady farewell .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 10]: `` I must be off , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 10]: `` I have to be in Visé by daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 11]: This cursed war has kept me here a whole day .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 12]: Who is fighting who , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 4]: `` Visé ! ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 8]: guffawed a man seated at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 7]: `` You 'll never get there .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 9]: The army wo n't let you pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 37]: `` That 's the army 's affair , not mine , '' was the typically Flemish answer , and the other came out , mounted the wagon , chirped to his horses , and made away .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 28]: Dalroy was able to note the name on a small board affixed to the side of the vehicle : `` Henri Joos , miller , Visé . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 34]: `` That fellow lives in Belgium , '' he whispered to Irene , who had draped the shawl over her head and neck , and now carried the jacket rolled into a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 17]: `` He is just the sort of dogged countryman who will tackle and overcome all obstacles .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 19]: I fancy he is carrying oats to a mill , and will be known to the frontier officials .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 10]: Shall we bargain with him for a lift ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 12]: `` It sounds the very thing , '' agreed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 14]: In their eagerness , neither took the precaution of buying something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 10]: They overtook the wagon before it passed the market .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 11]: The driver was not Joos , but Joos 's man .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 50]: He was quite ready to earn a few francs , or marks -- he did not care which -- by conveying a couple of passengers to the placid little town of whose mere existence the wide world outside Belgium was unaware until that awful first week in August 1914 .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 71]: And so it came to pass that Dalroy and his protégé passed out of Aix-la-Chapelle without let or hindrance , because the driver , spurred to an effort of the imagination by promise of largesse , described Irene to the Customs men as Henri Joos 's niece , and Dalroy as one deputed by the railway to see that a belated consignment of oats was duly delivered to the miller .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: Neither rural Germany nor rural Belgium was yet really at war .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 18]: The monstrous shadow had darkened the chancelleries , but it was hardly perceptible to the common people .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 13]: Moreover , how could red-fanged war affect a remote place like Visé ?
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 5]: The notion was nonsensical .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 24]: Even Dalroy allowed himself to assure his companion that there was now a reasonable prospect of reaching Belgian soil without incurring real danger .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 22]: Yet , in truth , he was taking her to an inferno of which the like is scarce known to history .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 21]: The gate which opened at the Customs barrier gave access apparently to a good road leading through an undulating country .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 11]: In sober truth , it led to an earthly hell .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 34]: CHAPTER III FIRST BLOOD Though none of the three in the wagon might even hazard a guess at the tremendous facts , the German wolf had already made his spring and been foiled .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 24]: Not only had he missed his real quarry , France , he had also broken his fangs on the tough armour of Liège .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 11]: These things Dalroy and Irene Beresford were to learn soon .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 22]: The first intimation that the Belgian army had met and actually fought some portion of the invading host came before dawn .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 23]: The road to Visé ran nearly parallel with , but some miles north of , the main artery between Aix-la-Chapelle and Liège .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 16]: During the small hours of the night it held a locust flight of German cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 51]: Squadron after squadron , mostly Uhlans , trotted past the slow-moving cart ; but Joos 's man , Maertz , if stolid and heavy-witted , had the sense to pull well out of the way of these hurrying troopers ; beyond evoking an occasional curse , he was not molested .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 14]: The brilliant moon , though waning , helped the riders to avoid him .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 27]: Dalroy and the girl were comfortably seated , and almost hidden , among the sacks of oats ; they were free to talk as they listed .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 36]: Naturally , a soldier 's eyes took in details at once which would escape a woman ; but Irene Beresford soon noted signs of the erratic fighting which had taken place along that very road .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 9]: `` Surely we are in Belgium now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 24]: she whispered , after an awed glance at the lights and bustling activity of a field hospital established near the hamlet of Aubel .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' said Dalroy quietly , `` we have been in Belgium fully an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 13]: `` And have the Germans actually attacked this dear little country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 7]: `` So it would seem . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 10]: I have always understood that Belgium was absolutely safe .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 13]: All the great nations of the world have guaranteed her integrity . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 24]: `` That has been the main argument of every spouter at International Peace Congresses for many a year , '' said Dalroy bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 26]: `` If Belgium and Holland can be preserved by agreement , they contended , why should not all other vexed questions be settled by arbitration ?
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 41]: Yet one of our chaps in the Berlin Embassy , the man whose ticket you travelled with , told me that the Kaiser could be bluntly outspoken when that very question was raised during the autumn manoeuvres last year . '
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 27]: I shall sweep through Belgium thus , ' he said , swinging his arm as though brushing aside a feeble old crone who barred his way .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 11]: And he was talking to a British officer too . ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 5]: `` What a crime !
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 6]: These poor , inoffensive people !
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 9]: Have they resisted , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 14]: `` That field hospital looked pretty busy , '' was the grim answer .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 22]: A little farther on , at a cross-road , there could no longer be any doubt as to what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 9]: The remains of a barricade littered the ditches .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 13]: Broken carts , ploughs , harrows , and hurdles lay in heaps .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 19]: The carcasses of scores of dead horses had been hastily thrust aside so as to clear a passage .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 46]: In a meadow , working by the light of lanterns , gangs of soldiers and peasants were digging long pits , while row after row of prone figures could be glimpsed when the light carried by those directing the operations chanced to fall on them .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 35]: Dalroy knew , of course , that all the indications pointed to a successful , if costly , German advance , which was the last thing he had counted on in this remote countryside .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 47]: If the tide of war was rolling into Belgium it should , by his reckoning , have passed to the south-west , engulfing the upper valley of the Meuse and the two Luxembourgs perhaps , but leaving untouched the placid land on the frontier of Holland .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 14]: For a time he feared that Holland , too , was being attacked .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 44]: Understanding something of German pride , though far as yet from plumbing the depths of German infamy , he imagined that the Teutonic host had burst all barriers , and was bent on making the Rhine a German river from source to sea .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 24]: Naturally he did not fail to realise that the lumbering wagon was taking him into a country already securely held by the assailants .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 14]: There were no guards at the cross-roads , no indications of military precautions .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 30]: The hospital , the grave-diggers , the successive troops of cavalry , felt themselves safe even in the semi-darkness , and this was the prerogative of a conquering army .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 58]: In the conditions , he did not regard his life as worth much more than an hour 's purchase , and he tortured his wits in vain for some means of freeing the girl , who reposed such implicit confidence in him , from the meshes of a net which he felt to be tightening every minute .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 21]: He simply dreaded the coming of daylight , heralded already by tints of heliotrope and pink in the eastern sky .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 14]: Certain undulating contours were becoming suspiciously clear in that part of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 25]: It might be only what Hafiz describes as the false dawn ; but , false or true , the new day was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 28]: He was on the verge of advising Irene to seek shelter in some remote hovel which their guide could surely recommend when Fate took control of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 24]: Maertz had now pulled up in obedience to an unusually threatening order from a Uhlan officer whose horse had been incommoded in passing .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 25]: Above the clatter of hoofs and accoutrements Dalroy 's trained ear had detected the sounds of a heavy and continuous cannonade toward the south-west .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 9]: `` How far are we from Visé ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 5]: he asked the driver .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 7]: The man pointed with his whip .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 10]: `` You see that black knob over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 12]: `` That 's a clump of trees just above the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 6]: Visé lies below it . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 6]: `` But how far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: `` Not more than two kilomètres . ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 3]: Two kilomètres !
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 7]: About a mile and a half !
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 6]: Dalroy was tortured by indecision .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 9]: `` Shall we be there by daybreak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: `` With luck .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 10]: I do n't know what 's been happening here .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: These damned Germans are swarming all over the place .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 9]: They must be making for the bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 5]: `` What bridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 10]: `` The bridge across the Meuse , of course .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 8]: Do n't you know these parts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 6]: `` Not very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 29]: `` I wish I were safe at home ; I 'd get indoors and stop there , '' growled the driver , chirping his team into motion again .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 6]: Dalroy 's doubts were stilled .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 12]: Better leave this rustic philosopher to work out their common salvation .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 9]: A few hundred yards ahead the road bifurcated .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 11]: One branch led to Visé , the other to Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 15]: Here was stationed a picket , evidently intended as a guide for the cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 18]: Most fortunately Dalroy read aright the intention of an officer who came forward with an electric torch .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 9]: `` Lie as flat as you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 5]: he whispered to Irene .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 12]: `` If they find us , pretend to be asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 6]: `` Hi , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 18]: cried the officer to Maertz , `` where the devil do you think you 're going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 14]: `` To Joos 's mill at Visé , '' said the gruff Walloon .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 8]: `` What 's in the cart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: `` Oats . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 3]: _ Almächtig !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 5]: _ Where from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 4]: `` Aachen . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 10]: `` You just pull ahead into that road there .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 15]: I 'll attend to you and your oats in a minute or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 9]: `` But ca n't I push on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 7]: The officer called to a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 16]: `` See that this fellow halts twenty yards up the road , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 12]: `` If he stirs then , put your bayonet through him .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 20]: These Belgian swine do n't seem to understand that they are Germans now , and must obey orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 30]: The officer , of course , spoke in German , the Walloon in the mixture of Flemish and Low Dutch which forms the _ patois _ of the district .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 33]: But each could follow the other 's meaning , and the quaking listeners in the middle of the wagon had no difficulty at all in comprehending the gravity of this new peril .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 22]: Maertz was swearing softly to himself ; they heard him address a question to the sentry when the wagon stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 13]: `` Why wo n't your officer let us go to Visé ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 6]: `` Sheep 's - head !
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: do as you 're told , or it will be bad for you , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 30]: The words were hardly out of the soldier 's mouth before a string of motor lorries , heavy vehicles with very powerful engines , thundered up from the rear .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 13]: The leaders passed without difficulty , as there was plenty of room .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 21]: But their broad flat tires sucked up clouds of dust , and the moon had sunk behind a wooded height .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 17]: One of the hindermost transports , taking too wide a bend , crashed into the wagon .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 20]: The startled horses plunged , pulled Maertz off his perch , and dragged the wagon into a deep ditch .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 28]: It fell on its side , and Dalroy and his companion were thrown into a field amid a swirl of laden sacks , some of which burst .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 17]: Dalroy was unhurt , and he could only hope that the girl also had escaped injury .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 21]: Ere he rose he clasped her around the neck and clapped a hand over her mouth lest she should scream .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 6]: `` Not a word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: he breathed into her ear .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 17]: `` Can you manage to crawl on all-fours straight on by the side of the hedge ?
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 6]: Never mind thorns or nettles .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 7]: It 's our only chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 28]: In a few seconds they were free of the hubbub which sprang up around the overturned wagon and the transport , the latter having shattered a wheel .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 15]: Soon they were able to rise , crouching behind the hedge as they ran .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 24]: They turned at an angle , and struck off into the country , following the line of another hedge which trended slightly uphill .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 22]: At a gateway they turned again , moving , as Dalroy calculated , on the general line of the Visé road .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 10]: A low-roofed shanty loomed up suddenly against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 46]: It was just the place to house an outpost , and Dalroy was minded to avoid it when the lowing of a cow in pain revealed to his trained intelligence the practical certainty that the animal had been left there unattended , and needed milking .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 8]: Still , he took no unnecessary risks .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 8]: `` Remain here , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 17]: `` I 'll go ahead and investigate , and return in a minute or so . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 16]: He did not notice that the girl sank beneath the hedge with a suspicious alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 18]: He was a man , a fighter , with the hot breath of war in his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 14]: Not yet had he sensed the cruel strain which war places on women .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 13]: Moreover , his faculties were centred in the task of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 35]: The soldier is warned not to take his eyes off the enemy while reloading his rifle lest the target be lost ; similarly , Dalroy knew that concentration was the prime essential of scout-craft .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 41]: Thus he was deaf to the distant thunder of guns , but alive to the least rustle inside the building ; blind to certain ominous gleams on the horizon , but quick to detect any moving object close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 35]: He made out that a door stood open ; so , after a few seconds ' pause , he slipped rapidly within , and stood near the wall on the side opposite the hinges .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: An animal stirred uneasily , and the plaintive lowing ceased .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 31]: He had dropped the sabots long since , and the lamp was lost in the spill out of the wagon , but most fortunately he had matches in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 21]: He closed the door softly , struck a match , guarding the flame with both hands , and looked round .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 12]: He found himself in a ramshackle shed , half-barn , half-stable .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 15]: In a stall was tethered a black-and-white cow , her udder distended with milk .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 53]: Huddled up against the wall was the corpse of a woman , an old peasant , whose wizened features had that waxen tint of _ camailleu gris _ with which , in their illuminated missals of the Middle Ages , the monks loved to portray the sufferings of the early Christian martyrs .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 9]: She had been stabbed twice through the breast .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 14]: An overturned pail and milking-stool showed how and where death had surprised her .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 16]: The match flickered out , and Dalroy was left in the darkness of the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 37]: He had a second match in his hand , and was on the verge of striking it when he heard a man 's voice and the swish of feet through the grass of the pasture without .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 19]: `` This is the place , Heinrich , '' came the words in guttural German , and breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 17]: Then , with certain foulnesses of expression , the speaker added , `` I 'm puffed .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 9]: That girl fought like a wild cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 16]: `` She 's pretty , too , for a Belgian , '' agreed another voice .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 3]: `` So .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 26]: But I could n't put up with her screeching when you told her that a bayonet had stopped her grandam 's nagging tongue . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 5]: _ Ach , was !
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 8]: _ What matter , at eighty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 7]: Dalroy had pulled the door open .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 17]: Stooping , he sought for and found the milking-stool , a solid article of sound oak .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 26]: Through a chink he saw two dark forms ; glints of the dawn on fixed bayonets showed that the men were carrying their rifles slung .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 11]: At the door the foremost switched on an electric torch .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 18]: `` You milk , Heinrich , '' he said , `` while I show a glim . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 42]: He advanced a pace , as Dalroy expected he would , so the swing of the stool caught him on the right side of the head , partly on the ear and partly on the rim of his _ Pickel-haube _ .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 9]: But his skull was fractured for all that .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 18]: Heinrich fared no better , though the torch was shattered on the rough paving of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 15]: A thrust floored him , and he fell with a fearsome clatter of accoutrements .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 14]: A second blow on the temple stilled the startled oath on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 19]: Dalroy divested him of the rifle , and stuffed a few clips of cartridges into his own pockets .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 14]: Then , ready for any others of a cut-throat crew , he listened .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 12]: One of the pair on the ground was gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 6]: The cow began lowing again .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 20]: There was neither sight nor sound of Irene , though she must have heard enough to frighten her badly .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 5]: `` Miss Beresford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 20]: he said , in a sibilant hiss which would carry easily to the point where he had left her .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 4]: Nature was still .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 12]: It was as though inanimate things were awake , but quaking .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 13]: The breathing of the unnamed German changed abruptly into a gurgling croak .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 11]: Heinrich had traversed that stage swiftly under the second blow .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 17]: From the roads came the sharp rattle of horses ' feet , the panting of motors .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 9]: The thud of gun-fire smote the air incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 10]: It suggested the monstrous pulse-beat of an alarmed world .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 16]: Over a hilltop the beam of a searchlight hovered for an instant , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 13]: Belgium , little Belgium , was in a death-grapple with mighty Germany .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 13]: Even in her agony she was crying , `` What of England ?
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 5]: Will England help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 16]: Well , one Englishman had lessened by two the swarm of her enemies that night .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 22]: Dalroy was only vaguely conscious of the scope and magnitude of events in which he was bearing so small a part .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 28]: He knew enough of German methods in his immediate surroundings , however , to reck as little of having killed two men as though they were rats .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 14]: His sole and very real concern was for the girl who answered not .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 35]: Before going in search of her he was tempted to don a _ Pickel-haube _ , which , with the rifle and bayonet , would , in the misty light , deceive any new-comers .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 30]: But the field appeared to be untenanted , and it occurred to him that his companion might actually endeavour to hide if she took him for a German soldier .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 9]: So he did not even carry the weapon .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 6]: He found Irene at once .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 25]: She had simply fainted , and the man who now lifted her limp form tenderly in his arms was vexed at his own forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 10]: The girl had slept but little during two nights .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 6]: Meals were irregular and scanty .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 31]: She had lived in a constant and increasing strain , while the real danger and great physical exertion of the past few minutes had provided a climax beyond her powers .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 38]: Like the mass of young officers in the British army , Dalroy kept himself fit , even during furlough , by long walks , daily exercises , and systematic abstention from sleep , food , and drink .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: If a bed was too comfortable he changed it .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 18]: If an undertaking could be accomplished equally well in conditions of hardship or luxury he chose hardship .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 27]: Soldiering was his profession , and he held the theory that a soldier must always be ready to withstand the severest tax on brain and physique .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 37]: Therefore the minor privations of the journey from Berlin , with its decidedly strenuous sequel at Aix-la-Chapelle , and this D'Artagnan episode in the neighbourhood of Visé , had made no material drain on his resources .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 32]: A girl like Irene Beresford , swept into the sirocco of war from the ordered and sheltered life of a young Englishwoman of the middle-classes , was an altogether different case .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 32]: He believed her one of the small army of British-born women who find independence and fair remuneration for their services by acting as governesses and ladies ' companions on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 69]: Nearly every German family of wealth and social pretensions counted the _ Englische Fräulein _ as a member of the household ; even in autocratic Prussia , _ Kultur _ is not always spelt with a `` K. '' She was well-dressed , and supplied with ample means for travelling ; but plenty of such girls owned secured incomes , treating a salary as an `` extra . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 31]: Moreover , she spoke German like a native , had small sister in Brussels , and had evidently met Von Halwig in one of the great houses of the capital .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 25]: Undoubtedly , she was a superior type of governess , or , it might be , English mistress in a girls ' high school .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 32]: These considerations did not crowd in on Dalroy while he was holding her in close embrace in a field near Visé at dawn on the morning of Wednesday , 5th August .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 12]: They were the outcome of nebulous ideas formed in the train .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 29]: At present , his one thought was the welfare of a hapless woman of his own race , be she a peer 's daughter or a postman 's .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 23]: Now , skilled leader of men though he was , he had little knowledge of the orthodox remedies for a fainting woman .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 38]: Like most people , he was aware that a loosening of bodices and corsets , a chafing of hands , a vigorous massage of the feet and ankles , tended to restore circulation , and therefore consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 37]: But none of these simple methods was practicable when a party of German soldiers might be hunting for both of them , while another batch might be minded to follow `` Heinrich '' and his fellow-butcher .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 25]: So he carried her to the stable and laid her on a truss of straw noted during that first vivid glimpse of the interior .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 10]: Then , greatly daring , he milked the cow .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 30]: Not only did the poor creature 's suffering make an irresistible appeal , but in relieving her distress he was providing the best of nourishment for Irene and himself .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 6]: The cow gave no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 10]: Soon the milk was flowing steadily into the pail .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 5]: The darkness was abysmal .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 23]: On one hand lay a dead woman , on the other an unconscious one , and two dead men guarded the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 51]: Once , in Paris , Dalroy had seen one of the lurid playlets staged at the Grand Guignol , wherein a woman served a meal for a friend and chatted cheerfully during its progress , though the body of her murdered husband was stowed behind a couch and a window-curtain .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 18]: He recalled the horrid little tragedy now ; but that was make-believe , this was grim reality .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 13]: Yet he had ever an eye for the rectangle of the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 20]: When a quality of grayness sharpened its outlines he knew it was high time to be on the move .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 12]: Happily , at that instant , Irene sighed deeply and stirred .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 27]: Ere she had any definite sense of her surroundings she was yielding to Dalroy 's earnest appeal , and allowing him to guide her faltering steps .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 12]: He carried the pail and the rifle in his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 18]: With the right he gripped the girl 's arm , and literally forced her into a walk .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 27]: The wood indicated by Maertz was plainly visible now , and close at hand , and the first rays of daylight gave colour to the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 15]: The hour , as Dalroy ascertained later , was about a quarter to four .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 62]: It was vitally essential that they should reach cover within the next five minutes ; but his companion was so manifestly unequal to sustained effort that he was on the point of carrying her in order to gain the protection of the first hedgerow when he noticed that a slight depression in the hillside curved in the direction of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 12]: Here , too , were shrubs and tufts of long grass .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 17]: Indeed , the shallow trough proved to be one of the many heads of a ravine .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 20]: The discovery of a hidden way at that moment contributed as greatly as any other circumstance to their escape .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 15]: They soon learnt that the German hell-hounds were in full cry on their track .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 9]: At the first bend Dalroy called a halt .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 27]: He told Irene to sit down , and she obeyed so willingly that , rendered wiser by events , he feared lest she should faint again .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 53]: When travelling he made it a habit to carry two handkerchiefs , one for use and one in case of emergency , such as a bandage being in sudden demand , so he was able to produce a square of clean cambric , which he folded cup-shape and partly filled with milk .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 17]: It was the best substitute he could devise for a strainer , and it served admirably .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 28]: By this means they drank nearly all the milk he had secured , and , with each mouthful , Irene felt a new eichor in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 11]: For the first time she gave heed to the rifle .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 8]: `` How did you get that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 7]: she asked , wide-eyed with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 16]: `` I picked it up at the door of the shed , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 9]: `` I remember now , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 27]: `` You left me under a hedge while you crept forward to investigate , and I was silly enough to go off in a dead faint .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 9]: Did you carry me to the shed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: `` What a bother I must have been .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 15]: But the finding of a rifle does n't explain a can of milk . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 14]: `` The really important factor was the cow , '' he said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 14]: `` Now , young lady , if you can talk you can walk .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 9]: We have a little farther to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 5]: `` Have we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 8]: she retorted , bravely emulating his self-control .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 11]: `` I am glad you have fixed on our destination .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 27]: It 's quite a relief to be in charge of a man who really knows what he wants , and sees that he gets it . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 8]: He led the way , she followed .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 20]: He had an eye for all quarters , because daylight was coming now with the flying feet of Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 46]: But this tiny section of Belgium was free from Germans , for the very good reason that their cohorts already held the right bank of the Meuse at many points , and their engineers were throwing pontoon bridges across the river at Visé and Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 22]: From the edge of the wood Dalroy looked down on the river , the railway , and the little town itself .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 18]: He saw instantly that the whole district south of the Meuse was strongly held by the invaders .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 27]: Three arches of a fine stone bridge had been destroyed , evidently by the retreating Belgians ; but pontoons were in position to take its place .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 39]: Twice already had Belgian artillery destroyed the enemy 's work , and not even a professional soldier could guess that the guns of the defence were only awaiting a better light to smash the pontoons a third time .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 42]: In fact , barely half-a-mile to the right of the wood , a battery of four 5.9 's was posted on high ground , in the hope that the Belgian guns of smaller calibre might be located and crushed at once .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 36]: Even while the two stood looking down into the valley , a sputtering rifle-fire broke out across the river , three hundred yards wide at the bridge , and the volume of musketry steadily increased .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 20]: Men , horses , wagons , and motors swarmed on the roadway or sheltered behind warehouses on the quays .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 18]: As a soldier , Dalroy was amazed at the speed and annihilating completeness of the German mobilisation .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 31]: Indeed , he was chagrined by it , it seemed so admirable , so thoroughly thought-out in each detail , so unapproachable by any other nation in its pitiless efficiency .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 21]: He did not know then that the vaunted Prussian-made military machine depended for its motive-power largely on treachery and espionage .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 32]: Toward the close of July , many days before war was declared , Germany had secretly massed nine hundred thousand men on the frontiers of Belgium and the Duchy of Luxembourg .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 34]: Her armies , therefore , had gathered like felons , and were led by master-thieves in the persons of thousands of German officers domiciled in both countries in the guise of peaceful traders .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 17]: Single-minded person that he was , Dalroy at once focused his thoughts on the immediate problem .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: A small stream leaped down from the wood to the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 30]: Short of a main road bridge its turbulent course was checked by a mill-dam , and there was some reason to believe that the mill might be Joos 's .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 25]: The building seemed a prosperous place , with its two giant wheels on different levels , its ample granaries , and a substantial house .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 16]: It was intact , too , and somewhat apart from the actual line of battle .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 43]: At any rate , though the transition was the time-honoured one from the frying-pan to the fire , in that direction lay food , shelter , and human beings other than Germans , so he determined to go there without further delay .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 25]: His main purpose now was to lodge his companion with some Belgian family until the tide of war had swept far to the west .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 25]: For himself , he meant to cross the enemy 's lines by hook or by crook , or lose his life in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 18]: `` One more effort , '' he said , smiling confidently into Irene 's somewhat pallid face .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 10]: `` Your uncle lives below there , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 9]: We 're about to claim his hospitality . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 13]: He hid the rifle , bayonet , and cartridges in a thicket .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 7]: The milk-pail he took with him .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 33]: If they met a German patrol the pail might serve as an excuse for being out and about , whereas the weapons would have been a sure passport to the next world .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 12]: It was broad daylight when they entered the miller 's yard .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: They saw the name Henri Joos on a cart .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 5]: `` Good egg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 4]: cried Dalroy confidently .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 14]: `` I 'm glad Joos spells his Christian name in the French way .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: It shows that he means well , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 21]: CHAPTER IV THE TRAGEDY OF VISÉ Early as was the hour , a door leading to the dwelling-house stood open .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 22]: The sound of feet on the cobbled pavement of the mill-yard brought a squat , beetle-browed old man to the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: He surveyed the strangers with a curiously haphazard yet piercing underlook .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 9]: His black eyes held a glint of red .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 20]: Here was one in a subdued torment of rage , or , it might be , of ill-controlled panic .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 5]: `` What now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 8]: he grunted , using the local argot .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 24]: Dalroy , quick to read character , decided that this crabbed old Walloon was to be won at once or not at all .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 9]: `` Shall I speak French or German ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 4]: he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 5]: The other spat . ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 14]: _ Qu'est - ce que tu veux que je te dise , moi ?
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 5]: _ '' he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 20]: Now , the plain English of that question is , `` What do you wish me to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 19]: But the expectoration , no less than the biting tone , lent the words a far deeper meaning .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 4]: Dalroy was reassured .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: `` Are you Monsieur Henri Joos ? ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 4]: `` Ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 16]: `` This lady and I have come from Aix-la-Chapelle with your man , Maertz . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 10]: `` Oh , he 's alive , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 5]: `` I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 7]: But may we not enter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 24]: Joos eyed the engine-cleaner 's official cap and soiled clothes , and his suspicious gaze travelled to Dalroy 's well-fitting and expensive boots .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: `` Who the deuce are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 3]: he snapped .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 13]: `` I 'll tell you if you let us come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 7]: `` I ca n't hinder you .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 13]: It is an order , all doors must be left open . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 9]: Still , he made way , though ungraciously .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 26]: The refugees found themselves in a spacious kitchen , a comfortable and cleanly place , Dutch in its colourings and generally spick and span aspect .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 29]: A comely woman of middle age , and a plump , good-looking girl about as old as Irene , were seated on an oak bench beneath a window .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 18]: They were clinging to each other , and had evidently listened fearfully to the brief conversation without .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 31]: The only signs of disorder in the room were supplied by a quantity of empty wine-bottles , drinking-mugs , soiled plates , and cutlery , spread on a broad table .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 16]: Irene sank into one of half-a-dozen chairs which had apparently been used by the feasters .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 3]: Joos chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 7]: His laugh had an ugly sound .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 13]: `` Pity you were n't twenty minutes sooner , '' he guffawed .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 17]: `` You 'd have had company , pleasant company , visitors from across the frontier . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 23]: `` I , too , have crossed the frontier , '' said Irene , a wan smile lending pathos to her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 8]: `` I travelled with Germans from Berlin .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 13]: If I saw a German now I think I should die . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 7]: At that , Madame Joos rose .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 10]: `` Calm thyself , Henri , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 7]: `` These people are friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 8]: `` Maybe , '' retorted her husband .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 20]: He turned on Dalroy with surprising energy , seeing that he was some twenty years older than his wife .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 14]: `` You say that you came with Maertz , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 5]: `` Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: He has been absent four days . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 14]: By this time Dalroy thought he had taken the measure of his man .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 15]: No matter what the outcome to himself personally , Miss Beresford must be helped .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 10]: She could go no farther without food and rest .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: He risked everything on the spin of a coin .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 29]: `` We are English , '' he said , speaking very slowly and distinctly , so that each syllable should penetrate the combined brains of the Joos family .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 22]: `` We were only trying to leave Germany , meaning harm to none , but were arrested as spies at Aix-la-Chapelle .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: We escaped by a ruse .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 13]: I knocked a man silly , and took some of his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 21]: Then we happened on Maertz at a corner of Franz Strasse , and persuaded him to give us a lift .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 26]: We jogged along all right until we reached the cross-roads beyond the hill there , '' and he pointed in the direction of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 31]: `` A German officer refused to allow us to pass , but a motor transport knocked the wagon over , and this lady and I were thrown into a field .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 26]: We got away in the confusion , and made for a cowshed lying well back from the road and on the slope of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 29]: At that point my friend fainted , luckily for herself , because , when I examined the shed , I found the corpse of an old woman there .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 41]: She had evidently been about to milk a black-and-white cow when she was bayoneted by a German soldier -- '' He was interrupted by a choking sob from Madame Joos , who leaned a hand on the table for support .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 34]: In pose and features she would have served as a model for Hans Memling 's `` portrait '' of Saint Elizabeth , which in happier days used to adorn the hospital at Bruges .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 9]: `` The Widow Jaquinot , '' she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 16]: `` Of course , madame , I do n't know the poor creature 's name .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 17]: I was wondering how to act for the best when two soldiers came to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: I heard what they were saying .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 26]: One of them admitted that he had stabbed the old woman ; his words also implied that he and his comrade had violated her granddaughter .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 12]: So I picked up a milking-stool and killed both of them .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 27]: I took one of their rifles , which , with its bayonet and a number of cartridges , I hid at the top of the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 11]: This is the pail which I found in the shed .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: No doubt it belongs to the Jaquinot household .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 10]: Now , I have told you the actual truth .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: I ask nothing for myself .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 20]: If I stay here , even though you permit it , my presence will certainly bring ruin on you .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 7]: So I shall go at once .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 53]: But I _ do _ ask you , as Christian people , to safeguard this young English lady , and , when conditions permit , and she has recovered her strength , to guide her into Holland , unless , that is , these German beasts are attacking the Dutch too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 8]: For a brief space there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 20]: Dalroy looked fixedly at Joos , trying to read Irene Beresford 's fate in those black , glowing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 34]: The womenfolk were won already ; but well he knew that in this Belgian nook the patriarchal principle that a man is lord and master in his own house would find unquestioned acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 17]: He was aware that Irene 's gaze was riveted on him in a strangely magnetic way .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 57]: It was one thing that he should say calmly , `` So I picked up a milking-stool , and killed both of them , '' but quite another that Irene should visualise in the light of her rare intelligence the epic force of the tragedy enacted while she lay unconscious in the depths of a hedgerow .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 17]: Dalroy could tell , Heaven knows how , that her very soul was peering at him .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 14]: In that tense moment he knew that he was her man for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 8]: But -- _ surgit amari aliquid _ !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 35]: A wave of bitterness welled up from heart to brain because of the conviction that if he would , indeed , be her true knight he must leave her within the next few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 7]: Yet his resolution did not waver .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 12]: Not once did his glance swerve from Joos 's wizened face .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 21]: It was the miller himself who first broke the spell cast on the curiously assorted group by Dalroy 's story .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: He stretched out a hand and took the pail .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 14]: `` This is fresh milk , '' he said , examining the dregs .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 5]: I milked the cow .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 17]: The poor animal was in pain , and my friend and I wanted the milk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 9]: `` You milked the cow -- before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 3]: After . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 5]: _ `` Grand Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 9]: _ you 're English , without doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 11]: Joos turned the pail upside down , appraising it critically .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` it 's one of Dupont 's .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: I remember her buying it .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 10]: She gave him fifty kilos of potatoes for it .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 7]: She stuck him , he said .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 6]: Half the potatoes were black .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 11]: A rare hand at a bargain , the Veuve Jaquinot .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 8]: And she 's dead you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 5]: A bayonet thrust ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 4]: `` Two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 7]: Madame Joos burst into hysterical sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 21]: Her husband whisked round on her with that singular alertness of movement which was one of his most marked characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 6]: `` Peace , wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 3]: he snapped .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 11]: `` Is n't that what we 're all coming to ?
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 14]: What matter to Dupont now whether the potatoes were black or sound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 10]: Dalroy guessed that Dupont was the iron-monger of Visé .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 15]: He was gaining a glimpse , too , of the indomitable soul of Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 15]: Though itching for information , he checked the impulse , because time pressed horribly .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he said , `` will you do what you can for the lady ?
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 6]: The Germans have spared you .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 5]: You have fed them .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: They may treat you decently .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: I 'll make it worth while .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 11]: I have plenty of money -- '' Irene stood up .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 32]: `` Monsieur , '' she said , and her voice was sweet as the song of a robin , `` it is idle to speak of saving one without the other .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 7]: Where Monsieur Dalroy goes I go .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 8]: If he dies , I die . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 15]: For the first time since entering the mill Dalroy dared to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 18]: In the sharp , crisp light of advancing day her blue eyes held a tint of violet .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 18]: Tear-drops glistened in the long lashes ; but she smiled wistfully , as though pleading for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 24]: `` That is sheer nonsense , '' he cried in English , making a miserable failure of the anger he tried to assume .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 9]: `` You ought to be reasonably safe here .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 13]: By insisting on remaining with me you deliberately sacrifice both our lives .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 31]: That is , I mean , '' he added hastily , aware of a slip , `` you prevent me too from taking the chance of escape that offers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 17]: `` If that were so I would not thrust myself on you , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 7]: `` But I know the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 9]: I know how they mean to wage war .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 7]: They make no secret of it .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 12]: They intend to strike terror into every heart at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 8]: They are not men , but super-brutes .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 12]: You saw Von Halwig at Berlin , and again at Aix-la-Chapelle .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 49]: If a titled Prussian can change his superficial manners -- not his nature , which remains invariably bestial -- to that extent in a day , before he has even the excuse of actual war , what will the same man become when roused to fury by resistance ?
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 8]: But we must not talk English . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 5]: She turned to Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 33]: `` Tell us , then , monsieur , '' she said , grave and serious as Pallas Athena questioning Perseus , `` have not the Prussians already ravaged and destroyed Visé ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 15]: The old man 's face suddenly lost its bronze , and became ivory white .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 5]: His features grew convulsed .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 16]: He resembled one of those grotesque masks carved by Japanese artists to simulate a demon .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: `` Curse them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 3]: he shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 16]: `` Curse them in life and in death -- man , woman , and child !
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 15]: What has Belgium done that she should be harried by a pack of wolves ?
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 9]: Who can say what wolves will do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 7]: Joos was aboil with vitriolic passion .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 35]: There was no knowing how long this tirade might have gone on had not a speckled hen stalked firmly in through the open door with obvious and settled intent to breakfast on crumbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 3]: _ Ciel !
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: _ '' cackled the orator .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: `` Not a fowl was fed overnight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 18]: In real life , as on the stage , comedy and tragedy oft go hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 9]: But the speckled hen deserved a good meal .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 41]: Her entrance undoubtedly stemmed the floodtide of her owner 's patriotic wrath , and thus enabled the five people in the kitchen to overhear a hoarse cry from the roadway : `` Hi , there , _ dummer Esel _ !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 4]: whither goest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 7]: This is Joos 's mill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 6]: `` Quick , Léontine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 3]: cried Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 8]: `` To the second loft with them !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 5]: Sharp , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 39]: In this unexpected crisis , Dalroy could neither protest nor refuse to accompany the girl , who led him and Irene up a back stair and through a well-stored granary to a ladder which communicated with a trap-door .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 19]: `` I 'll bring you some coffee and eggs as soon as I can , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: `` Draw up the ladder , and close the door .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 8]: It 's not so bad up there .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 13]: There 's a window , but take care you are n't seen .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 16]: Maybe , '' she added tremulously , `` you are safer than we now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: Dalroy realised that it was best to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 6]: `` Courage , mademoiselle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 17]: `` God is still in heaven , and all will be well with the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 12]: `` Please , monsieur , what became of Jan Maertz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 4]: she inquired timidly .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 17]: `` I 'm not quite certain , but I think he fell clear of the wagon .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 8]: The Germans should not have ill-treated him .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 8]: The collision was not his fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 8]: The girl sobbed , and left them .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 8]: Probably the gruff Walloon was her lover .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 4]: Irene climbed first .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 13]: Dalroy followed , raised the ladder noiselessly , and lowered the trap .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 36]: His brow was seamed with foreboding , as , despite his desire to leave his companion in the care of the miller 's household , he had an instinctive feeling that he was acting unwisely .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 17]: Moreover , like every free man , he preferred to seek the open when in peril .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 6]: Now he felt himself caged .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 9]: Therefore was he amazed when Irene laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 10]: `` How readily you translate Browning into French ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 7]: He gazed at her in wonderment .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 35]: Less than an hour ago she had fainted under the stress of hunger and dread , yet here was she talking as though they had met in the breakfast-room of an English country house .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 18]: He would have said something , but the ancient mill trembled under the sudden crash of artillery .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 23]: The roof creaked , the panes of glass in the dormer window rattled , and fragments of mortar fell from the walls .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 33]: Unmindful , for the moment , of Léontine Joos 's warning , Dalroy went to the window , which commanded a fine view of the town , river , and opposite heights .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: The pontoon bridge was broken .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 6]: Several pontoons were in splinters .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 11]: The others were swinging with the current toward each bank .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 40]: Six Belgian field-pieces had undone the night 's labour , and a lively rat-tat of rifles , mixed with the stutter of machine guns , proved that the defenders were busy among the Germans trapped on the north bank .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 46]: The heavier ordnance brought to the front by the enemy soon took up the challenge ; troops occupying the town , which , for the most part , lies on the south bank , began to cover the efforts of the engineers , instantly renewed .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 15]: History was being written in blood that morning on both sides of the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 20]: The splendid defence offered by a small Belgian force was thwarting the advance of the 9th German Army Corps .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 23]: Similarly , the 10th and 7th were being held up at Verviers and on the direct road from Aix to Liège respectively .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 67]: All this meant that General Leman , the heroic commander-in-chief at Liège , was given most precious time to garrison that strong fortress , construct wire entanglements , lay mines , and destroy roads and railways , which again meant that Von Emmich 's sledge-hammer blows with three army corps failed to overwhelm Liège in accordance with the dastardly plan drawn up by the German staff .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 23]: Dalroy , though he might not realise the marvellous fact then , was in truth a spectator of a serious German defeat .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 28]: Even in the conditions , he was aglow with admiration for the pluck of the Belgians in standing up so valiantly against the merciless might of Germany .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 26]: The window was dust-laden as the outcome of earlier gun-fire , and he was actually on the point of opening it when Irene stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 14]: `` Those men below may catch sight of you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 5]: He stepped back hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 22]: Two forage-carts had been brought into the yard , and preparations were being made to load them with oats and hay .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 12]: A truculent-looking sergeant actually lifted his eyes to that particular window .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: But he could not see through the dimmed panes , and was only estimating the mill 's probable contents .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 4]: Dalroy laughed constrainedly .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 14]: `` You are the better soldier of the two , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 5]: `` I nearly blundered .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 9]: Still , I wish the window was open .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: I want to size up the chances of the Belgians .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 24]: Those are bigger guns which are answering , and a duel between big guns and little ones can have only one result . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 19]: Seemingly , the German battery of quick-firers had located its opponents , because the din now became terrific .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 37]: As though in response to Dalroy 's desire , three panes of glass fell out owing to atmospheric concussion , and the watchers in the loft could follow with ease the central phase of the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 39]: The noise of the battle was redoubled by the accident to the window , and the air-splitting snarl of the high-explosive shells fired by the 5.9 's in the effort to destroy the Belgian guns was specially deafening .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 15]: That sound , more than any other , seemed to affect Irene 's nerves .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 26]: Involuntarily she clung to Dalroy 's arm , and he , with no other intent than to reassure her , drew her trembling form close .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 11]: It was evident that the assailants were suffering heavy losses .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 22]: Scores of men fell every few minutes among the bridge-builders , while casualties were frequent among the troops lining the quays .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 44]: Events on the Belgian side of the river were not so marked ; but even Irene could make out the precise moment when the defenders ' fire slackened , and the line of pontoons began to reach out again toward the farther shore .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 10]: `` Are the poor Belgians beaten , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 26]: she asked , with a tender sympathy which showed how lightly she estimated her own troubles in comparison with the agony of a whole nation .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 9]: `` I think not , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 35]: `` I imagine they have changed the position of some , at least , of their guns , and will knock that bridge to smithereens again just as soon as it nears completion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: The forage-carts rumbled out of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 33]: Dalroy noticed that the soldiers wore linen covers over the somewhat showy _ Pickel-hauben _ , though the regiments he had seen in Aix-la-Chapelle swaggered through the streets in their ordinary helmets .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 8]: This was another instance of German thoroughness .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 52]: The invisibility of the gray-green uniform was not so patent when the _ Pickel-haube _ lent its glint , but no sooner had the troops crossed the frontier than the linen cover was adjusted , and the masses of men became almost merged in the browns and greens of the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 29]: The two were so absorbed in the drama being fought out before their eyes that they were quite startled by a series of knocks on the boarded floor .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 9]: Dalroy crept to the trap door and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 20]: Then , during an interval between the salvoes of artillery , he heard Léontine 's voice , `` Monsieur !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 3]: Mademoiselle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: He pulled up the trap .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 12]: Beneath stood Léontine , with a long pole in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 12]: Beside her , on the floor , was a laden tray .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 13]: `` I 've brought you something to eat , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 11]: `` Father thinks you had better remain there at present .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: The Germans say they will soon cross the river , as they intend taking Liège to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 32]: Not until they had eaten some excellent rolls and butter , with boiled eggs , and drank two cups of hot coffee , did they realise how ravenously hungry they were .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 32]: Then Dalroy persuaded Irene to lie down on a pile of sacks , and , amid all the racket of a fierce engagement , she slept the sleep of sheer exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 19]: Thus he was left on guard , as it were , and saw the pontoons once more demolished .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 14]: After that he , too , curled up against the wall and slept .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 11]: The sound of rifle shots close at hand awoke him .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 13]: His first care was for the girl , but she lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 5]: Then he looked out .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 22]: There was renewed excitement in the main road , but only a few feet of it was visible from the attic .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 20]: A number of women and children ran past , all screaming , and evidently in a state of terror .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 26]: Several houses in the town were on fire , and the smoke hung over the river in such clouds as to obscure the north bank .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 9]: Old Henri Joos came hurriedly into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 15]: He was gesticulating wildly , and Dalroy heard a door bang as he vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 31]: Refusing to be penned up any longer without news of what was happening , Dalroy lowered the ladder , and , after ascertaining that Irene was still asleep , descended .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 22]: He made his way to the kitchen , pausing only to find out whether or not it held any German soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 17]: Joos 's shrill voice , raised in malediction of all Prussians , soon decided that fact .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 22]: He spoke in the local _ patois _ , but straightway branched off into French interlarded with German when Dalroy appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 5]: `` Those hogs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 4]: he almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 4]: `` Those swine-dogs !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 22]: They ca n't beat our brave boys of the 3rd Regiment , so what do you think they 're doing now ?
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 12]: Murdering men , women , and children out of mere spite .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 28]: The devils from hell pretended that the townsfolk were shooting at them , so they began to stab , and shoot , and burn in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 8]: The officers are worse than the men .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 44]: Three came here in an automobile , and marked on the gate that the mill was not to be burnt -- they want my grain , you see -- and , as they were driving off again , young Jan Smit ran by .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 9]: Poor lad , he was breathless with fear .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 18]: They asked him if he had seen another car like theirs , but he could only stutter .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 20]: One of them laughed , and said , ` I 'll work a miracle , and cure him . '
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 12]: Then he whipped out a revolver and shot the boy dead .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 10]: Some soldiers with badges on their arms saw this .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 52]: One of them yelled , ' _ Man hat geschossen _ ' -LRB- ` The people have been shooting ' -RRB- , though it was their own officer who fired , and he and the others threw little bombs into the nearest cottages , and squirted petrol in through the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 17]: Madame Didier , who has been bedridden for years , was burnt alive in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 11]: They have a regular corps of men for the job .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 34]: Then , ` to punish the town , ' as they said , they took twenty of our chief citizens , lined them up in the market-place , and fired volleys at them .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 34]: There was Dupont , and the Abbé Courvoisier , and Monsieur Philippe the notary , and -- _ ah , mon Dieu _ , I do n't know -- all my old friends .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 8]: The Prussian beasts will come here soon .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 3]: -- Wife !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 2]: Léontine !
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 6]: how can I save you ?
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 17]: They are devils -- devils , I tell you -- devils mad with drink and anger .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 14]: A few scratches in chalk on our gate wo n't hold them back .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: They may be here any moment .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 18]: You , mademoiselle , had better go with Léontine here and drown yourselves in the mill dam .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 15]: Heaven help me , that is the only advice a father can give ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 3]: Dalroy turned .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 5]: Irene stood close behind .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 13]: She knew when he left the garret , and had followed swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 19]: She confessed afterwards that she thought he meant to carry out his self-denying project , and leave her .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 31]: `` You are mistaken , Monsieur Joos , '' she said now , speaking with an aristocratic calm which had an immediate effect on the miller and his distraught womenfolk .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 9]: `` You do not know the German soldier .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 8]: He is a machine that obeys orders .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 14]: He will kill , or not kill , exactly as he is bidden .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 12]: If your house has been excepted it is absolutely safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 4]: She was right .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 16]: The mill was one of the places in Visé spared by German malice that day .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 22]: A well-defined section of the little town was given up to murder , and loot , and fire , and rapine .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 7]: Scenes were enacted which are indescribable .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 14]: A brutal soldiery glutted its worst passions on an unarmed and defenceless population .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 36]: The hour was near when some hysterical folk would tell of the apparition of angels at Mons ; but old Henri Joos was unquestionably right when he spoke of the presence of devils in Visé .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 49]: CHAPTER V BILLETS The miller 's volcanic outburst seemed to have exhausted itself ; he subsided to the oaken bench , leaned forward , elbows on knees , and thrust his clenched fists against his ears as though he would shut out the deafening clamour of the guns .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 9]: This attitude of dejection evidently alarmed Madame Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 11]: She forgot her own fears in solicitude for her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 28]: Bending over him , she patted his shoulder with a maternal hand , since every woman is at heart a mother -- a mother first and essentially .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 14]: `` Maybe the lady is right , Henri , '' she said tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 18]: `` Young as she is , she may understand these things better than countryfolk like us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 21]: `` Ah , Lise , '' he moaned , `` you would have dropped dead had you seen poor Dupont .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 10]: He wriggled for a long minute after he fell .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 9]: And the Abbé , with his white hair !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 11]: Some animal of a Prussian fired at his face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 12]: `` Do n't talk about it , '' urged his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 11]: `` It is bad for you to get so excited .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: Remember , the doctor warned you -- '' `` The doctor !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: Dr. Lafarge !
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 33]: A soldier hammered on the surgery door with the butt of his rifle , and , when the doctor came out , twirled the rifle and stabbed him right through the body .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 4]: I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 7]: It was like a conjuring trick .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 14]: I was giving an officer some figures about the contents of the mill .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 13]: The doctor screamed , and clutched at the bayonet with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 10]: And who do you think the murderer was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 22]: Madame Joos 's healthy red cheeks had turned a ghastly yellow , but she contrived to stammer , '' _ Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 5]: _ The poor doctor !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: But how should I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: `` The barber , Karl Schwartz . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 6]: `` Karl a soldier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 6]: `` More , a sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 12]: He lived and worked among us ten years -- a spy .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 13]: It was the doctor who got him fined for beating his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 15]: No wonder Monsieur Lafarge used to say there were too many Germans in Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 11]: The officer I was talking to watched the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 12]: He was a fat man , and wore spectacles for writing .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 26]: He lifted them , and screwed up his eyes , so , like a pig , to read the letters on the brass door-plate . '
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 3]: _ Almächtig !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 19]: _ ' he said , grinning , ' a successful operation on a doctor by a patient . '
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 4]: I saw red .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 9]: I felt in my pocket for a knife .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 8]: I meant to rip open his paunch .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 13]: Then one of our shells burst near us , and he scuttled .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 15]: The wind of the explosion knocked me over , so I came home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 44]: The two , to some extent , were using the local _ patois _ ; but their English hearers understood nearly every word , because these residents on the Belgian border mingle French , German , and a Low Dutch dialect almost indiscriminately .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 12]: Dalroy at once endeavoured to divert the old man 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 26]: The massacre which had been actually permitted , or even organised , in the town by daylight would probably develop into an orgy that night .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 11]: Not one woman now , but three , required protection .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 52]: He must evolve some definite plan which could be carried out during the day , because the hordes of cavalry pressing toward the Meuse would soon deplete Joos 's mill ; and when the place ceased to be of value to the commissariat the protecting order would almost certainly be revoked .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 10]: Moreover , Léontine Joos was young and fairly attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 18]: In a word , Dalroy was beginning to understand the psychology of the German soldier in war-time .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 15]: `` Let us think of the immediate future , '' he struck in boldly .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 22]: `` You have a wife and daughter to safeguard , Monsieur Joos , while I have Mademoiselle Beresford on my hands .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: Your mill is on the outskirts of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 25]: Is there no village to the west , somewhere out of the direct line , to which they could be taken for safety ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 5]: `` The west ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 17]: growled Joos , springing up again , `` is n't that where these savages are going ?
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 7]: That is the way to Liège .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 5]: I asked the officer .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 17]: He said they would be in Liège to-night , and in Paris in three weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 11]: `` Is it true that England has declared war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 5]: `` So they say .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: But the Prussians laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 19]: You have no soldiers , they tell us , and their fleet is nearly as strong as yours .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 18]: They think they have caught you napping , and that is why they are coming through Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 13]: Paris first , then the coast , and they 've got you .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 18]: For the love of Heaven , monsieur , is it true that you have no army ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 14]: Dalroy was stung into putting Britain 's case in the best possible light .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 44]: `` Not only have we an army , every man of which is worth three Germans at a fair estimate ; but if England has come into this war she will not cease fighting until Prussia grovels in the mud at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 13]: How can you , a Belgian , doubt England 's good faith ?
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: Has n't England maintained your nation in freedom for eighty years ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 5]: `` True , true !
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 25]: But the Prussians are sure of victory , and one 's heart aches when one sees them sweep over the land like a pestilence .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 15]: I have n't told you one-tenth -- '' `` Why frighten these ladies needlessly ?
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 6]: The gun-fire is bad enough .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: You and I are men , Monsieur Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 9]: We must try and save our women . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 12]: The miller was spirited , and the implied taunt struck home .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 30]: `` It 's all very well talking in that way , '' he cried ; `` but what 's going to happen to you if a German sees you ?
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 4]: _ Que diable !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 37]: _ You look like an Aachen carriage-cleaner , do n't you , with your officer air and commanding voice , and your dandy boots , and your fine clothes showing when the workman 's smock opens !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 21]: The lady , too , in a cheap shawl , wearing a blouse and skirt that cost hundreds of francs !
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 11]: -- Léontine , take monsieur -- '' `` Dalroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 25]: `` Take Monsieur Dalroy to Jan Maertz 's room , and let him put on Jan 's oldest clothes and a pair of sabots .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 9]: Jan 's clogs will just about fit him .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 10]: And give mademoiselle one of your old dresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 6]: He whirled round on Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 7]: `` What became of Jan Maertz ?
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 7]: Did the Germans really kill him ?
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 5]: Tell us the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 9]: Léontine , there , had better know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 11]: `` I think he is safe , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 17]: `` I have already explained to your daughter how the accident came about which separated us .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 21]: Maertz was pulled out of the driver 's seat by the reins when the horses plunged and upset the wagon .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: He may arrive any hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 20]: `` The Germans did n't know , then , that you and the lady were in the cart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 9]: `` I hope Jan has n't told them .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 5]: That would be awkward .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 4]: But what matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 16]: You talk like a true man , and I 'll do my best for you .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: It 's nothing but nonsense to think of getting away from Visé yet .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 18]: You 're a Liègeois whom I hired to do Jan 's work while he went to Aix .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 11]: Everybody in Visé knows he went there four days ago .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 21]: I ca n't lift heavy sacks of grain at my age , and I must have a man 's help .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 3]: You see ?
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 4]: Sharp , now .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 16]: When that fat fellow gets his puff again he 'll be here for more supplies .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 11]: And mind you do n't wash your face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 13]: You 're far too much of a gentleman as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 8]: `` One moment , '' interrupted Irene .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 20]: `` I want your promise , Captain Dalroy , that you will not go away without telling me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 24]: She could not guess how completely old Joos 's broken story of the day 's events in Visé had changed Dalroy 's intent .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 17]: `` I would as soon think of cutting off my right hand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 6]: Their eyes met and clashed .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 34]: It was dark in the mill 's kitchen , even at midday ; but the girl felt that the tan of travel and exposure on her face was yielding to a deep crimson .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 22]: `` Come , Léontine , '' she cried almost gaily , `` show me how to wear one of your frocks .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 13]: I 'll do as much for you some day in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 13]: `` You be off , too , '' growled Joos to Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 14]: `` When the Germans come they must see you about the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 9]: The old man was shrewd in his way .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 18]: The sooner these strangers became members of the household the less likely were they to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 35]: Thus it came about that both Dalroy and Irene were back in the kitchen , and clothed in garments fully in keeping with their new rôles , when a commissariat wagon entered the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 15]: A Bavarian corporal did not trouble to open the door in the ordinary way .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 8]: He smashed the latch with his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 8]: `` Why is this door closed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 4]: he demanded fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: `` Monsieur -- '' began Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 8]: `` Speak German , you swine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 9]: `` I forgot the order , Herr Kaporal .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 12]: As you see , it was only on the latch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 8]: `` Do n't let it happen again .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 12]: Load the first wagon with hay and the second with flour .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 14]: While you 're at it , these women can cook us a meal .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 8]: Where do you keep your wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 17]: `` Everything will be put on the table , _ mons _ -- Herr Kaporal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 6]: `` None of your lip !
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 14]: -- Here , you , the pretty one , show me the wine-cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 7]: I 'll make my own selection .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 18]: We Bavarians are famous judges of good wine and pretty women , let me tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 17]: The corporal 's wit was highly appreciated by the squad of four men who accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 6]: They had all been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 54]: It is a notable fact that during the early days of the invasion of Belgium and France -- in effect , while wine and brandy were procurable by theft -- the army which boasts the strictest discipline of any in the world was unquestionably the most drunken that has ever waged successful war .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 26]: Irene was `` the pretty one '' chosen as guide by this hulking connoisseur , but she knew how to handle boors of his type .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 19]: `` You must not talk in that style to a girl from Berlin , '' she said icily .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 32]: `` You and your men will take what is given you , or I 'll find your _ oberleutnant _ , and hear what he has to say about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 14]: She spoke purposely in perfect German , and the corporal was vastly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 16]: `` Pardon , _ gnädiges Fräulein _ , '' he mumbled with a clumsy bow .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 6]: `` I no offence meant .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 10]: We will within come when the meal is ready .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 5]: About -- turn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 5]: The enemy was routed .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 10]: The miller and his man worked hard until dusk .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 16]: The fat officer turned up , and lost no opportunity of ogling the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 24]: He handed Joos a payment docket , which , he explained grandiloquently , would be honoured by the military authorities in due course .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 9]: Joos pocketed the document with a sardonic grin .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 52]: There was some fifteen thousand francs ' worth of grain and forage stored on the premises , and he did not expect to see a centime of hard cash from the Germans , unless , as he whispered grimly to Dalroy , they were forced to pay double after the war .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 6]: Meanwhile the place was gutted .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 10]: Wagon after wagon came empty and went away loaded .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 6]: Driblets of news were received .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 17]: The passage of the Meuse had been achieved , thanks to a flanking movement from Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 8]: Liège had fallen at the first attack .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 24]: The German High Sea Fleet was escorting an army in transports to invade England , where , meanwhile , Zeppelins were destroying London .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 27]: Visé , having been sufficiently `` punished '' for a first offence , would now be spared so long as the inhabitants `` behaved themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 15]: If a second `` lesson '' were needed it would be something to remember .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 23]: The first and last of these items were correct , inasmuch as they represented events and definite orders affecting the immediate neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 20]: Otherwise , the budget consisted of ever more daring flights of Teutonic imagination , the crescendo swelling by distance .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 41]: Liège was so far from having fallen that the 7th Division , deprived of the support of the 9th and 10th Divisions , had been beaten back disastrously from the shallow trenches in front of the outer girdle of forts .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 37]: The 10th was about to share the same fate ; and the 9th , after being delayed nearly three days by the glorious resistance offered by the Belgians at Visé , was destined to fare likewise .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 24]: But rumour as to the instant `` capture '' of Liège was not rife among the lower ranks alone of the German army .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 33]: The commander-in-chief actually telegraphed the news to the All-Highest at Aix ; when the All-Highest discovered the truth the commander-in-chief decided that he had better blow his brains out , and did .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 61]: The fact was that the overwhelming horde of invaders could not be kept out of the city of Liège by the hastily mobilised Belgian army ; but the heroic governor , General Leman , held the ring of forts intact until they were pulverised by the heavy ordnance of which Dalroy had seen two specimens during the journey to Cologne .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 46]: Many days were destined to elapse before the last of the strongholds , Fort Loncin , crumbled into ruins by the explosion of its own magazine ; and until that was achieved the mighty army of Germany dared not advance another kilomètre to the west .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 48]: When the Bavarian corporal had gone through every part of the house and outbuildings , and satisfied himself that the only stores left were some potatoes and a half-bag of flour , he informed the miller that he and his squad would be billeted there that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 32]: `` Your pantry is bare , '' he said , `` but the wine is all right , so we 'll bring a joint which we ` planted ' this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 18]: Be decent about the wine , and your folk can have a cut in , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 20]: Possibly he meant to be civil , and there was a chance that the night might pass without incident .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 18]: Visé itself was certainly quiet save for the unceasing stream of troops making for the pontoon bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 40]: The fighting seemed to have shifted to the west and south-west , and Joos put an unerring finger on the situation when he said pithily , `` Liège is making a deuce of a row after being taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 11]: `` How many forts are there around the city ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 3]: inquired Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: `` Twelve , big and little .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 21]: Pontisse and Barchon cover the Meuse on this side , and Fleron and Evegnée bar the direct road from Aix .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 25]: Unless I am greatly in error , monsieur , the German wolf is breaking his teeth on some of them at this minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 25]: Liège itself was ten miles distant ; Pontisse , the nearest fort , though on the left bank of the river , barely six .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 29]: The evening was still , there being only a slight breeze from the south-west , which brought the loud thunder of the guns and the crackle of rifle-fire .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 18]: It was the voice of Belgium proclaiming to the high gods that she was worthy of life .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 26]: The Bavarians came with their `` joint , '' a noble piece of beef hacked off a whole side looted from a butcher 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 19]: Madame Joos cut off an ample quantity , some ten pounds , and put it in the oven .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 8]: The girls peeled potatoes and prepared cabbages .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 37]: In half-an-hour the kitchen had an appetising smell of food being cooked , the men were smoking , and a casual visitor would never have resolved the gathering into its constituent elements of irreconcilable national hatreds .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 13]: The corporal even tried to make amends for having damaged the door .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 6]: He examined the broken latch .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 12]: `` It 's a small matter , '' he said apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 27]: `` You can repair it for a trifle ; and , in any case , you will sleep all the better that we are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 19]: Though somewhat maudlin with liquor , he was very much afraid of the `` girl from Berlin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 25]: He could not sum her up , but meant to behave himself ; while his men , of course , followed his lead unquestioningly .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 6]: Dalroy kept in the background .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 8]: He listened , but said hardly anything .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: The turn of fortune 's wheel was distinctly favourable .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 56]: If the night ended as it had begun there was a chance that he and Irene might slip away to the Dutch frontier next morning , since he had ascertained definitely that Holland was secure for the time , and was impartially interning all combatants , either Germans or Belgians , who crossed the border .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 20]: At this time he was inclined to abandon his own project of striving to steal through the German lines .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 29]: He was somewhat weary , too , after the unusual labour of carrying heavy sacks of grain and flour down steep ladders or lowering them by a pulley .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 24]: Thus , he dozed off in a corner , but was aroused suddenly by the entry of the commissariat officer and three subalterns .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 20]: With them came an orderly , who dumped a laden basket and a case of champagne on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: The corporal and his satellites sprang to attention .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: The fat man took the salute , and glanced around the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 4]: Then he sniffed .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 4]: roast beef ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 13]: `` The men fare better than the officers , it would seem .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 7]: -- Be off , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 14]: `` Herr Major , we are herein billeted , '' stuttered the corporal .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 16]: `` Be off , I tell you , and take these Belgian swine with you !
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 8]: I make my quarters here to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 39]: Joos , of course , he recognised ; and the miller said , with some dignity , that the gentlemen would be made as comfortable as his resources permitted , but he must remain in his own house .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 14]: The fat man stared at him , as though such insolence were unheard-of .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 19]: `` Here , '' he roared to the corporal , `` pitch this old hog into the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 5]: He annoys me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 16]: Meanwhile , one of the younger officers , a strapping Westphalian , lurched toward Irene .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 19]: She did not try to avoid him , thinking , perhaps , that a passive attitude was advisable .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 32]: He caught her by the waist , and guffawed to his companions , `` Did n't I offer to bet you fellows that Busch never made a mistake about a woman ?
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 18]: Who 'd have dreamed of finding a beauty like this one in a rotten old mill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 15]: The Bavarians had collected their rifles and sidearms , and were going out sullenly .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 10]: Each of the officers carried a sword and revolver .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 10]: Irene saw that Dalroy had risen in his corner .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 5]: She wrenched herself free .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 19]: `` How am I to prepare supper for you gentlemen if you bother me in this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 4]: she demanded tartly .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 11]: `` Behave yourself , Fritz , '' puffed the major .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 10]: `` Is that your idea of keeping your word ?
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 23]: _ Mama _ , if she is discreet , will go to bed , and the young ones will eat with us .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 9]: -- Open that case of wine , orderly .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 4]: I 'm thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: -- The girls will have a drink too .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 5]: Cooking is warm work .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 3]: -- Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 4]: What the devil !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 10]: Kaporal , did n't you hear my order ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 10]: Dalroy grabbed Joos , who was livid with rage .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 19]: The two girls were safe for the hour , and must endure the leering of four tipsy scoundrels .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 11]: A row at the moment would be the wildest folly .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 4]: `` March ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 4]: he said gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 13]: `` The _ oberleutnant _ does n't want us here . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 26]: _ Le brave Belge _ knows when to clear out , '' grinned one of the younger men , giving Dalroy an odiously suggestive wink .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 20]: Somehow , the fact that Dalroy took command abated the women 's terror ; even the intractable Joos yielded .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 33]: Soon the two were in the yard with the dispossessed Bavarians , these latter being in the worst of temper , as they had now to search for both bed and supper .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 13]: They strode away without giving the least heed to their presumed prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 18]: Joos , like most men of choleric disposition , was useless in a crisis of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 5]: He gibbered with rage .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 12]: He wanted to attack the intruders at once with a pitchfork .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 8]: Dalroy shook him to quieten his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 12]: `` You must listen to me , '' he said sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 10]: The old man 's eyes gleamed up into his .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 14]: In the half-light of the gloaming they had the sheen of polished gold .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 13]: `` Monsieur , '' he whimpered , `` save my little girl !
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: Save her , I implore you .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 7]: You English are lions in battle .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 6]: You are big and strong .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 4]: I 'll help .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: Between us we can stick the four of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: Dalroy shook him again .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 12]: `` Stop talking , and listen , '' he growled wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 6]: `` Not another word here !
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 5]: Come this way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 20]: He drew the miller into an empty stable , whence the kitchen door and the window were in view .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 17]: `` Now , '' he muttered , `` gather your wits , and answer my questions .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 6]: Have you any hidden weapons ?
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 13]: A pitchfork is too awkward for a fight in a room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 11]: `` I had nothing but a muzzle-loading gun , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 11]: I gave it up on the advice of the burgomaster .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 6]: They 've killed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 5]: Remain here on guard .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 10]: I 'll go and fetch a rifle and bayonet .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 19]: Nothing will happen to the women till these brutes have eaten , and have more wine in them .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 5]: Do n't you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 12]: The younger men have made a hellish compact with their senior .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 9]: You heard that , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 7]: `` Yes , yes , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 9]: Who could fail to know what they meant ?
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 11]: Surely the good God sent you to Visé to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: `` Promise , now !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 13]: No interference till I return , even though the women are frightened .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 10]: You 'll only lose your life to no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 8]: I 'll not be long away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 4]: `` I promise .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 19]: But , monsieur , _ pour l'amour de Dieu _ , let me stick that fat Busch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 27]: Dalroy was in such a fume to secure a reliable arm that he rather neglected the precautions of a soldier moving through the enemy 's country .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 12]: It was still possible to see clearly for some distance ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 50]: Although the right bank of the Meuse that night was overrun with the Kaiser 's troops along a front of nearly twenty miles , the ravine , with its gurgling rivulet , was one of those peaceful oases which will occur in the centre of the most congested battlefield .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 70]: Now that the crash of the guns had passed sullenly to a distance , white-tailed rabbits scurried across the path ; some stray sheep , driven from the uplands by the day 's tumult , gathered in a group and looked inquiringly at the intruder ; a weasel , stalking a selected rabbit as is his piratical way , elected to abandon the chase and leap for a tree .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 20]: These very signs showed that none other had breasted the slope recently , so Dalroy strode out somewhat carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 33]: Nevertheless , he was endowed with no small measure of that sixth sense which every _ shikari _ must possess who would hunt either his fellowmen or the beasts of the jungle .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 17]: He was passing a dense clump of brambles and briars when a man sprang at him .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 34]: He had trained himself to act promptly in such circumstances , and had decided long ago that to remain on the same ground , or even try to retreat , was courting disaster .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 18]: His plan was to jump sideways , and , if practicable , a little nearer an assailant .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 18]: The sabots rendered him less nimble than usual , but the dodge quite disconcerted an awkward opponent .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 36]: The vicious downward sweep of a heavy cudgel just missed his left shoulder , and he got home with the right in a half-arm jab which sent the recipient sprawling and nearly into the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 16]: Dalroy made after him , seized the fallen stick , and recognised -- Jan Maertz !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 19]: `` How now , '' he said wrathfully , `` are you , too , a Prussian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 12]: Jan raised a hand to ward off the expected blow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 3]: _ Caput !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 5]: _ '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 5]: `` I 'm done !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 6]: You must be the devil !
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 17]: But may the Lord help my poor master and mistress , and the little Léontine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 12]: `` That is my wish also , sheep 's - head !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 20]: What evil have I done you , then , that you should want to brain me at sight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 9]: `` They 're after you -- the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 10]: They mean to catch you , dead or alive .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 29]: A lieutenant of the Guard pulled me away from in front of a firing-party , and gave me my life on condition that I ran you down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 6]: Here was an extraordinary development .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 39]: It was vitally important that Dalroy should get to know the exact meaning of the Walloon 's disjointed utterances , yet how could he wait and question the man while the Prussian sultans were feasting in the mill ?
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 19]: Dalroy stooped over Maertz , who had risen to his knees , and caught him by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: `` Jan Maertz , '' he said , `` do you hope to marry Léontine Joos ?
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 14]: If so , Heaven has just prevented you from committing a great crime .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 39]: She , and her mother , and the lady who came with me from Aix , are in the mill with four German officers -- a set of foul , drunken brutes who will stop at no excess .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 9]: I 'm going now to get a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 11]: You make quietly for the stable opposite the kitchen door .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 6]: You will find Joos there .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 4]: He will explain .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 14]: Tell me , are you for Belgium or Germany in this war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 17]: The Walloon might be slow-witted , but Dalroy 's words seemed to have pierced his skin .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 14]: `` For Belgium , monsieur , to the death , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: `` So am I. I 'm an Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 10]: As you go , think what that means . ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 17]: Leaving Maertz to regain his feet and the stick , Dalroy rushed on up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 28]: The unexpected struggle had cost him but little delay ; yet it was dark , and the miller was nearly frantic with anxiety , when he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: `` Is Maertz with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 5]: was his first question .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 18]: `` Yes , monsieur , '' came a gruff voice out of the gloom of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: `` Do you know now how nearly you blundered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 14]: `` Monsieur , I would have tackled St. Peter to save Léontine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 10]: hissed Joos , `` let us kill these hogs !
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 7]: We have no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 8]: The others will be here soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 5]: `` What others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 7]: `` Jan will tell you later .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 4]: Come , now .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: Leave Busch to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 5]: `` Keep quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 4]: ordered Dalroy sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: `` We can not murder four men in cold blood .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 9]: I 'll listen over there by the window .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 10]: You two remain here till I call you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 8]: But there was no need for eavesdropping .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 17]: Léontine 's voice was raised shrilly above the loud-clanging talk and laughter of the uninvited guests .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 11]: `` No , no , my mother must stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 4]: she was shrieking .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 13]: `` Monsieur , for God 's sake , leave my mother alone !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 7]: Ah , you are hurting her .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 3]: -- Father !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 2]: father !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 8]: -- Oh , what shall we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 9]: Is there no one to help us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 34]: CHAPTER VI THE FIGHT IN THE MILL As Dalroy burst open the door , which was locked , the heartrending screams of the three women mingled with the vile oaths of their assailants .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 26]: He had foreseen that the door would probably be fastened , and put his whole strength into the determination to force the bolt without warning .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 30]: The scene which met his eyes as he rushed into the room was etched in Rembrandt lights and shadows by a lamp placed in the centre of the table .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 40]: Near a staircase -- not that which led to the lofts , but the main stairway of the domestic part of the dwelling -- Madame Joos was struggling in the grip of the orderly and one of the lieutenants .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 22]: Another of these heroes -- they all belonged to a Westphalian detachment of the commissariat -- was endeavouring to overpower Irene .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 30]: His left arm pinned her left arm to her waist ; his right arm had probably missed a similar hold , because the girl 's right arm was free .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 21]: She had seized his wrist , and was striving to ward off a brutal effort to prevent her from shrieking .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 9]: Busch , that stout satyr , was seated .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: Dalroy learnt subsequently that the sudden hubbub arose because Irene resisted his attempt to pull her on to his knee .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 30]: The last of the younger men was clasping Léontine to his breast with rascally intent to squeeze the breath out of her until she was unable to struggle further .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 24]: Now Dalroy had to decide in the fifth part of a second whence danger would first come , and begin the attack there .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 18]: The four officers had laid aside their swords , but the lieutenants had retained belts and revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 18]: Busch , as might be expected , was only too pleased to get rid of his equipment .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 13]: His tunic was unbuttoned , so that he might gorge at ease .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 19]: Somehow , Dalroy knew that Irene would not free the hand which was now closing on her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 46]: The two Walloons carried short forks with four prongs -- Joos had taken to heart the Englishman 's comment on the disadvantage of a pitchfork for close fighting -- and Jan Maertz might be trusted to deal with the ruffian who was nearly strangling Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 35]: There remained the gallant lieutenant whose sense of humour permitted the belief that the best way to force onward a terrified elderly woman was to plant a knee against the small of her back .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 26]: He had looked around at once when the door flew open , and his right hand was already on the butt of an automatic pistol .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 24]: Him , therefore , Dalroy bayoneted so effectually that a startled oath changed into a dreadful howl ere the words left his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 40]: The orderly happened to be nearer than the officer , so , as the bayonet did its work , Dalroy kicked the lout 's feet from under him , and thrust him through the body while on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 58]: A man who had once won the Dholepur Cup , which is competed for by the most famous pig-stickers in India , knew how to put every ounce of weight behind the keen point of a lance , because an enraged boar is the quickest and most courageous fighter among all the fierce creatures of the jungle .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 27]: But he was slightly too near his quarry ; the bayonet reached the stone floor through the man 's body , and snapped at the forte .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 11]: Then he wheeled , and made for Irene 's assailant .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 32]: The instant Dalroy appeared at the door the girl had caught the Prussian 's thumb in her strong teeth , and not only bit him to the bone but held on .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 8]: With a loud bellow of `` Help !
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 4]: Come quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 12]: he released her , and struck fiercely with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 43]: Yet this gentle girl , who had never taken part in any more violent struggle than a school romp , had the presence of mind to throw herself backward , and thus discount the blow , while upsetting her adversary 's balance .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 9]: But her clenched teeth did not let go .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 12]: It came out long afterwards that she was a first-rate gymnast .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 53]: One day , moved by curiosity on seeing some performance in a circus , she had essayed the stage trick of hanging head downward from a cross-bar , and twirling around another girl 's body girdled by a strap working on a swivel attached to a strong pad which she bit resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 14]: Then she discovered a scientific fact which very few people are aware of .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 28]: The jaw is , perhaps , the strongest part of the human frame , and can exercise a power relatively far greater than that of the hands .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 26]: Of course , she could not have held out for long , but she did thwart and delay the maddened Prussian during two precious seconds .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 19]: Even when he essayed to choke her she still contrived to save herself by seizing his free hand .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 10]: By that time Dalroy had leaped to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 25]: Shortening the rifle in the way familiar to all who have practised the bayonet exercise , he drove it against the Prussian 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 34]: The jagged stump inflicted a wound which looked worse than it was ; but the mere shock of the blow robbed the man of his senses , and he fell like a log .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 15]: In order to come within striking distance , Dalroy had to jump over Busch .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 29]: Old Joos , piping in a weird falsetto , had sprung at the fat major and spitted him in the stomach with all four prongs of the fork .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 23]: Busch toppled over backward with a fearsome howl , the chair breaking under his weight combined with a frantic effort to escape .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 25]: The miller went with him , and dug the terrible weapon into his soft body as though driving it into a truss of straw .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 31]: Maertz , a lusty fellow , had made shorter work of his man , because one prong had reached the German 's heart , and he was stilled at once .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 19]: But Joos thrust and thrust again , even using a foot to bury the fork to its shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 11]: This was the most ghastly part of a thrilling episode .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 28]: Busch writhed on the floor , screaming shrilly for mercy , and striving vainly to stay with his hands the deadly implement from eating into his vitals .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 10]: That despairing effort gave the miller a ghoulish satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 9]: he chortled , `` you laughed at Lafarge !
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 6]: Laugh now , you swine !
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 35]: _ That 's _ for the doctor , and _ that 's _ for my wife , and _ that 's _ for my daughter , and _ that 's _ for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: Dalroy did not attempt to stop him .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 5]: These men must die .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 20]: They had come to the mill to destroy ; it was just retribution that they themselves should be destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 18]: His coolness in this crisis was not the least important factor in a situation rife with peril .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 19]: His method of attack had converted a fight against heavy odds into a speedy and most effectual slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 7]: But that was only the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 23]: Even while the frenzied yelling of the squirming Busch was subsiding into a frothy gurgle he went to the door and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 23]: A battery of artillery was passing at a trot , and creating din enough to drown the cries of a hundred Busches .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 7]: He looked back over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 9]: Madame Joos was on her knees , praying .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 14]: The poor woman had no thought but that her last hour had come .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 13]: Happily , she was spared the sight of her husband 's vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 10]: Happily , too , none of the women fainted .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 10]: Léontine was panting and sobbing in Maertz 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 29]: Irene , leaning against the wall near the fireplace , was gazing now at Joos , now at the fallen man at her feet , now at Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 8]: But her very soul was on fire .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 14]: She , too , had yielded to the madness of a life-and-death struggle .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 5]: Her eyes were dilated .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: Her bosom rose and fell with laboured breathing .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 21]: Her teeth were still clenched , her lips parted as though she dreaded to find some loathsome taste on them .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 14]: Maertz seemed to have retained his senses , so Dalroy appealed to him .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 15]: `` Jan , '' he said quietly , `` we must go at once .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 8]: Get your master and the others outside .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 5]: Then extinguish the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 2]: Hurry !
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 9]: We have n't a second to spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 3]: Joos heard .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 26]: Satisfied now that the fork had been effective , he straightened his small body and said shrilly , `` You go , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 13]: I 'll not leave my money to be burnt with my house .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 8]: -- Now , wife , stir yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 6]: Where 's that key ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 12]: The familiar voice roused Madame Joos from a stupor of fear .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 18]: She fumbled in her bodice , and produced a key attached to a chain of fine silver .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 44]: Her husband mounted nimbly on a chair , ran a finger along one of the heavy beams which roofed the kitchen , found a cunningly hidden keyhole , and unlocked a long , narrow receptacle which had been scooped out of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 17]: A more ingenious , accessible , yet unlikely hiding-place for treasure could not readily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 16]: He took out a considerable sum of money in notes , gold , and silver .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 27]: Though a man of wealth , with a substantial account in the state bank , he still retained the peasant 's love of a personal hoard .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 15]: Stowing away the money in various pockets , Joos got down off the chair .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 10]: Busch was dying , but he was not unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 26]: He had even watched the miller 's actions with a certain detached curiosity , and the old fellow seemed to become aware of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 14]: `` So , '' he cackled , `` you saw , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 13]: That should annoy you in your last hour , you fat thief .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: -- Yes , yes , monsieur , I 'll come now .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 20]: -- Léontine , stop blubbing , and tie up that piece of beef and some bread in a napkin .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: We fighting men must eat .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 15]: -- Jan , put the bottles of champagne and the pork-pie in a basket .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 15]: -- Léontine , run and get your own and your mother 's best shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 9]: You can change them in the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 5]: `` What wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 4]: put in Maertz .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 16]: `` We ca n't walk to Maestricht by the main road , you fool . ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 17]: `` That 's all right for you and madame here , and for Léontine , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 6]: But I remain in Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 16]: My friends are fighting yonder at Liège , and I 'm going to join them .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: And these others must n't try it .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 7]: The frontier is closed for them .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 15]: I was offered my life only two hours ago if I arrested them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 4]: `` Jan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 4]: cried Léontine indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 5]: `` It 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 7]: Why should I tell a lie ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 14]: I did n't understand then the sort of game the Prussians are playing .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 36]: Now that I know -- '' `` Miss Beresford , '' broke in Dalroy emphatically , `` if these good people will not escape when they may we must leave them to their fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 20]: `` Do come , Monsieur Joos , '' said Irene , speaking for the first time since the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 13]: `` By remaining here you risk your life to no purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 12]: `` We are coming now , ma 'm ` selle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 25]: Suddenly the miller 's alert eye was caught by a spasmodic movement in the limbs of the last man whom Dalroy struck down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 3]: _ Tiens !
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 15]: _ '' he cried , `` that fellow is n't finished with yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 20]: He was making for the prostrate form with that terrible fork when Dalroy ran swiftly , and collared him .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 5]: `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 5]: came the angry command .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 10]: `` A fair fight must not degenerate into murder .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 13]: Out you get now , or I 'll throw you out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 3]: Joos laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 13]: `` You 're making a mistake , monsieur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 9]: `` These Prussians do n't fight that way .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 19]: They 'd kill you just for the fun of the thing if you were tied hand and foot .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 10]: But let the rascal live if it pleases you .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 21]: As for this one , '' and he spurned Busch 's body with his foot , `` he 's done .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 5]: Did you hear him ?
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 7]: He squealed like a pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 39]: Dalroy was profoundly relieved when the automatic pistols and ammunition were collected , the lamp extinguished , the door closed , and the whole party had passed through a garden and orchard to the gloom of the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 8]: The hour was about half-past eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 34]: Twenty-four hours earlier he and Irene were about to leave Cologne by train , believing with some degree of confidence that they might be allowed to cross the frontier without let or hindrance !
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 11]: Life was then conventional , with a spice of danger .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 28]: Now it had descended in the social scale until they ranked on a par with the dog that had gone mad and must be slain at sight .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 25]: The German code of war is a legal paraphrase of the trickster 's formula , `` Heads I win , tails you lose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 38]: The armies of the Fatherland are ordered to practise `` frightfulness , '' and so terrorise the civil population that the inhabitants of the stricken country will compel their rulers to sue for peace on any terms .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 24]: But woe to that same civil population if some small section of its members resists or avenges any act of `` frightfulness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 48]: Soldiers might murder the Widow Jaquinot and ravish her granddaughter , officers might plan a bestial orgy in the miller 's house ; but Dalroy and Joos and Maertz , in punishing the one set of crimes and preventing another , had placed themselves outside the law .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 27]: Neither Joos nor Maertz cared a farthing rushlight about the moral consequences of that deadly struggle in the kitchen , but Dalroy was in different case .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 6]: He knew the certain outcome .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 12]: Small wonder if his heart was heavy and his brow seamed .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 39]: His own fate was of slight concern , since he had ceased to regard life as worth more than an hour 's purchase at any time from the moment he leaped down into the station yard at Aix-la-Chapelle .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 24]: But it was hard luck that the accident of mere association should have bound up Irene Beresford 's fortunes so irrevocably with his .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 14]: Was there no way out of the maze in which they were wandering ?
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 14]: What , for instance , had Jan Maertz meant by his cryptic statements ?
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 57]: `` We must halt here , '' Dalroy said authoritatively , stopping short in the shadow of a small clump of trees on the edge of the ravine , a place whence there was a fair field of view , yet so close to dense brushwood that the best of cover was available instantly if needed .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 3]: demanded Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: `` I know every inch of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 12]: `` I want to question Maertz , '' said Dalroy shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 12]: `` But do n't let me delay you on that account .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 17]: Indeed , I advise you to go ahead , and safeguard Madame Joos and your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 17]: I would even persuade , if I can , Mademoiselle Beresford to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 17]: `` I do n't mind listening to Jan 's yarn myself , '' grunted the miller .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 11]: `` And is n't it time we had some supper ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 6]: Killing Prussians is hungry work .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 5]: Did you hear Busch ?
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 6]: He squealed like a pig .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 21]: -- Léontine , cut some chunks of beef and bread , and open one of these bottles of wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: There was solid sense in the old man 's crude rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 13]: Criminals about to suffer the death penalty often enjoy a good meal .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 49]: These six people , who had just escaped death , or -- where the women were concerned -- a degradation worse than death , and before whose feet the grave might yawn wide and deep at once and without warning , were nevertheless greatly in want of food .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 7]: So they ate as they talked .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 12]: Maertz 's story was coherent enough when set forth in detail .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 50]: He was dazed and shaken by the fall from the wagon ; but , helped by the sentry , who bore witness that the collision was no fault of his , being the outcome of obedience to the officer 's order , he contrived to calm the startled horses .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 37]: The officer even offered to find a few men later who would help to pull the wagon out of the ditch , so Jan was told to `` stand by '' until the column had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 13]: Meaning no harm , he asked what had become of his passengers .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 26]: This naturally evoked other questions , and a search was made , with the result that the lamp and Dalroy 's discarded sabots were found .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 60]: The lamp , of course , was numbered , and carried the initials of a German state railway ; but this `` exhibit '' only bore out Maertz 's statement that a man from Aix had come in the wagon to explain to Joos why the consignment of oats had been so long held up in the goods yard .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 32]: In fact , a squad of soldiers had put the wagon right , and were reloading it , when the bodies of Heinrich and his companion were discovered in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 9]: Suspicion fell at once on the missing pair .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 40]: Maertz would have been shot out of hand if an infuriated officer had not recollected that by killing the Walloon he would probably destroy all chance of tracing the man who had `` murdered '' two of his warriors .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 26]: So Maertz was arrested , and dumped into a cellar until such time as a patrol could take him to Visé and investigate matters there .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 28]: Meanwhile the unforeseen resistance offered to the invaders along the line of the Meuse and neighbourhood of Liège was throwing the German military machine out of gear .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 40]: In this initial stage of the campaign `` the best organised army in the world '' was like a powerful locomotive engine fitted with every mechanical device for rapid advance , but devoid of either brakes or reversing gear .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 31]: As the 7th and 10th Divisions recoiled from the forts of Liège in something akin to disastrous defeat , congestion and confusion spread backward to the advanced base at Aix .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 18]: Hospital trains from the front compelled other trains laden with reserves and munitions to remain in sidings .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 5]: The roads became blocked .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 19]: Brigades of infantry and cavalry , long lines of guns and wagons , were halted during many hours .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 24]: Frantic staff-officers in powerful cars were alternately urging columns to advance and demanding a clear passage to the rear and the headquarters staff .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 10]: No regimental commandant dared think and act for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 16]: He was merely a cog in the machine , and the machine had broken down .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 47]: Actually , the defenders of Liège held up the Kaiser 's legions only a few days , but it is no figure of speech to say that when General Leman dropped stupefied by an explosion in Fort Loncin he had established a double claim to immortality .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 27]: Not only had he shattered the proud German legend of invincibility in the field , but he had also struck a deadly blow at German strategy .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 28]: With Liège and Leman out of the way , it would seem to the student of war that the invaders must have reached Paris early in September .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 30]: They made tremendous strides later in the effort to maintain their `` time-table , '' but they could never overtake the days lost in the valley of the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 13]: What a tiny pawn was Jan Maertz in this game of giants !
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 17]: How little could he realise that his very existence depended on the shock of opposing empires !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 23]: The communications officer at the cross-roads had not a moment to spare for many an hour after Jan 's execution was deferred .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 21]: At last , about nightfall , when the 9th Division got into motion again , he snatched a slight breathing-space .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 26]: Remembering the prisoner , he detailed a corporal and four men to march him to Visé and make the necessary inquiries at Joos 's mill .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 11]: For Maertz 's benefit he gave the corporal precise instructions .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 40]: `` If this fellow 's story is proved true , and you find the man and the woman he says he brought from Aachen , return here with the three of them , and full investigation will be made .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 29]: If no such man and woman have arrived at the mill , and the prisoner is shown to be a liar , shoot him out of hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 37]: A young staff-officer , a lieutenant of the Guards , stretching his legs while his chauffeur was refilling the petrol-tank , overheard the loud-voiced order , and took a sudden and keen interest in the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 23]: `` One moment , '' he said imperatively , `` what 's this about a man and a woman brought from Aachen ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 4]: Who brought them ?
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 4]: And when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 21]: The other explained , laying stress , of course , on the fractured skulls of two of his best men .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 6]: `` Hi , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 12]: cried the Guardsman to Maertz , `` describe these two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 5]: Maertz did his best .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 22]: Dalroy , to him , was literally a railway employé ; but his recollection of Irene 's appearance was fairly exact .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 16]: Moreover , he was quite reasonably irritated and alarmed by the trouble they had caused .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 14]: Then the lamp and sabots were produced , and the questioner swore mightily .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 15]: `` Leave this matter entirely in my hands , '' he advised his confrère .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 22]: `` It is most important that these people should be captured , and this is the very fellow to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 34]: I 'll promise him his life , and the safety of his friends , and pay him well into the bargain , if he helps me to get hold of that precious pair .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 18]: You see , we shall have no difficulty in catching and identifying him again if need be .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 27]: Personally , I believe he is telling the absolute truth , and is no more responsible for the killing of your men than you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 13]: Lieutenant Karl von Halwig 's comparison erred only in its sheer inadequacy .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 8]: The communications officer 's responsibility was great .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: He had failed to control his underlings .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 9]: He was blind and deaf to their excesses .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 15]: What matter how they treated the wretched Belgians if the road was kept clear ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 25]: It was nothing to him that an old woman should be murdered and a girl outraged so long as he kept his squad intact .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 15]: `` So now you know all about it , monsieur , '' concluded Maertz .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 20]: `` When I met you in the ravine I thought you were escaping , and let out at you .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 12]: God be praised , you got the better of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 11]: `` Was the staff officer 's name Von Halwig ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 3]: inquired Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 12]: `` Name of a pipe , that 's it , monsieur !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 17]: I heard him tell it to the other pig , but could n't recall it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 10]: `` And when were you to meet him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 22]: `` He had to report to some general at Argenteau , but reckoned to reach the mill about nine o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: `` Oh , father dear , let us all be going ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 3]: pleaded Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 15]: `` One more word , and I have finished , '' put in Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 6]: He turned again to Maertz .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 18]: `` What did you mean by saying a little while ago that the frontier is closed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 10]: `` The lieutenant -- Von Halwig , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 16]: -- sent some Uhlans to the major of a regiment guarding the line opposite Holland .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 19]: He wrote a message , but I know what was in it because he told the other officer .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 29]: ` They 're making for the frontier , ' he said , ` and if they have n't slipped through already we 'll catch them now without fail .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 26]: They must n't get away this time if we have to arrest and examine every -- Belgian in this part of the country . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 3]: ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 24]: piped Joos , who had listened intently to Jan 's recital , `` why did n't you tell us that sooner , animal ?
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 18]: What chance , then , have I and madame and Léontine of dodging the rascals ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 3]: _ Caput !
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 14]: _ '' cried Maertz , scratching his head , `` that settles it !
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 7]: I never thought of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 6]: `` Oh , look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 3]: whispered Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 8]: `` They 're searching the mill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 20]: So earnest and vital was the talk that none of the others had chanced to look down the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 15]: They saw now that lights were moving in the upper rooms of the mill .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 25]: Either Von Halwig had arrived before time , or some messenger had tried to find the commissariat officers , and had raised an alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 15]: Joos took charge straight away , like the masterful old fellow that he was .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 14]: `` This locality is n't good for our health , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 21]: `` The night is young yet , but we must leg it to a safer place before we begin planning .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 4]: Leave nothing behind .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 7]: We may need all that food .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 27]: -- Come , Lise , '' and he grabbed his wife 's arm , `` you and I will lead the way to the Argenteau wood .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 12]: The devil himself ca n't track me once I get there .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 12]: -- Trust me , monsieur , I 'll pull you through .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 13]: That lout , Jan Maertz , is all muscle and no brain .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 11]: What Léontine sees in him I ca n't guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 16]: For the time being , Dalroy believed that the miller might prove a resourceful guide .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 37]: Before deciding the course he personally would pursue it was absolutely essential that he should learn the lay of the land and weigh the probabilities of success or failure attached to such alternatives as were suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 15]: `` We had better go with our friends , '' he said to Irene .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 23]: `` They know the country , and I must have time for consideration before striking out a line of my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: `` I think it would be fatal to separate , '' she agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 19]: `` When all is said and done , what can they hope to accomplish without your help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 12]: Joos 's voice came to them in eager if subdued accents .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: He was telling his wife how accounts were squared with Busch .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 21]: `` I stuck him with the fork , '' he chortled , `` and he squealed like a pig ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 14]: CHAPTER VII THE WOODMAN 'S HUT The miller was cunning as a fox .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 48]: He argued , subtly enough , that if a man just arrived from Argenteau was the first to discover the dead Prussians , the neighbourhood of Argenteau itself might be the last to undergo close search for the `` criminals '' who had dared punish these demi-gods .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 20]: Following a cattle-path through a series of fields , he entered a country lane about a mile from Visé .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 27]: It was a narrow , deep-rutted , winding way -- a shallow trench cut into the soil by many generations of pack animals and heavy carts .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 24]: The long interregnum between the solid pavement of Rome and the broken rubble of Macadam covered Europe with a network of such roads .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 22]: An unchecked growth of briars , brambles , and every species of prolific weed made this particular track an ideal hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 46]: Gathering the party under the two irregular lines of pollard oaks which marked the otherwise hardly discernible hedgerows , Joos explained that , at a point nearly half-a-mile distant , the lane joined the main road which winds along the right bank of the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 18]: `` That is our only real difficulty -- the crossing of the road , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 32]: `` It is sure to be full of Germans ; but if we watch our chance we should contrive to scurry from one side to the other without being seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 6]: Such confidence was unquestionably cheering .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 33]: Even Dalroy , though he put a somewhat sceptical question , did not really doubt that the old man was adopting what might , in the circumstances , prove the best plan .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 15]: `` What happens when we do reach the other side , Monsieur Joos ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 14]: `` Then we enter a disused quarry in the depths of a wood .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 25]: The Meuse nearly surrounds the wood , and there is barely room for a tow-path between the river 's edge and a steep cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 22]: The quarry forms the landward face , as one may say , and among the trees is a woodman 's hut .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 12]: I shall be surprised if we find any Germans there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 20]: `` From your description it seems to be a suitable post for a strong picket watching the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 5]: `` No , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: The slope falls away from the river , while the opposite bank is flat and open .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: I have been a soldier in my time , and I understand these things .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 36]: It would be all right for observation purposes if these pigs had n't seized the bridge-heads at Visé and Argenteau ; but I saw their cursed Uhlans on the left bank many hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: `` Lead on , friend , '' said Dalroy simply .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 18]: `` When we come within a hundred mètres of the main road let me do the scouting .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 11]: I 'll tell you when and how to advance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: `` Is monsieur a soldier then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 6]: `` An officer perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 13]: `` Ah , a thousand pardons if I presumed to lecture you .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: Yet I am certainly in the right about the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 10]: `` I have never doubted you , Monsieur Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 10]: Do you know what time the moon rises ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 3]: `` Late .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 7]: Eleven o'clock at the earliest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 14]: `` All the better , if you are sure of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 7]: `` I could find it blindfolded .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 4]: So could Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 8]: She goes there to pick bilberries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 7]: The homely phrase was unconsciously dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 21]: From the highroad came the raucous singing of German soldiers , the falsetto of drunkards with an ear for music .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 24]: In the distance heavy artillery was growling , and high explosive shells were bursting with a violence that seemed to rend the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 36]: Over an area of many miles to the west the sharp tapping of musketry and the staccato splutter of machine guns told of hundreds of thousands of men engaged in a fierce struggle for supremacy .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 14]: On every hand the horizon was red with the glare of burning houses .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 26]: The thought of a village girl picking bilberries in a land so scarred by war and rapine produced an effect at once striking and fantastic .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 19]: It was as though a ray of pure white light had pierced the lurid depths of a volcano .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 25]: Dalroy advised the women to take off their linen aprons , and Madame Joos to remove as well a coif of the same material .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 11]: He unfastened and threw away the stump of the bayonet .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 12]: Then they moved on in Indian file , the miller leading .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 27]: A definite quality of blackness loomed above the low-lying shroud of mist which at night in still weather always marks the course of a great river .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 5]: `` The wood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 3]: whispered Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 9]: `` We are near the road now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 9]: Dalroy went forward to spy out the conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 7]: A column of infantry was passing .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 9]: These fellows were silent , and therefore sinister .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 16]: They marched like tired men , and their shuffling feet raised a cloud of dust .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 6]: An officer lighted a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 28]: `` Those guzzling Prussians would empty the Meuse if it ran with wine , '' he growled , evidently in response to a remark from a companion .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 21]: `` Our brigadier was very angry about the broken bottles in the streets of Argenteau , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 18]: `` Two tires were ruined before the chauffeur realised that the place was littered with glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 12]: These were Saxons , cleaner-minded , manlier fellows than the Prussians .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 10]: Behind them Dalroy heard the rumble of commissariat wagons .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 17]: He failed utterly to understand the why and wherefore of the direction the troops were taking .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: According to his reckoning , they should have been going the opposite way .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 11]: But that was no concern of his at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 39]: He knew the Saxon by repute , and hurried back to the two men and three women crouching under a hedge , having already noted a little mound on the left of the cross-roads where cover was available .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 52]: He explained what they were to do -- steal forward , one by one , hide behind the mound , and dart across when a longer space than usual separated one wagon from another , as the mounted escort would probably be grouped in front and in rear of the convoy .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 12]: `` Ah , that is the cavalry , '' said Joos .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 11]: `` It stands on a rock by the roadside . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 17]: `` It is hard to distinguish anything owing to mist and dust , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 12]: `` Of course , the darkness is all to the good .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 33]: -- If you ladies do not scream , whatever happens , and you run quickly when I give the word , I do n't think there will be any real danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 20]: In the event , they were able to cross the road in a body , and without needless haste .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 20]: A horse stumbled and fell , and had to be unharnessed before being got on to its feet again .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 41]: The incident held up the column during some minutes , so Dalroy was not compelled to abandon the rifle , which it would have been foolish in the extreme to carry if there was the slightest chance of being seen .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 22]: Thenceforth progress was safe , though slow and difficult , because the gloom beneath the trees was that of a vault .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 16]: Even the miller perforce yielded place to Léontine 's young eyes and sureness of foot .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 34]: There were times , during the ascent of one side of the quarry , when whispered directions were necessary , while Madame Joos had to be hauled up a few awkward places bodily .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 24]: Still , they reached the hut , a mere logger 's shed , but a veritable haven for people so manifestly in peril .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 6]: They were weary , too .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 25]: No member of the Joos household had slept throughout the whole of Tuesday night , and the women especially were flagging under the strain .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 20]: The little cabin held an abundant store of shavings , because its normal tenant rough-hewed his logs into sabots .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 14]: Here , then , was a soft , warm , and fragrant resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 4]: Dalroy took command .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 8]: He forbade talking , even in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 18]: Maertz , who promised to keep awake , was put on guard outside till the moon rose .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 24]: The wisdom of preventing excited conversation was shown by the fact that the five people huddled together on the shavings were soon asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 7]: There was nothing strange in this .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 13]: Humanity , when surfeited with emotion , becomes calm , almost phlegmatic .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 19]: Were it otherwise , after a week of war soldiers would not be sane men , but maniacs .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 8]: Dalroy resolved to sleep for two hours .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 36]: About eleven o'clock he got up , went quietly to the door , and found Maertz seated on the ground , his back propped against the wall , and his head sunk on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 9]: As a consequence , he was snoring melodiously .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 36]: He woke quickly enough when the Englishman 's hand was clapped over his mouth and held there until his torpid wits were sufficiently clear that he should understand the stern words muttered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 10]: `` Pardon , monsieur , '' he said shamefacedly .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 11]: `` I thought there was no harm in sitting down .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 11]: I listened to the guns , and began counting them .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 29]: I counted one hundred and ninety-nine shots , I think , and then -- '' `` And then you risked six lives , Léontine 's among them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 9]: `` Monsieur , I have no excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 11]: `` Yet you have been a soldier , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 9]: And you gabble of serving your country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 10]: `` It will not happen again , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 10]: Dalroy pretended an anger he did not really feel .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 23]: He wanted this stolid Walloon to remain awake now , at any rate , so turned away with an ejaculation of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 3]: Maertz rose .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 10]: He endured an eloquent silence for nearly a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 15]: Then he murmured , `` Monsieur , I shall not offend a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 12]: Counting guns is worse than watching sheep jumping a fence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 15]: The moon had risen , revealing a cleared space in front of the hut .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 30]: A dozen yards away a thin fringe of brushwood and small trees marked the edge of the quarry , while the woodcutter 's path was discernible on the left .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 46]: A slight breeze had called into being the myriad tongues of the wood , and Dalroy realised that the unceasing cannonade , joined to the rustling of the leaves , would drown any sound of an approaching enemy until it was too late to retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 52]: He knew that Von Halwig , not to mention the military authorities at Visé , would spare no effort to hunt out and destroy the man who had dared to flout the might of Germany , so he was far from satisfied with the apparent safety of even this secluded refuge .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 12]: `` Have you a piece of string in your pockets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 4]: he demanded gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 17]: Trust a carter to carry string , strong stuff warranted to mend temporarily a broken strap .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 6]: Maertz gave him a quantity .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 12]: `` I am going to the cross-road , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 9]: `` Keep a close watch till I return .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 17]: When you hear any movement , or see any one , say clearly ` Visé . '
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 12]: If it is I , I shall answer ` Liège . '
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 5]: Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 5]: `` Perfectly , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 7]: A challenge and a countersign . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 9]: Dalroy believed the man might be trusted now .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 21]: Taking the rifle , he made off along the path , treading as softly as the cumbrous sabots would permit .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 22]: He was tempted to go bare-footed , but dreaded the lameness which might result from a thorn or a sharp rock .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 54]: At a suitable place , half-way down the steep path by the side of the quarry , he tied a pistol to a stout sapling , and , having fastened a cord to the trigger , arranged it in such fashion that it must catch the feet of any one coming that way .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 22]: The weapon was at full cock , and in all likelihood the unwary passer-by would get a bullet in his body .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 28]: It was dark under the trees , of course , but the moon was momentarily increasing its light , and the way was not hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 17]: He memorised each awkward turn and twist in case he had to retreat in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 30]: Once the lower level was reached there was no difficulty , and , with due precautions , he gained the shelter of a hedge close to the main road .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 7]: The stream of troops still continued .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 14]: Few things could be more ominous than this unending torrent of armed men .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 18]: By how many similar roads , he wondered , was Germany pouring her legions into tiny Belgium ?
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 12]: Was she forcing the French frontier in the same remorseless way ?
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 5]: And what of Russia ?
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 16]: When he left Berlin the talk was only of marching against the two great allies .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 49]: If Germany could spare such a host of horse , foot , and artillery for the overrunning of Belgium , while moving the enormous forces needed on both flanks , what millions of men she must have placed under arms long before the mobilisation order was announced publicly !
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 8]: And what was England doing and saying ?
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 2]: England !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 51]: the home of liberty and a free press , where demagogues spouted platitudes about the `` curse of militarism , '' and encouraged that very monster by leaving the richest country in the world open to just such a sudden and merciless attack as Belgium was undergoing before his eyes !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 41]: Lying there among the undergrowth , listening to the tramp of an army corps , and watching the flicker of countless rifle-barrels in the moonlight , he forgot his own plight , and thought only of the unpreparedness of Britain .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 9]: He was a soldier by training and inclination .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 5]: He harboured no delusions .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 24]: Man for man , the alert , intelligent , and chivalrous British army was far superior to the cannon-fodder of the German machine .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 26]: But of what avail was the hundred thousand Britain could put in the field in the west of Europe against the four millions of Germany ?
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 18]: Here was no combat of a David and a Goliath , but of one man against forty .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 42]: Naturally , France and Russia came into the picture , yet he feared that France would break at the outset of the campaign , while Austria might hold Russia in check long enough to enable Germany to work her murderous design .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 21]: Be it remembered , he could not possibly estimate the fine and fierce valour of the resistance offered by Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 44]: It seemed to him that the Teuton hordes must already be hacking their way to the coast , leaving sufficient men and guns to contain the Belgian fortresses , and halting only when the white cliffs of England were visible across the Channel .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 52]: If his anxious thoughts wandered , however , and a gnawing doubt ate into his soul lest the British fleet might , as the Germans in Visé claimed , have been taken at a disadvantage , he did not allow his eyes and ears to neglect the duties of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 26]: A fall in the temperature had condensed the river mist , and the air near the ground was much clearer now than at eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 25]: The breeze , too , gathered the dust into wraiths and scurrying wisps through which glimpses of the sloping uplands toward Aix were obtainable .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 21]: During one of these unhampered moments he caught sight of something so weird and uncanny that he was positively startled .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 18]: A sorrow-laden , waxen-hued face seemed to peer at him for an instant , and then vanish .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 35]: But there could be no face so high in the air , twenty feet or more above the heads of a Prussian regiment bawling '' _ Deutschland , Deutschland , über alles _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 7]: The land was level XXXX thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 14]: The apparition , consequently , must be a mere trick of the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 39]: Yet he saw , or fancied he saw , that same spectral face twice again at intervals of a few seconds , and was vexed with himself for allowing his bemused senses to yield to some supernatural influence .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 19]: Then the vision came a fourth time , and a thrill ran through every fibre in his body .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 8]: Because there could be no mistake now .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 21]: The face , so mournful , so benign , so pitying , bore on the forehead a crown of thorns !
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 30]: Even while the blood coursed in Dalroy 's veins with the awe of it , he knew that he was looking at the figure of Christ on the Cross .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 19]: This , then , was the calvary spoken of by Joos , and invisible in the earlier murk .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 17]: The beams of the risen moon etched the painted carving in most realistic lights and shadows .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 9]: The pallid skin glistened as though in agony .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 26]: The big , piercing eyes gazed down at the passing soldiers as the Man of Sorrows might have looked at the heedless legionaries of Rome .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 61]: The travelled Briton , to whom the wayside calvary is a familiar object in many a continental landscape , can seldom pass the twisted , tortured figure on the Cross without a feeling of awe , tempered by insular non-comprehension of the religious motive which thrusts into prominence the most solemn emblem of Christianity in unexpected and often incongruous places .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 48]: Seen as Dalroy saw it , a hunted fugitive crouching in a ditch , while the Huns who would again destroy Europe were lurching past in thousands within a few feet of where he lay , the image of Christ crucified had a new and overwhelming significance .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 12]: It induced a vague uneasiness of spirit , almost a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 25]: That very day he had killed four men and gravely wounded a fifth , and there was no shred of compunction in his soul .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 43]: Yet , in body and mind , he was worthy of his class , and this gray old world has failed to evolve any finer human type than that which is summed up in the phrase , an officer and a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 63]: For the foulest of crimes , either committed or contemplated , he had been forced to use both the scales and the sword of justice ; but there was something wholly disturbing and abhorrent in the knowledge that two thousand years after the Great Atonement men professedly Christian should so wantonly disregard every principle that Christ taught and practised and died for .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 20]: He reflected bitterly that the German soldier , whether officer or private , is enjoined to keep a diary .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 33]: What sort of record would `` Heinrich , '' or Busch , or the three Westphalian lieutenants have left of that day 's doings if they had lived and told the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 16]: The answer to these vexed questionings came with the swift clarity of a lightning flash .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 22]: Another rift in the dust-clouds revealed the upper part of the Cross , and the moonbeams shone on a gilded scroll .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 5]: Dalroy knew his Bible .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 30]: `` And a superscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew : ` This is the King of the Jews . '
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 27]: And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on Him , saying , ` If Thou be Christ , save Thyself and us . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 29]: From that instant one God-fearing Briton , at least , never again allowed the shadow of a doubt to darken his faith in the divine if inscrutable purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 38]: He had passed already through dark and deadly hours , while others were then near at hand ; but he was steadfast in doing what he conceived his duty without seeking to interpret the ways of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 7]: `` If Thou be Christ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 46]: It was the last taunt of the unbeliever , though the veil of the temple would be rent in twain , and the earth would quake , and the graves be opened , and the bodies of the saints arise and be seen by many !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 7]: A harsh command silenced the singing .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 25]: An officer had reined in his horse , and was demanding the nature of the errand which brought a squad of men from Visé .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 18]: `` Sergeant Karl Schwartz , _ Herr Hauptmann _ , '' reported the leader of the party .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 23]: `` An Englishman , assisted by a miller named Joos and his man , Maertz , has killed three of our officers .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 23]: He also wounded Herr Leutnant von Huntzel , of the 7th Westphalian regiment , who has recovered sufficiently to say what happened .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 8]: The general-major has ordered a strict search .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 23]: I , being acquainted with the district , am bringing these men to a wood where the rascals may be hiding . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 7]: `` Killed three , you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 12]: The fiend take all such _ schwein-hunds _ and their helpers !
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 5]: Good luck to you .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 4]: -- _ Vorwärts !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 7]: _ '' The column moved on .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 15]: Schwartz , the treacherous barber of Visé , led his men into the lane .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 30]: There were eleven , all told -- hopeless odds -- because this gang of hunters was ready for a fight and itching to capture a _ verdammt Engländer _ .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 65]: And Joos 's `` safe retreat '' had been guessed by the spy who knew what every inhabitant of Visé did , who had watched and noted even such a harmless occupation as Léontine 's bilberry-picking , who was acquainted with each footpath for miles around , from whose crafty eyes not a cow-byre on any remote farm in the whole countryside was concealed .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 9]: This misfortune marked the end , Dalroy thought .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 46]: But there was a chance of escape , if only for the few remaining hours of the night , and he took it with the same high courage he displayed in going back to the rescue of Irene Beresford in the railway station at Aix .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 16]: He had a rifle with five rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 28]: At the worst , he might be able to add another couple of casualties to the formidable total already piled up during the German advance on Liège .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 35]: The sabots offered a serious handicap to rapid and silent movement , but he dared not dispense with them , and made shift to follow Schwartz and the others as quietly as might be .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 63]: He was helped , of course , by the din of the guns and the rustling of the leaves ; but there was an open space in the narrow road before it merged in the wood which he could not cross until the Germans were among the trees , and precisely in that locality Schwartz halted his men to explain his project .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 21]: Try as he might , Dalroy , crouched behind a pollard oak , could not overhear the spy 's words .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 29]: But he smiled when the party went on in Indian file , Schwartz leading , because the enemy was acting just as he hoped the enemy would act .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 27]: He did not press close on their heels now , but remained deliberately at the foot of the hill and on the edge of the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 13]: Standing erect , with the rifle at the ready , he waited .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 16]: He could hear nothing , but judged time and distance by counting fifty slow steps .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 10]: He was right to a fifth of a second .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 15]: A shot rang out , and was followed instantly by a yell of agony .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 18]: He saw the flash , and , taking aim somewhat below it , fired six rounds rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 25]: A fusillade broke out in the wood , the Germans , like himself , firing at the one flash above and the six beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 48]: A bullet cut through his blouse on the left shoulder and scorched his skin ; but when the magazine was empty he ran straight on for a few yards , turned to the right , stepping with great caution , and threw himself flat behind a rock .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 22]: As he ran , he had refilled the magazine , but now meant using the rifle as a last resource only .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 12]: In effect , matters had fallen out exactly as he calculated .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 19]: Schwartz had blundered into the man-trap set on the path half-way up the cliff , and was shot .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 39]: The others , lacking a leader , and stupefied by the firing and the darkness , bolted like so many rabbits to the open road and the moonlight as soon as the seeming attack from the rear ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 32]: Uncommon grit was needed to press on through a strange wood at night , up a difficult path bordering a precipice when each tree might vomit the flame of a gunshot .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 10]: And these fellows were not cast in heroic mould .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 12]: Their one thought was to get back the way they came .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 7]: They were received warmly , too .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 41]: The passing regiment , hearing the hubbub and seeing the flashes , very reasonably supposed they were being taken in flank by a Belgian force , and blazed away merrily at the first moving objects in sight in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 21]: Dalroy does not know to this day exactly how the battle ended in rear , nor did he care then .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 15]: He had routed the enemy in his own neighbourhood , and that must suffice .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 22]: Regaining the path , he sped upward , pausing only to retrieve the pistol which had proved so efficient a sentinel .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 39]: Judging by the groans and the stertorous breathing which came from among the undergrowth close to the path , Karl Schwartz 's services as a spy and guide were lost to the great cause of _ Kultur _ .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 8]: Dalroy did not bother about the wretch .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 12]: He pressed on , and reached the plateau above the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 18]: The clearing was now flooded with moonlight , and the doorway of the hut was plainly visible .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 34]: Jan Maertz was not at his post , but this was not surprising , as he would surely have joined old Joos and the terrified women at the first sounds of the firing .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 4]: `` Liège ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 15]: said Dalroy , speaking loudly enough for any one in the hut to hear .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 4]: `` Liège ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 28]: he cried again , with a certain foreboding that things had gone awry , and dreading lest the precious respite he had secured might be wasted irretrievably .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 26]: But the hut was empty , and he realised that he might grope like a blind man for hours in the depths of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 17]: The one-sided battle which had broken out in the front of the calvary had died down .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 29]: He guessed what had happened , the blunder , the frenzied explanations , and their sequel in a quick decision to detach a company and surround the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 39]: In his exasperation he forgot the silent figure surveying the scene at the cross-roads , and swore like a very natural man , for he was now utterly at a loss what to do or where to go .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 27]: CHAPTER VIII A RESPITE Never before in the course of a somewhat varied life had Dalroy felt so irresolute , so helplessly the victim of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 24]: Bereft of the local knowledge possessed by Joos and the other Belgians , any scheme he adopted must depend wholly on blind chance .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 28]: The miller had described the wood as occupying a promontory in a bend of the Meuse , with steep cliffs forming the southern bank of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 25]: There was a tow-path ; possibly , a series of narrow ravines or clefts gave precarious access from the plateau to this lower level .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 29]: Probably , too , in the first shock of fright , the people in the hut had made for one of these cuttings , taking Irene with them .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 38]: They believed , no doubt , that the Englishman had been shot or captured , and after that spurt of musketry so alarmingly near at hand the lower part of the wood would seem alive with enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 13]: Dalroy blamed himself , not the others , for this fatal bungling .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 25]: Before snatching a much-needed rest he ought to have arranged with Joos a practicable line of retreat in the event of a night alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 39]: Of course he had imposed silence on all as a sort of compulsory relief from the tension of the earlier hours , but he saw now that he was only too ready to share the miller 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 22]: Not without reason had poor Dr. Lafarge warned his fellow-countrymen that `` there were far too many Germans in Belgium . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 38]: Schwartz and his like were to be found in every walk of life , from the merchant princes who controlled the trade of Antwerp to the youngest brush-haired waiter in the Café de la Régence at Brussels .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 13]: Dalroy was aware of a grim appropriateness in the fate of Schwartz .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 37]: The German automatic pistols carried soft-nosed bullets , so the arch-traitor who murdered the Visé doctor had himself suffered from one of the many infernal devices brought by _ Kultur _ to the battlefields of Flanders .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 15]: But the punishment of Schwartz could not undo the mischief the wretch had caused .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 13]: The men he led knew the nature and purpose of their errand .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 31]: They would report to the first officer met on the main road , who might be expected to detail instantly a sufficient force for the task of clearing the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 11]: In fact , the operation had become a military necessity .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 54]: There was no telling to what extent the locality was held by Belgian troops , as , of course , the runaway warriors would magnify the firing a hundredfold , and no soldier worth his salt would permit the uninterrupted march of an army corps along a road flanked by such a danger-point .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 28]: In effect , Dalroy conceived a hundred reasons why he might anticipate a sudden and violent end , but not one offering a fair prospect of escape .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 64]: At any rate , he refused to be guilty of the folly of plunging into an unknown jungle of brambles , rocks , and trees , and elected to go back by the path to the foot of the quarry , whence he might , with plenty of luck , break through on a flank before the Germans spread their net too wide .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 42]: He had actually crossed some part of the clearing in front of the hut when his gorge rose at the thought that , win or lose in this game of life and death , he might never again see Irene Beresford .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 5]: The notion was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 13]: He halted , and turned toward the black wall of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 34]: Mad though it was to risk revealing his whereabouts , since he had no means of knowing how close the nearest pursuers might be , he shouted loudly , `` Miss Beresford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 27]: And a sweet voice replied , `` Oh , Mr. Dalroy , they told me you were dead , but I refused to believe them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 18]: Dalroy had staked everything on that last despairing call , little dreaming that it would be answered .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: It was as though an angel had spoken from out of the black portals of death .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 34]: He was so taken aback , his spirit was so shaken , that for a few seconds he was tongue-tied , and Irene appeared in the moonlit space before he stirred an inch .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 16]: She came from an unexpected quarter , from the west , or Argenteau , side .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 66]: `` The others said I was a lunatic to return , '' she explained simply ; `` but , when I came to my full senses after being aroused from a sound sleep , and told to fly at once because the Germans were on us , I realised that you might have outwitted them again , and would be looking for us in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 7]: So , here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 5]: He ran to her .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 16]: Now that they were together again he was swift in decision and resolute as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 13]: `` Irene , '' he said , `` you 're a dear .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 5]: Where are our friends ?
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 5]: Is there a path ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 6]: Can you guide me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 9]: `` Take my hand , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 11]: `` We turn by a big tree in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 20]: I think Jan Maertz followed me a little way when he saw I was determined to go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 26]: `` I suppose I had unconscious faith in you , Irene , '' he whispered , `` and that is why I cried your name .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 6]: But no more talking now .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 10]: Rapid , silent movement alone can save us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 18]: They had not gone twenty yards beneath the trees when some one hissed , `` Visé ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 7]: `` Liège , you lump ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 3]: retorted Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 10]: `` Monsieur , I -- '' `` Shut up !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 10]: Hold mademoiselle 's hand , and lead on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 9]: He did not ask whither they were going .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 21]: The path led diagonally to the left , and that was what he wanted -- a way to a flank .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 12]: Maertz , however , soon faltered and stopped in his tracks .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 10]: `` The devil take all woods at night-time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 16]: `` Give me the highroad and a wagon-team , and I 'll face anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 6]: `` Are you lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 3]: asked Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 7]: `` I suppose so , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 7]: But they ca n't be far .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 13]: I told Joos -- '' `` Jan , is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 6]: cried Léontine 's voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 6]: _ Ah , Dieu merci !
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 11]: _ These infernal trees -- '' `` Silence now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 4]: growled Dalroy imperatively .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 9]: `` Go ahead as quickly as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 38]: The semblance of a path existed ; even so , they stumbled over gnarled roots , collided with tree-trunks which stood directly in the way , and had to fend many a low branch off their faces .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 31]: They created an appalling noise ; but were favoured by the fact that the footpath led to the west , whereas the pursuers must climb the cliff on the east .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 20]: Léontine , however , led them with the quiet certainty of a country-born girl moving in a familiar environment .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 52]: She could guess to a yard just where the track was diverted by some huge-limbed elm or far-spreading chestnut , and invariably picked up the right line again , for the excellent reason , no doubt , that the dense undergrowth stood breast high elsewhere at that season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 46]: After a walk that seemed much longer than it really was -- the radius of the wood from the hut being never more than two hundred yards in any direction -- the others heard her say anxiously , `` Are you there , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 12]: `` Where the deuce do you think I 'd be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 5]: came the irritated demand .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 21]: `` Do you imagine that your mother and I are skipping down these rocks like a couple of weasels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: `` It is quite safe , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 11]: `` I and Marie Lafarge went down only last Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 8]: Jules always goes that way to Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 9]: He has cut steps in the bad places .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 6]: Jan and I will lead .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 8]: We can help mother and you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 11]: Dalroy , still holding Irene 's arm , pressed forward .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 8]: `` Are we near the tow-path ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 13]: `` Oh , is that you , _ Monsieur l'Anglais _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 4]: chuckled the miller .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 21]: `` Name of a pipe , I was positive those _ sales Alboches _ had got you twenty minutes since .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 23]: Yes , if you trip in the next few yards you 'll find yourself on the tow-path after falling sixty feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 7]: `` Go on , Léontine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 3]: commanded Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 18]: `` What you and your friend did for amusement we can surely do to save our lives .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 9]: But there should be moonlight on this side .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 7]: Have any clouds come up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 9]: `` These are firs in front , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 10]: Once clear of them , we can see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: Do n't lose another second .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 18]: Only , before beginning the descent , make certain that the river bank holds no Germans . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 9]: Joos grumbled , but his wife silenced him .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 20]: That good lady , it appeared , had given up hope when the struggle broke out in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 22]: She had been snatched from the jaws of death by a seeming miracle , and regarded Dalroy as a very Paladin .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 26]: She attributed her rescue entirely to him , and was almost inclined to be sceptical of Joos 's sensational story about the killing of Busch .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 15]: `` There never was such a man for arguing , '' she said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 10]: `` I do believe you 'd contradict an archbishop .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 7]: Do as the gentleman bids you .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 5]: He knows best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 39]: Now , seeing that madame herself , after one look , had refused point-blank to tackle the supposed path , and had even insisted on retreating to the cover of the wood , Joos was entitled to protest .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 34]: Being a choleric little man , he would assuredly have done so fully and freely had not a red light illumined the tree-tops , while the crackle of a fire was distinctly audible .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 29]: The Germans had reached the top of the quarry , and , in order to dissipate the impenetrable gloom , had converted the hut into a beacon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 3]: _ Miséricorde !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 5]: _ '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 15]: `` They are burning our provisions , and may set the forest ablaze ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 7]: And that is what actually happened .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 15]: The vegetation was dry , as no rain had fallen for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 30]: The shavings and store of logs in the hut burned like tinder , promptly creating a raging furnace wholly beyond the control of the unthinking dolts who started it .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 25]: The breeze which had sprung up earlier became a roaring tornado among the trees , and some acres of woodland were soon in flames .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 15]: The light of that fire was seen over an area of hundreds of miles .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 56]: Spectators in Holland wrongly attributed it to the burning of Visé , which was , however , only an intelligent anticipation of events , because the delightful old town was completely destroyed a week later in revenge for the defeats inflicted on the invaders at Tirlemont and St. Trond during the first advance on Antwerp .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 18]: Once embarked on a somewhat perilous descent , the fugitives gave eyes or thought to naught else .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 36]: Jules , the pioneer quoted by Léontine , who was the owner of the hut and maker of sabots , had rough-hewed a sort of stairway out of a narrow cleft in the rock face .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 29]: To young people , steady in nerve and sure of foot , the passage was dangerous enough , but to Joos and his wife it offered real hazard .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 10]: However , they were allowed no time for hesitancy .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 47]: With Léontine in front , guiding her father , and Maertz next , telling Madame Joos where to put her feet , while Dalroy grasped her broad shoulders and gave an occasional eye to Irene , they all reached the level tow-path without the least accident .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 20]: Irene , by the way , carried the rifle , so that Dalroy should have both hands at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 22]: Without a moment 's delay he took the weapon and readjusted the magazine , which he had removed for the climb .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 40]: Bidding the others follow at such a distance that they would not lose sight of him , yet be able to retire if he found the way disputed by soldiers , he set off in the direction of Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 28]: In his opinion the next ten minutes would decide whether or not they had even a remote chance of winning through to a place of comparative safety .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 16]: He had made up his own mind what to do if he met any Germans .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 43]: He would advise the Joos family and Maertz to hide in the cleft they had just descended , while he would take to the Meuse with Irene -- provided , that is , she agreed to dare the long swim by night .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 12]: Happily there was no need to adopt this counsel of despair .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 18]: The fire , instead of assisting the flanking party on the western side , only delayed them .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 36]: Sheer curiosity as to what was happening in the wood drew all eyes there rather than to the river bank , so the three men and three women passed along the tow-path unseen and unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 26]: After a half-mile of rapid progress Dalroy judged that they were safe for the time , and allowed Madame Joos to take a much-needed rest .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 25]: Though breathless and nearly spent , she , like the others , found an irresistible fascination in the scene lighted by the burning trees .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 40]: The whole countryside was resplendent in crimson and silver , because the landscape was now steeped in moonshine , and the deep glow of the fire was most perceptible in the patches where ordinarily there would be black shadows .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 25]: The Meuse resembled a river of blood , the movement of its sluggish current suggesting the onward roll of some fluid denser than water .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 15]: Old Joos , whose tongue was seldom at rest , used that very simile .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 15]: `` Those cursed Prussians have made Belgium a shambles , '' he added bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 6]: `` Look at our river .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 9]: It is n't our dear , muddy Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 10]: It 's a stream in the infernal regions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' gasped his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: `` And listen to those guns , Henri !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 15]: They beat a sort of _ roulade _ , like drums in hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 10]: This stout Walloon matron had never heard of Milton .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 11]: Her ears were not tuned to the music of Parnassus .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 35]: She would have gazed in mild wonder at one who told of `` noises loud and ruinous , '' When Bellona storms With all her battering engines , bent to raze Some capital city .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 26]: But in her distress of body and soul she had coined a phrase which two , at least , of her hearers would never forget .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 19]: The siege of Liège did , indeed , roar and rumble with the din of a demoniac orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 7]: Its clamour mounted to the firmament .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 38]: It was as though the nether fiends , following Moloch 's advice , were striving , Arm 'd with Hell flames and fury , all at once , O'er Heaven 's high towers to force resistless way .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: Dalroy himself yielded to the spell of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 11]: Here was red war such as the soldier dreams of .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 7]: His warrior spirit did not quail .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 44]: He longed only for the hour , if ever the privilege was vouchsafed , when he would stand shoulder to shoulder with the men of his own race , and watch with unflinching eye those same dread tokens of a far-flung battle line .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 9]: Irene Beresford seemed to read his passing mood .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 13]: `` War has some elements of greatness , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 16]: `` The pity is that while it ennobles a few it degrades the multitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 24]: With a woman 's intuition , she had gone straight to the heart of the problem propounded by Teutonism to an amazed world .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 17]: The `` degradation '' of a whole people was already Germany 's greatest and unforgivable offence .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 39]: Few , even the most cynical , among the students of European politics could have believed that the Kaiser 's troops would sully their country 's repute by the inhuman excesses committed during those first days in Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 44]: At the best , `` war is hell '' ; but the great American leader who summed up its attributes in that pithy phrase thought only of the mangled men , the ruined homesteads , the bereaved families which mark its devastating trail .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 10]: He had seen nothing of German `` frightfulness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 51]: The men he led would have scorned to ravage peaceful villages , impale babies on bayonets and lances , set fire to houses containing old and bedridden people , murder hostages , rape every woman in a community , torture wounded enemies , and shoot harmless citizens in drunken sport .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 17]: Yet the German armies did all these things before they were a fortnight in the field .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 21]: They are not impeached on isolated counts , attributable , perhaps , to the criminal instincts of a small minority .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 15]: They carried out bestial orgies in battalions and brigades acting under word of command .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 77]: The jolly , good-humoured fellows who used to tramp in droves through the Swiss passes every summer , each man with a rucksack on his back , and beguiling the road in lusty song , seemed to cast aside all their cheerful camaraderie , all their exuberant kindliness of nature , when garbed in the `` field gray '' livery of the State , and let loose among the pleasant vales and well-tilled fields of Flanders .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 9]: That will ever remain Germany 's gravest sin .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 64]: When `` the thunder of the captains and the shouting '' is stilled , when time has healed the wounds of victor and vanquished , the memories of Visé , of Louvain , of Aershot , of nearly every town and hamlet in Belgium and Northern France once occupied by the savages from beyond the Rhine , will remain imperishable in their horror .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: German _ Kultur _ was a highly polished veneer .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 39]: Exposed to the hot blast of war it peeled and shrivelled , leaving bare a diseased , worm-eaten structure , in which the honest fibre of humanity had been rotted by vile influences , both social and political .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 42]: Women seldom err when they sum up the characteristics of the men of a race , and the women of every other civilised nation were united in their dislike of German men long before the first week in August , 1914 .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 40]: Irene Beresford had yet to peer into the foulest depths of Teutonic `` degradation '' ; but she had sensed it as a latent menace , and found in its stark records only the fulfilment of her vague fears .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 12]: Dalroy read into her words much that she had left unsaid .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 31]: `` At best it 's a terrible necessity , '' he replied ; `` at worst it 's what we have seen and heard of during the past twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 26]: I shall never understand why a people which prided itself on being above all else intellectual should imagine that atrocity is a means toward conquest .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 16]: Such a theory is so untrue historically that Germany might have learnt its folly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 13]: Joos grew uneasy when his English friends spoke in their own language .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 15]: The suspicious temperament of the peasant is always doubtful of things outside its comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 15]: He would have been astounded if told they were discussing the ethics of warfare .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 14]: `` Well , have you two settled where we 're to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: he demanded gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 18]: `` In my opinion , the Meuse is the best place for the lot of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 25]: `` In with you , then , '' agreed Dalroy , `` but hand over your money to madame before you take the dip .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 14]: Léontine and Jan may need it later to start the mill running . ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 3]: Maertz laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 5]: The joke appealed strongly .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 7]: Madame Joos turned on her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 9]: `` How you do chatter , Henri ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 16]: `` We all owe our lives to this gentleman , yet you are n't satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 4]: The Meuse indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 8]: What will you be saying next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 7]: `` How far is Argenteau ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 4]: put in Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 19]: `` That 's it , where the house is on fire , '' said the miller , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 10]: `` About a kilomètre , I take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 6]: `` Something like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 7]: `` Have you friends there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 11]: `` Ay , scores , if they 're alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 9]: `` I hear no shooting in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 9]: Moreover , an army corps is passing through .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 5]: Let us go there .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 5]: Something may turn up .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 12]: We shall be safer among thousands of Germans than here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 4]: They walked on .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 12]: The Englishman 's air of decision was a tonic in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 24]: The fire on the promontory was now at its height , but a curve in the river hid the fugitives from possible observation .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 43]: Dalroy was confident as to two favourable factors -- the men of the marching column would not search far along the way they had come , and their commander would recall them when the wood yielded no trace of its supposed occupants .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 16]: There had been fighting along the right bank of the Meuse during the previous day .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 20]: German helmets , red and yellow Belgian caps , portions of accoutrements and broken weapons , littered the tow-path .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 7]: But no bodies were in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 21]: The river had claimed the dead and the wounded Belgians ; the enemy 's wounded had been transferred to Aix-la-Chapelle .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 8]: Nearing Argenteau they heard a feeble cry .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: They stopped , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 11]: Again it came , clearly this time : `` Elsa !
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 3]: Elsa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 17]: It was a man 's voice , and the name was that of a German woman .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 15]: Maertz searched in a thicket , and found a young German officer lying there .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 14]: He was delirious , calling for the help of one powerless to aid .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 13]: He seemed to become aware of the presence of some human being .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 13]: Perhaps his atrophied senses retained enough vitality to hear the passing footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 4]: `` Elsa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 15]: he moaned again , `` give me water , for God 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 14]: `` He 's done for , '' reported Maertz to the waiting group .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 8]: `` He 's covered with blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 15]: `` For all that he may prove our salvation , '' said Dalroy quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 5]: `` Sharp , now !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 9]: Pitch our firearms and ammunition into the river .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 17]: We must lift a gate off its hinges , and carry that fellow into Argenteau . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 3]: Joos grinned .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 8]: He saw the astuteness of the scheme .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 20]: A number of Belgian peasants bringing a wounded officer to the ambulance would probably be allowed to proceed scot-free .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 23]: But he was loath to part with the precious fork on which the blood of `` that fat Busch '' was congealing .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 29]: He thrust it into a ditch , and if ever he was able to retrieve it no more valued souvenir of the great war will adorn his dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 38]: They possessed neither wine nor water ; but a tiny rivulet flowing into the Meuse under a neighbouring bridge supplied the latter , and the wounded man gulped down great mouthfuls out of a _ Pickel-haube _ .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: It partially cleared his wits .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 6]: `` Where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 4]: he asked faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 18]: Dalroy nodded to Joos , who answered , `` On the Meuse bank , near Argenteau . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 6]: `` Ah , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 17]: Those cursed -- '' Some dim perception of his surroundings choked the word on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 18]: `` I was hit , '' he went on , `` and crawled among the bushes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 9]: `` Was there fighting here this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 9]: To-day is Tuesday , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 8]: `` No , Wednesday midnight . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 5]: _ Ach , Gott !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 9]: _ That _ verdammt _ ambulance missed me !
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 8]: I have lain here two days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 15]: This time he swore without hesitation , since he was cursing his own men .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 6]: Jan came with a hurdle .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: `` This is lighter than a gate , monsieur , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 12]: Dalroy nudged Joos sharply , and the miller took the cue .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 7]: `` Right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 11]: `` Now , you two , handle him carefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: The German groaned piteously , and fainted .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 8]: `` Oh , he 's dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: gasped Irene , when she saw his head drop .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 7]: `` No , he will recover .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 6]: But do n't speak English .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 20]: -- As for you , Jan Maertz , no more of your ` monsieur ' and ` madame . '
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 10]: I am Pierre , and this lady is Clementine .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 4]: You understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 4]: Dalroy spoke emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 12]: Had the German retained his wits their project might be undone .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 23]: In the event , the pain of movement on the hurdle revived the wounded man , and he asked for more water .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 14]: They were then entering the outskirts of Argenteau , so they kept on .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 20]: Soon they gained the main road , and Joos inquired of an officer the whereabouts of a field hospital .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 16]: He directed them quite civilly , and offered to detail men to act as bearers .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 11]: But the miller was now his own shrewd self again .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 26]: `` No , '' he said bluntly , `` I and my family have rescued your officer , and we want a safe conduct . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 8]: Off they went with their living passport .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 21]: The field hospital was established in the village school , and here the patient was turned over to a surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 14]: As it happened , the latter recognised a friend , and was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 76]: He sent an orderly with them to find the major in charge of the lines of communication , and they had not been in Argenteau five minutes before they were supplied with a _ laisser passer _ , in which they figured as Wilhelm Schultz , farmer , and wife , Clementine and Léontine , daughters , and the said daughters ' fiancés , Pierre Dampier and Georges Lambert ; residence Aubel ; destination Andenne .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 10]: There was not the least hitch in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 10]: The major was , in his way , courteous .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 16]: Joos gave his own Christian name as `` Guillaume , '' but the German laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 28]: `` You 're a good citizen of the Fatherland now , my friend , '' he guffawed , `` so we 'll make it ` Wilhelm . '
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 23]: As for this pair of doves , '' and he eyed the two girls , `` warn off any of our lads .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 12]: Tell them that I , Major von Arnheim , said so .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 13]: They 're a warm lot where a pretty woman is concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 15]: Von Arnheim was a stout man , a not uncommon quality in German majors .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 14]: Perhaps he wondered why Joos looked fixedly at the pit of his stomach .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 22]: But a motor cyclist dashed up with a despatch , and he forgot all about `` Schultz '' and his family .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 39]: As it happened , he was a man of some ability , and the hopeless block at Aix caused by the stubborn defence of Liège had brought about the summary dismissal of a General by the wrathful Kaiser .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 13]: Hence , the Argenteau major was promoted and recalled to the base .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 64]: His next in rank , summoned to the post an hour later , knew nothing of the _ laisser passer _ granted to a party which closely resembled the much-wanted miller of Visé and his companions ; he read an `` urgent general order '' for their arrest without the least suspicion that they had slipped through the net in that very place .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 11]: Meanwhile these things were in the lap of the gods .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 16]: For the moment , the six people were free , and actually under German protection .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 22]: CHAPTER IX AN EXPOSITION OF GERMAN METHODS Three large and powerful automobiles stood at rest in the tiny square of Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 32]: Nearly every little town in Belgium and France possesses its _ place _ , the hub of social and business life , the centre where roads converge and markets are held .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: In the roadway , near the cars , were several officers , deep in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 26]: `` Look , '' murmured Irene to Dalroy , `` the high-shouldered , broadly-built man , facing this way , is General von Emmich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 14]: By this time Dalroy was acquainted with the name of the German commander-in-chief .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 30]: He found a fleeting interest in watching him now , while Joos and the others loitered irresolutely on the pavement outside the improvised office of the _ Kommandantur _ .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 37]: Though the moon was high and clear , there was no other light , and the diffused brilliance of the `` orbèd maiden , with white fire laden , '' is not favourable to close observation .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 10]: But Von Emmich 's bearing and gestures were significant .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 43]: He put an abrupt end to the conclave by an emphatic sweep of his right arm , and the larger number of his staff disposed themselves in two of the cars , in which the chauffeurs and armed escorts were already seated .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 9]: They made off in the direction of Aix .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 8]: It was easy to guess their errand .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 6]: More cannon , more cannon-fodder !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 17]: The generalissimo himself remained apart from the colonel and captain who apparently formed his personal suite .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 11]: He strode to and fro , evidently in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 31]: Once he halted quite close to the little company of peasants , and Dalroy believed he saw tears in his eyes , tears instantly brushed away by an angry hand .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 15]: Whatever the cause of this emotion , the General quickly mastered a momentary weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 52]: Indeed , that spasmodic yielding seemed to have braced his will to a fixed purpose , because he walked to the waiting car , wrote something by the light of an electric torch , and said to the younger of the staff officers , `` Take that to the field telegraph .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 6]: It must have priority . ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 11]: Somehow , Dalroy sensed the actual text of the message .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 39]: Von Emmich was making the humiliating admission that Liège , far from having fallen , as he had announced during the first hours of the advance , was still an immovable barrier against a living torrent of men .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 51]: So the heart of this middle-aged warrior , whose repute was good when measured by the Prussian standard , had not melted because of the misery and desolation he and his armed ruffians had brought into one of the most peaceful , industrious , and law-abiding communities in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 11]: His tears flowed because of failure , not of regret .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: His withers were wrung by mortification , not pity .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 34]: He would have waded knee-deep in the blood of Belgium if only he could have gained his ends and substantiated by literal fact that first vainglorious telegram to the War Lord of Potsdam .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 29]: Now he had to ask for time , reinforcements , siege guns , while the clock ticked inexorably , and England , France , and Russia were mobilising .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 31]: Perhaps it was in that hour that his morbid thoughts first turned to a suicide 's death as the only reparation for what he conceived to be a personal blunder .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 11]: Yet his generalship was marked by no grave strategical fault .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 29]: If aught erred , it was the German State machine , which counted only on mankind having a body and a brain , but denied it a soul .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 20]: Von Emmich 's troubles were no concern of Dalroy 's , save in their reaction on his own difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 39]: He was conscious of a certain surprise that Irene Beresford should recognise one of the leaders of modern Germany so promptly ; but this feeling , in its turn , yielded to the vital things of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 18]: `` Let us be moving , '' he said quietly , and led the way with Joos .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 11]: `` Why did you give Andenne as your destination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 10]: `` My wife 's cousin lives there , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: She is married to a man named Alphonse Stauwaert .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 8]: I _ had _ to say something .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 11]: I remembered Madame Stauwaert in the nick of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 7]: `` But Andenne lies beyond Liège .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 26]: To get there we shall have to traverse the whole German line , and pass some of the outlying forts , which is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: `` We must go somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: But why not make for a place that is attainable ?
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 19]: Heaven -- or Purgatory , at any rate -- is far more easily reached to-night than Andenne . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 17]: `` I did n't say we were going there at once , '' snapped the miller .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 28]: `` It 's more than twenty-five kilomètres from here , and is far enough away to be safe when I 'm asked where I am bound for .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 13]: My wife could n't walk it to-morrow , let alone to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 16]: `` Andenne lies down the valley of the Meuse too , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 4]: `` Ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 15]: `` Well , is n't that simply falling off a rock into a whirlpool ?
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 22]: The Germans must pass that way to France , and it is France they are aiming at , not Belgium . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 12]: `` They talk mostly about England , '' said Joos sapiently .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: `` Yes , because they fear her .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 9]: But let us avoid politics , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 15]: Our present problem is how and where to bestow these women for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 13]: After that , the sooner we three men leave them the better .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 8]: I , at least , must go .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 17]: I may be detected any minute , and then -- God help you others ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 3]: _ Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 12]: _ That is n't the way you English are treating us .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 11]: No , monsieur , we sink or swim together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 11]: That ready disavowal of any clash of interests was cheering .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 15]: The little man 's heart was sound , though his temper might be short .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 27]: Good faith , however , was not such a prime essential now as good judgment , and Dalroy halted again at a corner of the square .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 7]: To stay in Argenteau was madness .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 7]: But -- there were three roads .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 16]: One led to Visé , one to Liège , and one to the German frontier !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 7]: The first two were closed hopelessly .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 19]: The third , open in a sense , was fantastic when regarded as a possible avenue of escape .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 14]: Yet that third road offered the only path toward comparative security and rest .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 38]: `` I wish you would n't look so dejected , '' whispered Irene , peeping up into Dalroy 's downcast face with the winsome smile which had so taken his fancy during the long journey from Berlin .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 10]: `` I 've been counting our gains and losses .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: Surely the balance is heavy on our side .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 14]: We -- you , that is -- have defeated the whole German army .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 29]: We 've lost some sleep and some clothes , but have secured a safe-conduct from our enemies , after knocking a good many of them on the head .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 23]: Some men , I know , look miserable when most successful ; but I do n't put you in that category . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 31]: She was careful to talk German , not that there was much chance of being actually overheard , but to prevent the sibilant accents of English speech reaching suspicious ears .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 21]: Britons who have no language but their own are often surprised when abroad at hearing children mimicking them by hissing .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 15]: Curiously enough , such is the effect of our island tongue on foreign ears .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 49]: Monosyllables like `` yes , '' `` this , '' `` it 's , '' and scores of others in constant use , no less than the almost invariable plural form of nouns , lead to the illusion , which Irene was aware of , and guarded against .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 25]: Yet , despite the uncouth , harsh-sounding words on her lips , and the coarse Flemish garments she wore , she was adorably English .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 18]: Léontine Joos was a pretty girl ; but , in true feminine parlance , `` lumpy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 19]: Some three inches less in height than her `` sister , '' she probably weighed a stone more .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 22]: Léontine trudged when she walked , Irene moved with a grace which not even a pair of clumsy sabots could hide .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 9]: Luckily they were alike in one important particular .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 37]: Their faces and hands were soiled , their hair untidy , and the passage through the wood had scratched foreheads and cheeks until the skin was broken , and little patches of congealed blood disfigured them .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 15]: `` I may look more dejected than I feel , '' Dalroy reassured her .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 9]: `` I 'm playing a part , remember .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 16]: I 've kept my head down and my knees bent until my joints ache . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 8]: `` Oh , is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 8]: she cooed , with a relieved air .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 20]: How could he know then that the sabots were chafing her ankles until the pain had become well-nigh unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 24]: If she could have gratified her own wishes she would have crept to the nearest hedge and flung herself down in utter weariness .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 20]: Joos , having pondered the Englishman 's views on Andenne as an unattainable refuge , scratched his head perplexedly .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 16]: `` I think we had better go toward Herve , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 14]: `` This is the road , '' and he pointed to the left .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 25]: `` On the way we can branch off to a farm I know of , if it happens to be clear of soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 7]: Any goal was preferable to none .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 34]: They entered the eastward-bound road , but had not advanced twenty yards along it before the way was blocked by a mass of commissariat wagons and scores of Uhlans standing by their horses .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 11]: Two officers , heedless who heard , were wrangling loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 17]: `` There is nothing else for it , _ Herr Hauptmann _ , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 11]: `` It does n't matter who is actually to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 12]: You have taken the wrong road , and must turn back .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 14]: Every yard farther in this direction puts you deeper in the mire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 16]: `` But I was misdirected as far away as Bleyberg , '' protested the other .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 15]: `` Some never-to-be-forgotten hound of hell told me that this was the Verviers road .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 5]: _ Gott in himmel !
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 12]: _ and I _ must _ be there by dawn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 7]: Dalroy was gazing at the wagons .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 5]: They seemed oddly familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 12]: The painted legend on the tarpaulins placed the matter beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 14]: These were the very vehicles he had seen in the station-yard at Aix-la-Chapelle !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 14]: At this crisis Jan Maertz 's sluggish brain evolved a really clever notion .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 32]: The Germans wanted a guide , and who so well qualified for the post as a carter to whom each turn and twist in every road in the province was familiar ?
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 9]: Without consulting any one , he pushed forward .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 16]: `` Pardon , _ Herr General _ , '' he said in his offhand way .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 24]: `` Give me and my friends a lift , and I 'll have you and your wagons in Verviers in three hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 34]: Brutality is so engrained in the Prussian that an offer which a man of another race would have accepted civilly was treated almost as an insult by the angry leader of the convoy .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 26]: `` You 'll guide me with the point of a lance close to your liver , you Belgian swine-dog , '' was the ungracious answer .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 5]: `` Not me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 3]: retorted Maertz .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 6]: `` Here , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 12]: he cried to Joos , `` show this gentleman your paper .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 16]: He ca n't go about sticking people as he likes , even in war-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 4]: Joos went forward .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 24]: Moved by contemptuous curiosity , the two officers examined the miller 's _ laisser passer _ by the light of an electric torch .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 12]: The commissariat officer changed his tone when he saw the signature .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 44]: The virtue of military obedience becomes a grovelling servitude in the German army , and a man who was ready to act with the utmost unfairness if left to his own instincts grew almost courteous at sight of the communications officer 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 11]: `` Your case is different , '' he admitted grudgingly .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 6]: `` Is this your party ?
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 10]: The old man is Herr Schultz , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 5]: Which are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 12]: `` I 'm Georges Lambert , _ Herr General _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 8]: `` And what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 8]: `` We 're all going to Andenne .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 6]: It 's on the paper .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 19]: This infernal fighting has smashed up our place at Aubel , and the women are footsore and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 4]: So is papa .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 6]: Put them in a wagon .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 8]: Dampier and I can leg it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 9]: The Prussian was becoming more civil each moment .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 29]: He realised , too , that this gruff fellow who moved about the country under such powerful protection was a veritable godsend to him and his tired men .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 21]: `` No , no , '' he cried , grown suddenly complaisant , `` we can do better than that .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 26]: I 'll dump a few trusses of hay , and put you all in the same wagon , which can then take the lead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 28]: Thus , by a mere turn of fortune 's wheel , the enemy was changed into a friend , and a dangerous road made safe and comfort-giving .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 25]: Jan sat in front with the driver , and cracked jokes with him , while the others nestled into a load of sweet-smelling hay .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 35]: `` For the first time in my life , '' whispered Dalroy to Irene , `` I understand the precise significance of Samson 's riddle about the honey extracted from the lion 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 8]: Our heavy-witted Jan has saved the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 15]: We enter Verviers in triumph , and reach the left of the German lines .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 23]: Just another slice of luck , and we cross the Meuse at Andenne or elsewhere -- it does n't matter where . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 8]: Irene had kicked off those cruel sabots .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 26]: She bit her lip in the darkness to stifle a sob before answering coolly , `` Shall we be clear of the Germans then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 6]: `` I -- hope so .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 14]: Their armies dare not advance so long as we hear those guns . ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 11]: The girl could not reason in the soldier 's way .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 16]: She thought she would `` hear those guns '' during the rest of her life .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 14]: Never had she dreamed of anything so horrific as that drumming of cannon .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 19]: She believed , as women do , that every shell tore hundreds of human beings limb from limb .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 36]: In silent revolt against the frenzy which seemed to possess the world , she closed her eyes and buried her head in the hay ; and once again exhausted nature was its own best healer .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 30]: When the convoy rumbled into Verviers in the early morning , having followed a by-road through Julemont and Herve , Irene had to be awaked out of deep sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 8]: Yet the boom of the guns continued !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 35]: Liège was still holding out , a paranoiac despot was frantic with wrath , and civilised Europe had yet another day to prepare for the caging of the beast which threatened its very existence .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 29]: The leader of the convoy was greeted by a furious staff officer in such terms that Dalroy judged it expedient he and the others should slip away quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 6]: This they contrived to do .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 19]: Maertz recommended an inn in a side street , where they would be welcomed if accommodation were available .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 4]: And it was .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: There were no troops billeted in Verviers .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 10]: Every available man was being hurried to the front .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 14]: Dalroy watched two infantry regiments passing while Maertz and Joos were securing rooms .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 39]: Though the soldiers were sturdy fellows , and they could not have made an excessively long march , many of them limped badly , and only maintained their places in the ranks by force of an iron discipline .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 10]: He was puzzled to account for their jaded aspect .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 33]: An hour later , while lying awake in a fairly comfortable bed , and trying to frame some definite programme for the day which had already dawned , he solved the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 7]: The soldiers were wearing new boots !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 10]: Germany had _ everything _ ready for her millions .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 27]: He learnt subsequently that when the German armies entered the field they were followed by ammunition trains carrying four thousand million rounds of small-arm cartridges alone !
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 39]: He met Joos and Maertz at _ déjeuner _ , a rough but satisfying meal , and was faced by the disquieting fact that neither Madame Joos nor Irene could leave the bedroom which they shared with Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 27]: Madame was done up ; _ cette course l' a excédé _ , her husband put it ; while mademoiselle 's ankles were swollen and painful .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 11]: These misfortunes were , perhaps , a blessing in disguise .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 27]: An enforced rest was better than no rest at all , and the constant vigil by night and day was telling even on the apple-cheeked Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 17]: Joos wanted to wander about the town and pick up news , but Dalroy dissuaded him .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 27]: The woman who kept the little _ auberge _ was thoroughly trustworthy , and hardly another soul in Verviers knew of their presence in the town .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 12]: News they could do without , whereas recognition might be fatal .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 10]: Irene put in an appearance late in the day .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 22]: She had borrowed a pair of slippers , and the landlady had promised to buy her a pair of strong boots .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 10]: Sabots she would never wear again , she vowed .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 29]: They might be comfortable and watertight when one was accustomed to them , but life was too strenuous in Belgium just then to permit of experiments in footgear .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 10]: When night fell Joos could not be kept in .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 40]: It was understood that the _ Kommandantur _ had ordered all inhabitants to remain indoors after nine o'clock , so the old man had hardly an hour at his disposal for what he called a _ petit tour _ .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 7]: But he was not long absent .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 29]: He had encountered a friend , a curé whose church near Aubel had been blown to atoms by German artillery during a frontier fight on the Monday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 17]: This gentleman , a venerable ecclesiastic , discovered Dalroy 's nationality after five minutes ' chat .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 15]: He had in his possession a copy of a proclamation issued by Von Emmich .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 22]: It began : `` I regret very much to find that German troops are compelled to cross the frontier of Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 42]: They are constrained to do so by sheer necessity , the neutrality of Belgium having already been violated by French officers , who , in disguise , have passed through Belgian territory in an automobile in order to penetrate Germany . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 28]: The curé , whose name was Garnier , laughed sarcastically at the childishness of the pretext put forward by the commander-in-chief of the Army of the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 19]: `` Was war waged for such a flimsy reason ever before in the history of the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: `` What fire-eaters these ` disguised ' French officers must have been !
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 17]: Imagine the hardihood of the braves who would ` penetrate ' mighty Germany in one automobile !
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 30]: This silly lie bears the date of 4th August , yet my beloved church was then in ruins , and a large part of the village in flames ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 8]: `` Verviers seems to have escaped punishment .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 8]: How do you account for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 3]: inquired Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 22]: `` It seems to be a deliberate policy on the part of the Germans to spare one town and destroy another .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 34]: Both serve as examples , the one as typical of the excellent treatment meted out to those communities which welcome the invaders , the other as a warning of the fate attending resistance .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 6]: Both instances are absolutely untrue .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 34]: Every burgomaster in Belgium has issued notices calling on non-combatants to avoid hostile acts , and Verviers is exactly on a par with the other unfortified towns in this part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 23]: The truth is , monsieur , that the Germans are furious because of the delay our gallant soldiers have imposed on them .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 6]: It is bearing fruit too .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 13]: I hear that England has already landed an army at Ostend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 5]: Dalroy shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 13]: `` I wish I might credit that , '' he said sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 26]: `` I am a soldier , monsieur , and you may take it from me that such a feat is quite impossible in the time .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 26]: We might send twenty or thirty thousand men by the end of this week , and another similar contingent by the end of next week .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 32]: But months must elapse before we can put in the field an army big enough to make headway against the swarms of Germans I have seen with my own eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: `` Months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 4]: gasped the curé .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 10]: `` Then what will become of my unhappy country ?
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 8]: Even to-day we are living on hope .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 23]: Liège still holds out , and the people are saying , ` The English are coming , all will be well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 15]: A man was shot to-day in this very town for making that statement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 19]: `` He must have been a fool to voice his views in the presence of German troops . ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 10]: The priest spread wide his hands in sorrowful gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 10]: `` You do n't understand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 7]: `` Belgium is overrun with spies .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 13]: It is positively dangerous to utter an opinion in any mixed company .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 17]: One or two of the bystanders will certainly be in the pay of the enemy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 27]: Though the curé was now on surer ground than when he spoke of a British army on Belgian soil , Dalroy egged him on to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 22]: `` My chief difficulty is to know how the money was raised to support all these agencies , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 5]: `` Consider , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 6]: Germany maintains an enormous army .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 11]: She has a fleet second only to that of Britain .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 15]: She finances her traders and subsidises her merchant ships as no other nation does .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 26]: How is it credible that she should also find means to keep up a secret service which must have cost millions sterling a year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 18]: `` Yes , you are certainly English , '' said the priest , with a sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 14]: `` You do n't begin to estimate the peculiarities of the German character .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 27]: We Belgians , living , so to speak , within arm 's - length of Germany , have long seen the danger , and feared it .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 13]: Every German is taught that the world is his for the taking .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 24]: Every German is encouraged in the belief that the national virtue of organised effort is the one and only means of commanding success .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 11]: Thus , the State is everything , the individual nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: But the State rewards the individual for services rendered .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 27]: The German dotes on titles and decorations , and what easier way of earning both than to supply information deemed valuable by the various State departments ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 31]: Plenty of wealthy Germans in Belgium paid their own spies , and used the knowledge so gained for their private ends as well as for the benefit of the State .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 36]: During the past twenty years the whole German race has become a most efficient secret society , its members being banded together for their common good , and leagued against the rest of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 19]: The German never loses his nationality , no matter how long he may dwell in a foreign country .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 31]: My own church claims to be Catholic and universal , yet I would not trust a German colleague in any matter where the interests of his country were at stake .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 15]: The Germans are a race apart , and believe themselves superior to all others .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 22]: There was a time , in my youth , when Prussia was distinct from Saxony , or Würtemberg , or Bavaria .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 5]: That feeling is dead .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 57]: The present Emperor has welded his people into one tremendous machine , partly by playing upon their vanity , partly by banging the German drum during his travels , but mainly by dangling before their eyes the reward that men have always found irresistible -- the spoliation of other lands , the prospect of sudden enrichment .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 17]: Every soldier marching past this house at the present moment hopes to rob Belgium and France .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 18]: And now England is added to the enticing list of well-stocked properties that may be lawfully burgled .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 7]: I am no prophet , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 21]: I am only an old man who has watched the upspringing of a new and terrible force in European politics .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 40]: I may live an hour or ten years ; but if God spares me for the latter period I shall see Germany either laid in the dust by an enraged world or dominating the earth by brutal conquest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 23]: But for the outbreak of the war Dalroy would have passed the `` interpreter '' test in German some few weeks later .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 21]: He had spent his `` language leave '' in Berlin , and was necessarily familiar with German thought and literature .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 8]: Often had he smiled at Teutonic boastfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 33]: Now the simple words of an aged village curé had given a far-reaching and sinister meaning to much that had seemed the mere froth of a vigorous race fermenting in successful trade .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 16]: `` Do you believe that the German colony in England pursues the same methods ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 25]: he asked , and his heart sank as he recalled the wealth and social standing of the horde of Germans in the British Isles .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: `` Can the leopard change his spots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 4]: quoted the other .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 20]: `` A year ago one of my friends , a maker of automobiles , thought I needed a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: He took me to England .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 9]: God has been good to Britain , monsieur !
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 8]: He has given you riches and power .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 6]: But you are grown careless .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 16]: I stayed in five big hotels , two in London and three in the provinces .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 7]: They were all run by Germans .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 32]: I made inquiries , thinking I might benefit some of my village lads ; but the German managers would employ none save German waiters , German cooks , German reception clerks .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 6]: Your hall porters were Germans .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 21]: You never cared to reflect , I suppose , that hotels are the main arteries of a country 's life .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 8]: But the canker did not end there .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 12]: Your mills and collieries were installing German plant under German supervisors .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 9]: Your banks -- '' The speaker paused dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 11]: `` But our God is not a German God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 12]: he cried , and his sunken eyes seemed to shoot fire .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 24]: `` Last night , listening to the guns that were murdering Belgium , I asked myself , why does Heaven permit this crime ?
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 13]: And the answer came swiftly : German influences were poisoning the world .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 15]: They had to be eradicated , or mankind would sink into the bottomless pit .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: So God has sent this war .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: Be of good heart .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 17]: Remember the words of Saint Paul : ` So also is the resurrection of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 12]: It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 12]: It is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 14]: It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 11]: The curé 's voice had unconsciously attained the pulpit pitch .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 9]: The clear , incisive accents reached other ears .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 11]: The landlady crept in , with a face of scare .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 10]: she whispered , `` the doors are wide open .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 6]: It is an order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 7]: Dalroy went rapidly into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 5]: No loiterer was visible .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 21]: Not even a crowd of five persons might gather to watch the military pageant ; it was _ verboten _ .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 25]: And ever the dim shapes flitted by in the night -- horse , foot , and artillery , automobiles , ambulance and transport wagons .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 11]: There seemed no end to this flux of gray-green gnomes .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 17]: The air was tremulous with the unceasing hammer-strokes of heavy guns on the anvil of Liège .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 15]: Staid old Europe might be dissolving even then in a cloud of high-explosive gas .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 8]: The scheme of things was all awry .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 7]: One Englishman gave up the riddle .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 22]: He turned on his heel , and lit one of the cheap cigars purchased in Aix-la-Chapelle less than forty-eight hours ago !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 16]: CHAPTER X ANDENNE Madame Joos was old for her fifty years , and heavy withal .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 17]: Hers was not the finer quality of human clay which hardens in the fire of adversity .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 23]: She became ill , almost seriously ill , and had to be nursed back into good health again during nine long days .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 13]: And long these days were , the longest Dalroy had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 34]: To a man of his temperament , enforced inactivity was anathema in any conditions ; a gnawing doubt that he was not justified in remaining in Verviers at all did not improve matters .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 13]: Monsieur Garnier , the curé , was a frequent though unobtrusive visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 29]: He doctored the invalid , and brought scraps of accurate information which filtered through the far-flung screen of Uhlans and the dense lines of German infantry and guns .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 17]: Thus the fugitives knew when and where the British Expeditionary Force actually landed on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 39]: They heard of the gradual sapping of the defences of Liège , until Fort Loncin fell , and , with it , as events were to prove , the shield which had protected Belgium for nearly a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 54]: The respite did not avail King Albert and his heroic people in so far as the occupation and ravaging of their beautiful country was concerned ; but calm-eyed historians in years to come will appraise at its true value the breathing-space , slight though it was , thus secured for France and England .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 19]: Dalroy found it extraordinarily difficult to sift the true from the false in the crop of conflicting rumours .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 12]: In the first instance , German legends had to be discounted .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: From the outset of the campaign the Kaiser 's armies were steadily regaled with accounts of phenomenal successes _ elsewhere _ .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 49]: Thus , when four army corps , commanded now by Von Kluck , were nearly demoralised by the steadfast valour of General Leman and his stalwarts , the men were rallied by being told that the Crown Prince was smashing his way to Paris through Nancy and Verdun .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 20]: Prodigies were being performed in Poland and the North Sea , and London was burnt by Zeppelins almost daily .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 13]: Nor did Belgian imagination lag far behind in this contest of unveracity .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 58]: British and French troops were marching to the Meuse by a dozen roads ; the French raid into Alsace was magnified into a great military feat ; the British fleet had squelched the German navy by sinking nineteen battleships ; the Kaiser , haggard and blear-eyed , was alternately degrading and shooting Generals and issuing flamboyant proclamations .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 19]: Finally , Russia was flattening out East Prussia and Galicia with the slow crunching of a steam roller .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 21]: Out of this maelström of `` news '' a level-headed soldier might , and did , extract certain hard facts .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 25]: The landing of Sir John French 's force took place exactly at the time and place and in the numbers Dalroy himself had estimated .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 12]: To throw a small army into Flanders would have been folly .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 14]: Obviously , the British must join hands with the French before offering battle .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 36]: For the rest -- though he went out very little , and alone , as being less risky -- he recognised the hour when the German machine recovered its momentum after the first unexpected collapse .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 6]: He saw order replace chaos .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 20]: He watched the dragon crawling ever onward , and understood then that no act of man could save Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 17]: Verviers was the best possible site for an observer who knew how to use his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 24]: He assumed that what was occurring there was going on with equal precision in Luxembourg and along the line of the Vosges Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 14]: Gradually , too , he reconciled his conscience to these days of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 40]: He believed now that his services would be immensely more useful to the British commander-in-chief in the field if he could cross the French frontier rather than reach London and the War Office by way of the Belgian coast .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 6]: This decision lightened his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 16]: He was beginning to fear that the welfare of Irene Beresford was conflicting with duty .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 27]: It was cheering to feel convinced that the odds and ends of information picked up in Verviers might prove of inestimable value to the allied cause .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 41]: For instance , Liège was being laid low by eleven-inch howitzers , but he had seen seventeen-inch howitzers , each in three parts , each part drawn by forty horses or a dozen traction-engines , moving slowly toward the south-west .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 6]: There lay Namur and France .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 17]: No need to doubt now where the chief theatre of the war would find its habitat .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 17]: The German staff had blundered in its initial strategy , but the defect was being repaired .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 21]: All that had gone before was a mere prelude to the grim business which would be transacted beyond the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 25]: During that period of quiescence , certain minor and personal elements affecting the future passed from a nebulous stage to a state of quasi-acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 23]: There was not , there could not be , any pronounced love-making between two people so situated as Dalroy and Irene Beresford .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 32]: But eyes can exchange messages which the lips dare not utter , and these two began to realise that they were designed the one for the other by a wise Providence .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 32]: As that is precisely the right sentiment of young folk in love , romance throve finely in Madame Béranger 's little _ auberge _ in the Rue de Nivers at Verviers .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 32]: A tender glance , a touch of the hand , a lighting of a troubled face when the dear one appears -- these things are excellent substitutes for the spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 37]: Irene was `` Irene '' to Dalroy ever since that night in the wood at Argenteau , and the girl herself accepted the development with the deftness which is every woman 's legacy from Mother Eve .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 27]: `` If you make free with my Christian name I must retort by using yours , '' she said one day on coming down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 9]: `` So , ` Good-morning , Arthur . '
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 8]: Where did you get that hat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: The hat in question was a purchase , a wide-brimmed felt such as is common in Flanders .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 25]: Its Apache slouch , in conjunction with Jan Maertz 's oldest clothes and a week 's stubble of beard , made Dalroy quite villainous-looking .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 45]: Except in the details of height and physique , it would , indeed , be difficult for any stranger to associate this loose-limbed Belgian labourer with the well-groomed cavalry officer who entered the Friedrich Strasse Station in Berlin on the night of 3rd August .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 19]: That was as it should be , though the alteration was none the less displeasing to its victim .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 22]: Irene adopted a huge sun-bonnet , and compromised as to boots by wearing _ sabots en cuir _ , or clogs .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 17]: Singularly enough , white-haired Monsieur Garnier nearly brought matters to a climax as between these two .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 39]: On the Wednesday evening , when the last forts of Liège were crumbling , Madame Joos was reported convalescent and asleep , so both girls came to the little _ salon _ for a supper of stewed veal .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 23]: Naturally the war was discussed first ; but the priest was learning to agree with his English friend about its main features .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 22]: In sheer dismay at the black outlook before his country , he suddenly turned the talk into a more intimate channel .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 9]: `` What plans have you youngsters made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 13]: `` Monsieur Joos and I can only look back through the years .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: The places we know and love are abodes of ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 5]: The milestones are tombstones .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 10]: We can surely count more friends dead than living .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 6]: For you it is different .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 24]: The world will go on , war or no war ; but Verviers will not become your residence , I take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 39]: `` Jan and I mean to join our respective armies as soon as Monsieur Joos and the ladies are taken care of , and that means , I suppose , safely lodged in England , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 19]: `` If Léontine likes to marry me first , I 'm agreeable , '' put in Maertz promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 13]: It was a naïve confession , and every one laughed except Joos .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 27]: `` Léontine marries neither you nor any other hulking loafer while there is one German hoof left in Belgium , '' vowed the little man warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 4]: The priest smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 7]: He knew where the shoe pinched .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 19]: Maertz , if no loafer , was not what is vulgarly described as `` a good catch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 31]: `` I 've lost my parish , '' he said jestingly , `` and , being an inveterate match-maker , am on the _ qui vive _ for a job .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 16]: But if father says ` No ' we must wait till mother has a word .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 6]: Now for the other pair .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 6]: -- What of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 21]: Irene blushed scarlet , and dropped her serviette ; Dalroy , though flabbergasted , happily hit on a way out .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 10]: `` I 'm surprised at you , monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 13]: `` Look at mademoiselle , and then run your eye over me .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 10]: Did ever pretty maid wed such a scarecrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: `` I must refer that point to mademoiselle , '' retorted the priest .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: `` I do n't think either of you would choose a book by the cover . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 11]: At last I know the worst , '' laughed Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 19]: `` Who would believe that I once posed as the Discobulus in a _ tableau vivant _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 3]: demanded Joos .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 3]: Dalroy hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 11]: Neither his French nor German was equal to the translation .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 8]: `` A quoit-thrower , '' suggested Irene .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 4]: `` Quoits ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 4]: sniffed the miller .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 20]: `` I 'll take you on at that game any day you like for twenty francs every ringer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 6]: It was a safe offer .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 7]: Old Joos was a noted player .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 7]: He gave details of his prowess .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 20]: Dalroy , though modestly declining a contest , led him on , and steered the conversation clear of rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 18]: Thenceforth , for a whole day , Irene 's manner stiffened perceptibly , and Dalroy was miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 23]: Inexperienced in the ways of the sex , he little dreamed that Irene felt she had been literally thrown at his head .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 9]: But graver issues soon dispersed that small cloud .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 30]: On Saturday , 15th August , the thunder of the guns lessened and died down , being replaced by the far more distant and fitful barking of field batteries .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 12]: But the rumble on the cobbles of the main road continued .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 8]: What need to ask what had happened ?
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 8]: Around Liège lay the silence of death .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 11]: Late that afternoon a woman brought a note to Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 5]: It bore no address .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 25]: She merely handed it to him , and hurried off , with the furtive air of one afraid of being asked for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 14]: It ran : `` DEAR FRIEND , -- Save yourself and the others .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 5]: Lose not a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 6]: I have seen a handbill .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 6]: A big reward is offered .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 8]: My advice is : go west separately .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 16]: The messenger I employ is a Christian , but I doubt the faith of many .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 5]: May God guard you !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: I shall accompany you in my thoughts and prayers .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 9]: -- E. G. '' Dalroy found Joos instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 10]: `` What is our curé 's baptismal name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 6]: `` Edouard , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 8]: `` He has sent us marching orders .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 4]: Read that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 7]: The miller 's wizened face blanched .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 13]: He had counted on remaining in Verviers till the war was over .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 20]: At that date no self-respecting Belgian could bring himself to believe that the fighting would continue into the winter .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 28]: The first comparative successes of the small Belgian army , combined with the meteoric French advance into Alsace , seemed to assure speedy victory by the Allies .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 18]: He swore roundly , but decided to follow the priest 's bidding in every respect save one .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 11]: `` We ca n't split up , '' he declared .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 12]: `` We are all named in the _ laisser passer _ .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 9]: You understand what dull pigs these Germans are .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 5]: They 'll count heads .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 22]: If one is missing , or there 's one too many , they 'll inquire about it for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 17]: Sound common-sense and no small knowledge of Teuton character lurked in the old man 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 32]: Monsieur Garnier , of course , had not been told why this queerly assorted group clung together , nor was he aware of the exact cause of their flight from Visé .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 12]: Probably the handbill he mentioned was explicit in names and descriptions .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 21]: At any rate , he must have the strongest reasons for supposing that Verviers no longer provided a safe retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 5]: Jan Maertz was summoned .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 6]: He made a good suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 21]: The direct road to Andenne , viâ Liège and Huy , was impracticable , being crowded with troops and transports .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 16]: Why not use the country lanes from Pepinster through Louveigne , Hamoir , and Maffe ?
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 12]: It was a hilly country , and probably clear of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 16]: He would buy a dog-team , and thus save Madame Joos the fatigue of walking .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 5]: Dalroy agreed at once .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 36]: Even though Irene still insisted on sharing his effort to cross the German lines , two routes opened from Andenne , one to Brussels and the west , the other to Dinant and the south .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 50]: Moreover , he counted on the Allies occupying the Mons-Charleroi-Namur terrain , and one night 's march from Andenne , with Maertz as guide , should bring the three of them through , as the Joos family , in all likelihood , would elect to remain with their relatives .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 25]: In a word , the orderliness of Verviers had already relegated the excesses of Visé to the obscurity of an evil but half-forgotten dream .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 22]: The horrors of Louvain , of Malines , of the whole Belgian valley of the Meuse , had yet to come .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 21]: An officer of the British army simply could not allow his mind to conceive the purposeful criminality of German methods .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 30]: Little did he imagine that , on the very day the fugitives set out for Andenne , Visé was completely sacked and burned by command of the German authorities .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 22]: Not because of any fault committed by the unfortunate inhabitants , who had suffered so much at the outbreak of hostilities .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 11]: This second avalanche was let loose out of sheer spite .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 30]: By this time the enemy was commencing to estimate the fearful toll which the Belgian army had taken of the Uhlans who provided the famous `` cavalry screen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 18]: Over and over again the vaunted light horsemen of Germany were ambuscaded and cut up or captured .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 29]: They proved to be extraordinarily poor fighters when in small numbers , but naturally those who got away made a fine tale of the dangers they had escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 21]: These constant defeats stung the pride of the headquarters staff , and `` frightfulness '' was prescribed as the remedy .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 7]: The fact can not be disputed .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 42]: The invaders ' earliest offences might be explained , if not condoned , as the deeds of men brutalised by drink , but the wholesale ravaging of communities by regiments and brigades was the outcome of a deliberate policy of reprisal .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 11]: The Hun argument was convincing -- to the Hun intellect .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 12]: How dared these puny Belgians fight for their hearths and homes ?
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 13]: It was their place to grovel at the feet of the conqueror .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 36]: If any worn-out notions of honour and manhood and the sanctity of woman inspired them to take the field , they must be taught wisdom by being ground beneath the heel of the Prussian jack-boot .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 49]: If the dead mouths of five thousand murdered Belgians did not bear testimony against these disciplined marauders , the mere journey of the little party of men and women who set out from Verviers that Saturday afternoon would itself dispose of any attempt to cloak the high-placed offenders .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 7]: They arranged a rendezvous at Pepinster .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 4]: Dalroy went alone .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 7]: He insisted that this was advisable .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: Maertz brought Madame Joos and Irene .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 13]: Joos , having been besought to curb his tongue , convoyed Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 17]: Until Pepinster was reached , they took the main road , with its river of troops .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 5]: None gave them heed .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 10]: Not a man addressed an uncivil word to them .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 7]: The soldiers were cheery and well-behaved .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 12]: They halted that night at Louveigne , which was absolutely unscathed .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 17]: Next day they passed through Hamoir and Maffe , and the peasants were gathering the harvest !
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 20]: Huy and Andenne , a villager told them , were occupied by the Germans , but all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 22]: They pushed on , turning north-west from Maffe , and descended into the Meuse valley about six o'clock in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 31]: It was ominous that the bridge was destroyed and a cluster of houses burning in Seilles , a town on the opposite , or left , bank of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 15]: But Andenne itself , a peaceful and industrious place , seemed to be undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 29]: While passing a farm known as Dermine they fell in with a priest and a few Belgians who were carrying a mortally wounded Prussian officer on a stretcher .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 23]: Then , to his real chagrin , Dalroy heard that the Belgian outposts had been driven south and west only that morning .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 20]: One day less in Verviers , and he and the others would have been out of their present difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: However , he made the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 49]: Surely they could either cross the Meuse or reach Namur next day ; while the fact that some local residents were attending to the injured officer would supply the fugitives with an excellent safe-conduct into Andenne , just as a similar incident had been their salvation at Argenteau .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 33]: The stretcher was taken into the villa of a well-to-do resident ; and , it being still broad daylight , Joos asked to be directed to the house of Monsieur Alphonse Stauwaert .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 23]: The miller was acquainted with the topography of the town , but the Stauwaert family had moved recently to a new abode .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 16]: `` Barely two hundred mètres , _ tout droit _ , '' he was told .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 21]: They had gone part of the way when a troop of Uhlans came at the gallop along the Namur road .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 14]: The soldiers advanced in a pack , and were evidently in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 24]: Madame Joos was seated in the low-built , flat cart , drawn by two strong dogs , which had brought her from Verviers .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 6]: Maertz was leading the animals .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 12]: The other four were disposed on both sides of the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 15]: At the moment , no other person was nearer than some thirty yards ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 20]: Three men were standing there in the roadway , and they moved closer to the houses on the left .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 16]: Maertz , too , pulled his team on to the pavement on the same side .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 5]: The Uhlans came on .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 31]: Suddenly , without the slightest provocation , their leader swerved his horse and cut down one of the men , who dropped with a shriek of mingled fear and agony .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 23]: Retribution came swiftly , because the charger slipped on some rounded cobbles , crossed its forelegs , and turned a complete somersault .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 43]: The rider , a burly non-commissioned officer , pitched clean on his head , and either fractured his skull or broke his neck , perhaps achieving both laudable results , while his blood-stained sabre clattered on the stones at Dalroy 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 20]: The nearest Uhlans drove their lances through the other two civilians , who were already running for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 21]: In order to avoid the plunging horse and their fallen leader , the two ruffians reined on to the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 19]: They swung their weapons , evidently meaning to transfix some of the six people clustered around the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 5]: The women screamed shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 60]: Léontine cowered near the wall ; Joos , valiant soul in an aged body , put himself in front of his wife ; Maertz , hauling at the dogs , tried to convert the vehicle into a shield for Léontine ; while Dalroy , conscious that Irene was close behind , picked up the _ unteroffizier 's _ sword .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 40]: Much to the surprise of the trooper , who selected this tall peasant as an easy prey , he parried the lance-thrust in such wise that the blade entered the horse 's off foreleg and brought the animal down .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 27]: At the same instant Maertz ducked , and dodged a wild lunge , which missed because the Uhlan was trying to avoid crashing into the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 8]: But the vengeful steel found another victim .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 25]: By mischance it transfixed Madame Joos , while the horse 's shoulder caught Dalroy a glancing blow in the back and sent him sprawling .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 25]: Some of the troopers , seeing two of their men prone , were pulling up when a gruff voice cried , '' _ Achtung !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 10]: _ We 'll clear out these swine later ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 30]: Irene , who saw all that had passed with an extraordinary vividness , was the only one who understood why the order which undoubtedly saved five lives was given .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 32]: A stout staff officer , wearing a blue uniform with red facings , rode with the Uhlans , and she was certain that he was in a state of abject terror .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 31]: His funk was probably explained by an irregular volley lower down the street , though , in the event , the shooting proved to be that of his own men .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 41]: Two miles away , at Solayn , these same Uhlans had been badly bitten by a Belgian patrol , and the fat man , prospecting the Namur road with a cavalry escort , wanted no more unpleasant surprises that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 17]: Ostensibly , of course , he was anxious to report to a brigade headquarters at Huy .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 9]: At any rate , the Uhlans swept on .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 9]: They were gone when Dalroy regained his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 19]: A riderless horse was clattering after them ; another with a broken leg was vainly trying to rise .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 13]: Close at hand lay two Uhlans , one dead and one insensible .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 27]: Joos and Léontine were bending over the dying woman in the cart , making frantic efforts to stanch the blood welling forth from mouth and breast .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 27]: The lance had pierced her lungs , but she was conscious for a minute or so , and actually smiled the farewell she could not utter .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 17]: Maertz was swearing horribly , with the incoherence of a man just aroused from drunken sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 9]: Irene moved a few steps to meet Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 11]: Her face was marble white , her eyes strangely dilated .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 6]: `` Are you hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 7]: `` Untouched , thanks to you .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 10]: But those brutes have killed poor Madame Joos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 8]: The wounded Uhlan was stretched between them .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 7]: He stirred convulsively , and groaned .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 10]: Dalroy looked at the sword which he still held .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 13]: He resisted a great temptation , and sprang over the prostrate body .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 13]: He was about to say something when a ghastly object staggered past .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 17]: It was the man who received the sabre-cut , which had gashed his shoulder deeply . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 6]: _ Oh , mon Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 6]: _ '' he screamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 6]: _ Oh , mon Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 11]: _ '' He may have been making for some burrow .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 4]: They never knew .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 15]: He wailed that frenzied appeal as he shambled on -- always the same words .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 17]: He could think of nothing else but the last cry of despairing humanity to the All-Powerful .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 56]: Owing to the flight of the cavalry , Dalroy imagined that some body of allied troops , Belgian or French , was advancing from Namur , so he did not obey his first impulse , which was to enter the nearest house and endeavour to get away through the gardens or other enclosures in rear .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 20]: He glanced at the hapless body on the cart , and saw by the eyes that life had departed .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 5]: Léontine was sobbing pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 13]: Maertz , having recovered his senses , was striving to calm her .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 32]: But Joos remained silent ; he held his wife 's limp hand , and it was as though he awaited some reassuring clasp which should tell him that she still lived .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 11]: Dalroy had no words to console the bereaved old man .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 15]: He turned aside , and a mist obscured his vision for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 34]: Then he heard the wounded German hiccoughing , and he looked again at the sword , because this was the assassin who had foully murdered a gentle , kind-hearted , and inoffensive woman .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 11]: But he could not demean himself by becoming an executioner .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 32]: Richly as the criminal deserved to be sent with his victim to the bar of Eternal Justice , the Englishman decided to leave him to the avengers coming through the town .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 5]: The shooting drew nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 14]: A number of women and children , with a few men , appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 6]: They were running and screaming .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 32]: The first batch fled past ; but an elderly dame , spent with even a brief flurry , halted for a few seconds when she saw the group near the dog-team .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 5]: `` Henri Joos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 4]: `` And Léontine !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 13]: What , in Heaven 's name , are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 16]: It was Madame Stauwaert , the Andenne cousin with whom they hoped to find sanctuary .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 11]: The miller gazed at her in a curiously abstracted way .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 8]: `` Is that you , Margot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: `` We were coming to you .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 6]: But they have wounded Lise .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 2]: See !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 5]: Here she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 15]: Madame Stauwaert looked at the corpse as though she did not understand at first .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: Then she burst out hysterically , `` She 's dead , Henri !
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 5]: They 've killed her !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 7]: They 're killing all of us !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 14]: They pulled Alphonse out of the house and stabbed him with a bayonet .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 18]: They 're firing through the openings into the cellars and into the ground-floor rooms of every house .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 12]: If they see a face at a bedroom window they shoot .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 18]: Two Germans , so drunk that they could hardly stand , shot at me as I ran .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 6]: Ah , dear God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 8]: She swayed and sank in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: The flying crowd increased in numbers .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 7]: Some one shouted , `` Fools !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 7]: Be off , for your lives !
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 6]: Make for the quarries . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 10]: Dalroy decided to take this unknown friend 's advice .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 21]: The terrified people of Andenne had , at least , some definite goal in view , whereas he had none .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 15]: He lifted Madame Stauwaert and placed her beside the dead body on the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 17]: `` Come , '' he said to Maertz , `` get the dogs into a trot .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 17]: -- Léontine , look after your father , and do n't lose sight of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: He grasped Irene by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 41]: The tiny vehicle was flat and narrow , and he was so intent on preventing the unconscious woman from falling off into the road that he did not miss Joos and his daughter until Irene called on Maertz to stop .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 7]: `` Where are the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 8]: `` We must not desert them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 11]: In the midst of a scattered mob came the laggards .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 7]: Joos was not hurrying at all .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 5]: He was smiling horribly .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 10]: In his hand he held a large pocket-knife open .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 12]: `` It was all I had , '' he explained calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 15]: `` But Margot said Lise was dead , so it did his business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 9]: `` I 'm glad , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 6]: `` It was your privilege .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 30]: But you must run now , for Léontine 's sake , as she will not leave you , and the Germans may be on us at any moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 30]: Luckily , the stream of people swerved into a by-road ; the `` quarries '' of which some man had spoken opened up in the hillside close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 16]: On top were woods , and a cart-track led that way at a sharp gradient .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 15]: Dalroy assisted the dogs by pushing the cart , and they reached the summit .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 45]: Pausing there , while Irene and the weeping Léontine endeavoured to revive Madame Stauwaert , to whom they must look for some sort of guidance as to their next move , he went to the lip of the excavation , and surveyed the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 17]: Dusk was creeping over the picturesque valley , but the light still sufficed to reveal distances .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 16]: The railway station , with all the houses in the vicinity , was on fire .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 42]: Nearly every dwelling along the Namur road was ablaze ; while the trim little farms which rise , one above the other , on the terraced heights of the right bank of the Meuse seemed to have burst into flame spontaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 48]: Seilles , too , on the opposite bank , was undergoing the same process of wanton destruction ; but , a puzzling thing , rifles and machine-guns were busy on both sides of the river , and the flashes showed that a sharp engagement was taking place .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 23]: A man , carrying a child in his arms , who had come with them , was standing at Dalroy 's elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 11]: He appeared self-possessed enough , so the Englishman sought information .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 9]: `` Are those Belgian troops in Seilles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 4]: The man snorted .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 3]: `` Belgians ?
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 7]: They retreated to Namur this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: That is a Bavarian regiment shooting at Brandenburgers in Andenne .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 10]: They are all mad drunk , officers and men .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 14]: They 've been here since eleven o'clock , first Uhlans , then infantry .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 21]: The burgomaster met them fairly , not a shot was fired , and we thought we were over the worst .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 11]: Then , as you see , hell broke loose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 12]: Such was the refuge Andenne provided on Monday , 20th August .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 5]: Hell -- by order !
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 20]: CHAPTER XI A TRAMP ACROSS BELGIUM The stranger , a Monsieur Jules Pochard , proved a most useful friend .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 20]: In the first instance , he was a cool-headed person , who did not allow imagination to run riot .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 39]: `` No , '' he said , when questioned as to the chance of reaching Namur by a forced march along country lanes , `` every road in that section of the province is closed by cavalry patrols .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 8]: You can not avoid them , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 14]: Come with me to Huy , and you 'll be reasonably safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 18]: `` Why safer in Huy than here , or anywhere else where these brutes may be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 18]: `` Huy has been occupied by the Germans since the 12th , and is their temporary headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 11]: From what I gather , they usually spare such towns .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 12]: That is why we never dreamed of Andenne being sacked . ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 15]: Dalroy remembered the aged curé 's exposition of _ Kultur _ as a policy .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 13]: `` Is this sort of thing going on generally , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 6]: Monsieur Pochard was a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 5]: He raised his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 34]: `` Where can you have been , monsieur , not to know what has happened at Liège , Visé , Flemelle Grande , Blagny Trembleur , and a score of other places ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 4]: `` Visé ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 10]: broke in the cracked , piping voice of Joos .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 8]: `` What 's that about Visé ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 16]: `` It is burnt to the ground , and nearly all the inhabitants killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 22]: `` Is anything said of a fat major named Busch , whom Henri Joos the miller stuck with a fork ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 9]: `` A Prussian , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 10]: One of the same breed -- a Westphalian . ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 7]: `` I have n't heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 13]: `` He tried to assault my daughter , so I got him .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 19]: The second one , a Uhlan , killed my wife , and I got _ him _ too .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 11]: I cut his throat down there in the main street .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 7]: It 's easy to kill Germans .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 8]: They 're soft , like pigs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 14]: Though Joos 's half-demented boasting was highly injudicious , Dalroy did not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 10]: He was in a mood to let matters drift .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 7]: They could not well be worse .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 28]: He had tried to control the course of events in so far as they affected his own and Irene Beresford 's fortunes , but had failed lamentably .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 7]: Now , fate must take charge .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 12]: Pochard 's comment was to the point , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 11]: `` I congratulate you , monsieur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 22]: `` I 'll do a bit in that line myself when this little one is lodged with his aunt in Huy .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 21]: If every Belgian accounts for two Prussians , you 'll hold them till the French and English join up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 12]: `` Do you know for certain where the English are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 5]: put in Dalroy eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 6]: `` Yes , at Charleroi .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 6]: The French are in Namur .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 6]: Come with me to Huy .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 19]: A few days , and the _ sales Alboches _ will be pelting back to the Rhine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 17]: For the second time Dalroy heard a slang epithet new to him applied to the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 18]: He little guessed how familiar the abbreviated French form of the word would become in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 23]: Briton , Frenchman , Slav , and Italian have cordially adopted `` Boche '' as a suitable term for the common enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 13]: It has no meaning , yet conveys a sense of contemptuous dislike .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 10]: Stricken France had no heart for humour in 1870 .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 27]: The merciless foe was then a `` Prussian '' ; in 1914 he became a `` Boche , '' and the change held a comforting significance .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 37]: Dalroy , of course , did not share the Frenchman 's opinion as to the speedy discomfiture of the invader ; but night was falling , the offer of shelter was too good to be refused .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 11]: Nevertheless , he was careful to reveal a real difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 16]: `` Unfortunately , we have a dead woman in the cart , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 22]: `` Madame Stauwaert , too , is ill , but she has recovered from a fainting fit , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 7]: `` Ah , poor Stauwaert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 4]: murmured the other .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 5]: `` A decent fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 6]: I saw them kill him .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 9]: And that 's his wife , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 8]: I did n't recognise her before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 15]: Dalroy was relieved to find that the Frenchman and the bereaved woman were friends .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 23]: He had not forgotten the priest 's statement that there would be a spy in every group in that part of Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 49]: Later he ascertained that Monsieur Pochard was a well-to-do leather merchant in Andenne , who , like many others , refused to abandon a long-established business for fear of the Germans ; doubtless he was destined to pay a heavy price for his tenacity ere the war ended .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 24]: He behaved now as a true Samaritan , urging an immediate move , and promising even to arrange for Madame Joos 's burial .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 34]: Dalroy helped him to carry the child , a three-year-old boy , who was very sleepy and peevish , and did not understand why he should not be at home and in bed .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 10]: Joos suffered them to lead him where they listed .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 22]: He walked by the side of the cart , and told `` Lise '' how he had dealt with the Uhlan .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 16]: Léontine sobbed afresh , and tried to stop him , but he grew quite angry .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 8]: `` Why should n't she know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 3]: he snapped .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 9]: `` It is her affair , and mine .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 18]: You screamed , and turned away , but I hacked at him till his wind-pipe hissed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 14]: Monsieur Pochard brought them to Huy by a rough road among the hills .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 15]: It was a dreadful journey in the gloaming of a perfect summer 's evening .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 60]: The old man 's ghoulish jabbering , the sobs of the women , the panting of two exhausted dogs , and the wailing of the child , who wanted his father 's arms round him rather than a stranger 's , supplied a tragic chorus which ill beguiled that _ Via Dolorosa _ along the heights of the Meuse .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 19]: Irene insisted on taking the boy for a time , and the youngster ceased his plaint at once .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 13]: `` That 's a blessed relief , '' she confided to Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 23]: `` I 'm not afflicted with nerves , but this poor little chap 's crying was more than I could bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 16]: `` He is too heavy that you should carry him far , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 16]: `` You 're very much of a man , Arthur , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 22]: `` You do n't realise , I suppose , that nature gives us women strong arms for this very purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 8]: `` I had n't thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 8]: The fact is , I 'm worried .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 21]: I have a doubt at the back of my head that we ought to be going the other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 6]: `` Which other way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 8]: `` In precisely the opposite direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 7]: `` But what can we do ?
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 20]: At what stage in our wanderings up to this very moment could we have parted company with our friends ?
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 23]: Do you know , I have a horrible feeling that we have brought a good deal of avoidable misery on their heads ?
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 33]: If we had n't gone to the mill -- '' `` They would probably all have been dead by this time , and certainly both homeless and friendless , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 22]: Then he began telling her the fate of Visé , but was brought up short by an imperative whisper from Pochard .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 14]: They were talking English , without realising it , and Huy was near .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 8]: `` And why carry that sword ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 4]: added the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 9]: `` It is useless , and most dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 7]: Thrust it into a ditch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 4]: Dalroy obeyed promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 20]: He had thoughtlessly disregarded the sinister outcome if a patrol found him with such a weapon in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 22]: They came to Huy by a winding road through a suburb , meeting plenty of soldiers strolling to and from billets .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 8]: Luck befriended them at this ticklish moment .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 25]: None saw a little party turning into a lane which led to the back of the villa tenanted by Monsieur Pochard 's married sister .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 8]: This lady proved both sympathetic and helpful .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 31]: The cart , with its sad freight , was housed in a wood-shed at the bottom of the garden , and the dogs were stabled in the gardener 's potting-shed .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 16]: `` The ladies can share my bedroom and my daughter 's , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 18]: `` You men must sleep in the greenhouse , as every remaining room is filled with Uhlans .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: Their supper is ready now , but there is plenty .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 7]: Come and eat before they arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 10]: They left on patrol duty early this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 14]: And that is where the fugitives experienced a stroke of amazing good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 8]: That particular batch of Uhlans never returned .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 15]: It was supposed that they were cut off while scouting along the Tirlemont road .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 18]: Apparently their absence only contributed to an evening of quiet talk and a night of undisturbed rest .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 19]: In reality , it saved the lives of the whole party , including the hostess and her family .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 21]: Early next morning Monsieur Pochard interviewed an undertaker , and Madame Joos was laid to rest in the nearest cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 11]: Maertz , Madame Stauwaert , and Léontine attended the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 6]: Joos showed signs of collapse .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 4]: His mind wandered .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 11]: He thought his wife was living , and in Verviers .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 12]: They encouraged the delirium , and dosed him with a narcotic .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 12]: Irene helped in the kitchen , and Dalroy dug the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 27]: Thus , the confederacy remained split up during the morning , and was not noticed by an officer who came to inquire about the missing Uhlans .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 8]: About noon Monsieur Pochard drew Dalroy aside .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 30]: `` Monsieur , '' he said , and his face wore anxious lines , `` last night the old man implied that he was Henri Joos , of Visé .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 5]: No , please listen .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 8]: I do n't want to be told .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 17]: I can only give you certain facts , and leave you to draw your own conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 29]: Active inquiries are being made by the authorities for Henri Joos , Elisabeth Joos , Léontine Joos , their daughter , and Jan Maertz , all of Visé .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 21]: With them are an Englishwoman aged twenty , and an English officer named Dalroy , both dressed as Belgian peasants .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 23]: The appended descriptions seem to be remarkably accurate , and a reward of one thousand marks is offered for their capture . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 17]: `` They may be willing to pay double the price for freedom , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 6]: The Frenchman was not offended .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 13]: He realised that this was not a suggestion of a personal bribe .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 11]: `` You have not heard all , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 28]: `` These people were traced to Verviers , but the trail was lost after Maertz bought a cart and a dog-team in that town three days ago .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 25]: Unfortunately , some Uhlans , passing through Andenne last night , have reported the presence of just such a party on the main road .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 30]: Other soldiers believe they saw a similar lot entering Huy after dark , and the burgomaster is warned that the strictest search must be made among refugees at Huy .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: To make sure , a German escort will assist .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 34]: It is estimated that Joos and the others will be caught , because they will probably depend on a _ laisser passer _ issued in Argenteau under false names , which are known .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 9]: Joos figures as Wilhelm Schultz , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 8]: Do n't look so surprised , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 8]: The burgomaster is my brother-in-law 's partner .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 16]: He will not reach this quarter of Huy till half-past three or four o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 18]: `` But there is the record of Madame Joos 's burial , '' put in Dalroy instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 13]: The poor creature remains a ` woman unknown , found dead . '
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 9]: The Germans do n't worry about such trifles .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 17]: But , by a strange coincidence , Madame Stauwaert practically takes her place for identification purposes .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 28]: By the mercy of Providence , no German soldier was in this house last night , or he would now be the richer by a thousand marks .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 19]: The notice is placarded at the _ Kommandantur _ , and is being read by the multitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 25]: `` We shall not bring further trouble on a family which has already run grave risk in our behalf , '' vowed Dalroy warmly .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 16]: `` We must scatter at once , and , if caught , suffer individually . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 20]: `` I was sure you would say that , monsieur ; but sworn allies carry friendship to greater lengths .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 7]: Now , let us take counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 6]: Madame Stauwaert can remain here .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 9]: Fifty people in Huy will answer for her .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 9]: My sister can hire a servant , Léontine .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 15]: If Joos is tractable he can lodge in safety with some cottagers I know .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 25]: Maertz wishes to join the Belgian army , and you the British ; while that charming young lady will want to get to England .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 12]: Well , we may be able to contrive all these things .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 36]: I happen to be a bit of an antiquary , and Huy owns more ruined castles and monasteries than any other town of similar size in Belgium , or in the world , I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 15]: Follow my instructions to the letter , and you will cheat the Germans yet .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 9]: They are animals of habit and cast-iron rule .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 14]: When searching for six people they will never look for one or two .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 18]: Yet it would be folly if you and mademoiselle wandered off by yourselves in a strange country .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 43]: Then , indeed , even German official obtuseness might show a spark of real intelligence ; whereas , by gaining a few days , who knows whether your armies may not come to you , rather than you go to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 10]: The good-hearted Frenchman 's scheme worked without a hitch .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 46]: The cart was broken up for firewood , the harness burnt , and the dogs taken a mile into the country by Maertz , who sold them for a couple of francs , and came back to a certain ruined priory by a roundabout road .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 8]: Irene and Dalroy had gone there already .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 18]: The place lay deep in trees and brushwood , and was approachable by a dozen hidden ways .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 51]: Although given over to bats and owls , its tumbledown walls contained one complete room , situated some twenty feet above the ground level , and reached by a winding staircase of stone slabs , which looked most precarious , but proved quite sound if used by a sure-footed climber .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 11]: Here , then , the three dwelt eleven weary days .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 17]: During daylight their only diversion was the flight of hosts of aeroplanes toward the French frontier .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 5]: Twice they saw Zeppelins .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 23]: For warmth at night they depended on horse-rugs and bundles of a species of bracken which throve among the piles of stones .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 31]: They were well supplied with food , deposited at dusk in a fosse , and obtained when the opening bars of `` La Brabançonne '' were whistled at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 24]: The air itself was a guarantee that no German was near , because the Belgian national anthem is not pleasing to Hun ears .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 15]: A typed note in the basket formed their sole link with the outer world .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 12]: And what momentous issues were conveyed in the briefest of sentences !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 17]: `` Namur has fallen after a day 's bombardment by a new and terrible cannon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 8]: `` Brussels has capitulated without resistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 18]: `` After a fierce battle , the French and English have retired from Charleroi and Mons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 5]: `` The retreat continues .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 4]: France is invaded .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 5]: Valenciennes has fallen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 16]: On the eleventh morning Dalroy hid among the bushes until the daily basket was brought .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 7]: Monsieur Pochard himself was the go-between .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 22]: He feared lest Léontine would contrive to meet Maertz , so the girl did not know where her lover was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 24]: The Frenchman started visibly when Dalroy 's voice reached him ; but the latter spoke in a tone which would not carry far .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 19]: `` I 'm sorry to seem ungrateful , '' he said , `` but we are growing desperate .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 17]: Do us one last favour , monsieur , and we impose no more on your goodness .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 19]: Tell me where and when we can cross the Meuse , and the best route to take subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 27]: Sink or swim , I , at any rate , must endeavour to reach England , and mademoiselle is equally resolved to make the attempt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 13]: `` I do n't blame you , '' came the sorrowful reply .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 10]: `` This is going to be a long war .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 9]: Twenty years of deadly preparation are bearing fruit .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 6]: I am sick with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 29]: But I dare not loiter in this neighbourhood , so , as to your affair , my advice is that you cross the Meuse to-morrow in broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 13]: The bridge is repaired , and no very strict watch is kept .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 9]: Make for Nivelles , Enghien , and Oudenarde .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: The Belgians hold the Antwerp-Gand-Roulers line , but are being driven back daily .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 7]: I have been thinking of you .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 19]: If you delay longer you will -- at the best -- be imprisoned in Belgium for many months .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 5]: Are you determined ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 7]: `` Do you want money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 6]: `` We have plenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 12]: `` Farewell , then , and may God protect you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 12]: `` Is there no chance of nearing the British force ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: was Dalroy 's final and almost despairing question .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 5]: `` Not the least .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 14]: You would be following on the heels of a quick-moving and victorious army .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 7]: Progress is slower toward the coast .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 12]: You have a fighting chance that way , none the other .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 5]: Good-bye , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 8]: `` Good-bye , best of friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 29]: The sudden collapse of Namur , and the consequent failure of the Anglo-French army 's initial scheme , had served to alter this shrewd man 's opinion completely .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 9]: His confidence was gone , his nerve shaken .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 10]: The pressure of the jack-boot was heavy upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 36]: Dalroy was certain that he walked away with a furtive haste , being in mortal fear lest the people he had helped so greatly might put forth some additional request which he dared not grant .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 21]: Next morning they left the priory grounds separately , and strolled into the town , keeping some fifty yards apart .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 38]: It was only after a struggle that Jan Maertz relinquished the notion of trying to see Léontine before going from Huy , but the others convinced him that he might imperil both the girl and their benefactors .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 38]: As matters stood , her greatest danger must have nearly vanished by this time ; it would be a lamentable thing if her lover were arrested , and it became known that he had visited the villa .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 7]: They crossed the river on pontoons .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 9]: The Germans were already rebuilding the stone bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 10]: They seemed to have men to spare for everything .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 35]: That the bridge was being actually rebuilt , and not made practicable by timber-work only , impressed Dalroy more forcibly than any other fact gleaned during his Odyssey in a Belgium under German rule .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 27]: There was no thought of relinquishing the occupied territory , no hint of doubt that it might be wrested from their clutch in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 22]: He noticed that the post-office , the railway station , the parcels vans , even the street names , were Germanised .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 34]: He learnt subsequently that the schools had been taken over by German teachers , while the mere sound of French in a shop or public place was scowled at if not absolutely forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 27]: There were not many troops on the roads , but crowded troop-trains passed on both sides of the Meuse , and ever in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 18]: Two long hospital trains came from the south-west , and Dalroy knew what _ that _ meant .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 21]: Another long train of closed wagons , heavily laden , as a panting engine testified , perplexed him , however .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 33]: He spoke of it to Maertz , the three being on the road in company as they climbed the hill to Heron , and the carter promptly sought information from a farmer .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: The man eyed them carefully .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 7]: `` Where are you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 6]: he demanded in true Flemish .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 10]: `` What has that to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 10]: grinned Maertz , in the same _ patois _ .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 5]: The questioner was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 9]: He jerked a thumb toward the French frontier .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 5]: `` Dead uns ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 10]: `` They 're killing Germans like flies down yonder .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 38]: They ca n't bury them -- have n't time -- so they tie the corpses together , slinging four on a pole for easy handling , ship them to Germany , and chuck them into furnaces . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 18]: `` So , '' guffawed Maertz , `` the swine know where they are going then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 18]: To Dalroy 's secret amazement , Irene , who understood each word , laughed with the others .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 13]: Campaigning had not coarsened , but it had undeniably hardened her nature .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 19]: A month ago she would have shuddered at sight of these dun trucks , with their ghastly freight .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 16]: Now , so long as they only contained Germans , she surveyed them with interest .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 26]: `` Allowing forty bodies to one wagon , '' she said , `` there are over a thousand dead men in that train alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 5]: The farmer spat approval .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 29]: `` I 've been busy , and have missed some ; but that 's the tenth lot which has gone east this morning , '' he remarked cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 10]: `` Is the road to Nivelles fairly open ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 5]: Dalroy ventured to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 5]: `` One never knows .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 11]: Anyhow , always give the next village as your destination .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 8]: If doubtful , travel by night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 6]: This counsel was well meant .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 22]: In the silent bitterness of hours yet to come , Dalroy recalled it , and wished he had profited by it .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 27]: Roughly speaking , they had set out on a fifty miles ' tramp , which the men could have tackled in two days , or less .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 37]: But the presence of Irene lowered the scale , and Dalroy apportioned matters so that twelve miles daily formed their programme , with , as the _ entrepreneurs _ say , power to increase or curtail .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 34]: Thus , that first afternoon , the date being September 2nd , they pulled up at Gembloux , quite a small place , finding supper and beds in a farm beyond the village .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 46]: Next day they pushed ahead through Nivelles , and entered the forest of Soignies , that undulating woodland on which Wellington depended for the protection of a dangerous flank during the unavoidable retreat to the coast if Napoleon had beaten the British army at Waterloo .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 21]: Dalroy explained the Iron Duke 's strategy to Irene as they paced a road which provides an ideal walking tour .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 31]: `` That a General was not worth his salt who did not secure the track of his army if defeated was one of his fixed principles , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 18]: `` He would never depart from it , and his dispositions at Waterloo were based on it .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 18]: In fact , his solicitude in that respect nearly caused a row between him and Blücher . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 11]: `` Let me see , '' mused the girl aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 16]: `` The Germans have never fought the British in modern times until this war . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 6]: `` That is correct . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: `` And how far away is Mons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: Dalroy smiled at the thought which had evidently occurred to her .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 11]: `` We are now just half-way between Mons and Waterloo .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 8]: Each is about ten miles distant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 17]: `` We were allied then with the Belgians , Germans , and Russians against the French .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 15]: Now we have joined the Belgians , French , and Russians against the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 10]: It sounds like counting in a game of cribbage .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 22]: A hundred years from to-day our combination may be with the Belgians , Germans , and French against the Russians . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 16]: `` You must n't even hint treason against our present Allies , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 5]: `` What are Allies ?
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 6]: Of what avail are treaties ?
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: You men have mismanaged things woefully .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 12]: It is high time women took a lead in governing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 3]: `` Awful !
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 10]: I do verily believe you are a suffragette . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 4]: `` I am .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 8]: During what periods has England been greatest ?
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 9]: In the reigns of Elizabeth and Victoria . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: `` Why leave out poor Queen Anne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 8]: `` She was a very excellent woman .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 36]: As soon as she came to the throne she declared her resolution ` not to follow the example of her predecessors in making use of a few of her subjects to oppress the rest . '
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 29]: The common people do n't err in their estimate of rulers , and they knew what they were about in christening her ` Good Queen Anne . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 7]: `` Now I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 6]: `` Sure of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 14]: `` You have never told me what you were doing in Berlin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 12]: `` You have n't asked me , '' she broke in .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 5]: `` Did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 23]: I -- '' Irene 's intuition warned her that this harmless chatter had swung round with lightning rapidity to a personal issue .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 40]: Sad to relate , she had not washed her face or hands for eleven days , so a blush told no tales ; but she interrupted again rather nervously , `` What is it you are sure of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 14]: `` You must have been a governess-companion in some German family of position .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 7]: I can foresee a trying future .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 12]: I must brush up my dates , or lose caste forever .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 21]: Is n't there a doggerel jingle beginning : `` In fifty-five and fifty-four Came Cæsar o'er to Britain 's shore ?
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 15]: `` If I learn it , it may save me many a trip . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 21]: `` Here , you two , '' growled Jan Maertz , `` talk a language a fellow can understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 16]: The road was deserted save for themselves , and the others had unconsciously spoken English .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 25]: Dalroy turned to apologise to their rough but trusty friend , and thus missed the quizzical and affectionate glance which Irene darted at him .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 11]: She was still smiling when next he caught her eye .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 7]: `` What is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 20]: `` I was thinking how difficult it is to see a wood for the trees , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 5]: Maertz took her literally .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 20]: `` I 'll be glad when we 're in the open country again , mademoiselle , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: `` I do n't like this forest .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 13]: One ca n't guess what may be hiding round the corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 18]: Yet they stopped that night at Brainé le Comte , and crossed Enghien next day without incident .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 15]: It is a pity that such a glorious ramble should be described so baldly .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 42]: In happier times , when Robert Louis Stevenson took that blithe journey through the Cevennes with a donkey , a similar excursion produced a book which will be read when the German madness has long been relegated to a detested oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 35]: But Uhlan pickets and `` square-head '' sentries supply wretched sign-posts in a land of romance , and the wanderers were now in a region where each kilomètre had to be surveyed with caution .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 32]: Maertz owned an aunt in every village , and careful inquiry had , of course , located one of these numerous relatives in Lierde , a hamlet on the Grammont-Gand road .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 29]: Oudenarde was strongly held by the enemy , but the roads leading to Gand were the scene of magnificent exploits by the armoured cars of the Belgian army .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 12]: Certain Belgian motorists had become national heroes during the past fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 27]: An innkeeper in Grammont told with bated breath how one famous driver , helped by a machine-gun crew , was accounting for scores of marauding cavalrymen .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 23]: `` The English and French are beaten , but our fellows are holding them , '' he said with a fine air .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 11]: `` When you boys get through you 'll enjoy life .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 24]: My nephew , who used to be a great _ chasseur _ , says there is no sport like chasing mounted Boches . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 50]: This frank recognition of Dalroy as one of the innumerable young Belgians then engaged in crossing the enemy 's lines in order to serve with their brothers was an unwitting compliment to a student who had picked up the colloquial phrases and Walloon words in Maertz 's uncouth speech .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 20]: A man who looked like an unkempt peasant should speak like one , and Dalroy was an apt scholar .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: He never trod on doubtful ground .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 15]: Strangers regarded him as a taciturn person , solely because of this linguistic restraint .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 14]: Maertz made nearly all inquiries , and never erred in selecting an informant .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 12]: The truth was that German spies were rare in this district .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 43]: They were common as crows in the cities , and on the frontiers of Belgium and France , but rural Brabant harboured few , and that simple fact accounts for the comparatively slow progress of the invaders as they neared the coast .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 25]: It was at a place called Oombergen , midway between Oudenarde and Alost , that the fugitives met the Death 's - Head Hussars .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 10]: And with that ill-omened crew came the great adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 65]: CHAPTER XII AT THE GATES OF DEATH Had Dalroy followed his own plans , supported as they were by the well-meant advice tendered by the farmer of the Meuse valley , he might have led his companions through the final barrier without incurring any risk at all comparable with the hair 's - breadth escapes of Visé , Argenteau , Andenne , and Huy .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 5]: But the weather broke .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 31]: Rain fell in torrents , and Irene 's presence was a real deterrent to spending a night in a ditch or lurking in the depths of a wood till dawn .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 27]: Maertz , too , jubilant in the certainty that the Belgian outposts were hardly six miles distant , advocated the bold policy of a daylight march .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 32]: Still , there was no excuse for Dalroy , who knew that patrols in an enemy 's country are content to stand fast by night , and scout during the day .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 15]: Unluckily , Irene was eager as their Belgian friend to rush the last stage .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 11]: She was infected by the prevalent spirit of the people .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 18]: Throughout the whole of September these valiant folk in the real Flanders held the Germans rather cheap .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 38]: They did not realise that outpost affairs are not battles -- that a cavalry screen , as its very name implies , is actually of more value in cloaking movements of armies in rear than in reconnoitring .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 48]: Be that as it may , in the late afternoon of 5th September the three were hurrying past some lounging troopers who had taken shelter from the pouring rain in the spacious doorway of a ruined barn , when one man called to them , `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: where are you off to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 19]: They pretended not to hear , whereupon a bullet passed through Dalroy 's smock between arm and ribs .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 10]: It was useless to think of bolting from cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 13]: They turned at once , hoping that a bold front might serve .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 9]: This occurred a mile or more from Oombergen .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 17]: Maertz had `` an aunt '' in Oosterzeele , the next village , and said so .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 43]: `` If she 's anything like you , you 're welcome to her ; but let 's have a look at your cousin , '' grinned the German , striding forward , carbine in hand , and grasping Irene by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 18]: `` You stop here , _ Fräulein _ -- or , is it _ Frau _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 9]: he said , with a vilely suggestive leer .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 8]: `` Anyhow , it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 17]: If one of these pig-heads is your husband we can soon make you a widow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 18]: Now to Irene every German soldier was a boor , with a boor 's vices and limitations .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 36]: The man , a corporal , spoke and acted coarsely , using the _ argot _ of the barrack-room , and she was far too frightened to see in his satyr-like features a certain intellectuality .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 10]: So , in her distress , she blundered twice .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 6]: `` Leave me alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 14]: she said shrilly , trying in voice and manner to copy Léontine Joos .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 27]: `` Now do n't be coy , pretty one , '' chuckled the trooper , beginning to urge her forcibly in the direction of the barn .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 13]: Dalroy and Jan Maertz had remained stock-still when the hussar came up .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 26]: Suddenly the Belgian sheered off , and ran like a hare into the dense wood surrounding the small cleared space in which stood the barn .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 11]: The building had evidently been meant to house stock only .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 6]: There was no dwelling attached .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: It had served , too , as a rallying-point during some recent scrimmage .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 39]: The outer walls were chipped with bullets ; the doors had been torn off and burnt ; it was typical of Belgium under German rule -- a husk given fictitious life by the conqueror 's horses and men .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 13]: Irene had seen Jan make off , while Dalroy lurched slowly nearer .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 35]: She could not hear the fierce whisper which bade their sturdy ally bolt for the trees , and , if he got away , implore a strong Belgian patrol to come to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 31]: But she knew that _ some _ daring expedient had been devised on the spur of the moment , and gathered all her resources for an effort to gain time .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 9]: The corporal heard Jan break into a run .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 15]: Letting go the girl , he swung on his heel and raised the carbine .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 8]: Dalroy had foreseen that this might happen .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 26]: With a calm courage that was superb because of its apparent lack of thought , he had placed himself in the direct line of fire .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 31]: Standing with his hands in his pockets and laughing loudly , he first glanced over his shoulder at the vanishing Maertz , and then guffawed into the hussar 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 8]: `` He 's done a bunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 4]: he cried cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 28]: `` You said he might go , _ Herr Unteroffizier _ , so he hopped it without even saying ' _ Auf wieder sehn _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 20]: Meanwhile , as he was steadily masking the German 's aim , he might have been shot without warning .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 26]: But the ready comment baffled the other for a few precious seconds , and the men in the barn helped unconsciously by chaffing their comrade .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 17]: `` You 've got your hands full with the girl , Franz , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 7]: `` What 's she like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 3]: bawled another .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 16]: `` I can only see a pair of slim ankles and a dirty face . ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 28]: `` That 's all you _ will _ see , Georg , '' said Franz , believing that a scared Belgian peasant had merely bolted in panic .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 12]: `` This little bit is mine by the laws of war .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 21]: -- Here , you , '' he added , surveying Dalroy quite amicably , `` be off to your aunt !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 18]: You 'll probably be shot at Oosterzeele ; but that 's your affair , not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 12]: `` You do n't know my aunt , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 22]: `` I 'd sooner face a regiment of soldiers than stand her tongue if I go home without her niece . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 17]: If he hoped to placate this swaggering scoundrel by a display of good-humour he failed lamentably .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 18]: An ugly glint shone in the man 's eyes , and he handled the carbine again threateningly .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 10]: `` To hell with you and your aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 3]: he snarled .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 23]: `` Perhaps you do n't know it , you Flemish fool , but you 're a German now and must obey orders .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 17]: Cut after your pal before I count three , or I 'll put daylight through you !
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 39]: One , two -- '' Then the hapless Irene committed a second and fatal error , though it was pardonable in the frenzy of a tragic dilemma , since the next moment might see her lover ruthlessly murdered .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 38]: To lump all German soldiers into one category was a bad mistake ; it was far worse to change her accent from the crude speech of the province of Liège to the high-sounding periods of Berlin society .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 12]: `` How dare you threaten unoffending people in this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 4]: she almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 34]: `` I demand that you send for an officer , and I ask the other men of your regiment to bear witness we have done nothing whatsoever to warrant your brutal behaviour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 18]: The hussar stood as though he , and not Dalroy , had been silenced by a bullet .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 24]: He listened to the girl 's outburst with an expression of blank amazement , which soon gave place to a sinister smile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 27]: _ Gnädiges Fräulein _ , '' he answered , springing to `` attention , '' and affecting a conscience-stricken tone , `` I cry your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 8]: But is it not your own fault ?
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 14]: Why should such a charming young lady masquerade as a Belgian peasant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 28]: On hearing the man speak as a well-educated Berliner , Irene became deathly white under the tan and grime of so many days and nights of exposure .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 14]: She nearly fainted , and might have fallen had not Dalroy caught her .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 42]: Even then , when their position was all but hopeless , he made one last attempt to throw dust in the crafty eyes which were now piercing both Irene and himself with the baneful glare of a tiger about to spring .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 15]: `` My cousin has been a governess in Berlin , '' he said deferentially .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 21]: `` She is n't afraid of soldiers as a rule , but you have nearly frightened her to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 17]: Their captor still examined them in a way that chilled even the Englishman 's dauntless heart .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 36]: He was summing them up , much as a detective might scan the features of a pair of half-recognised criminals to whom he could not altogether allot their proper places in the Rogues ' Gallery .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 12]: `` You see , she 's ill , '' urged Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 6]: `` May n't we go ?
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 7]: My aunt keeps a decent cellar .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 10]: I 'll come back with some good wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 18]: Never relaxing that glowering scrutiny , the corporal shouted suddenly , `` Come here , Georg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 9]: The man thus hailed by name strode forward .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 22]: With him came three others , Irene 's fluent German and the parade attitude assumed by Franz having aroused their curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 17]: `` You used to have a good memory for descriptions of ` wanteds , ' Georg .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 27]: Can you recall the names and appearance of the English captain and the girl there was such a fuss about at Argenteau a month ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 11]: Georg , a strongly-built , rather jovial-looking Hanoverian , grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 19]: `` Better than leaving things to guess-work , I have it in my pocket , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 10]: `` I copied it at the _ Kommandantur _ .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 12]: A thousand marks are worth a pencilled note , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 8]: Halves , if these are they ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 13]: Dalroy knew then that he , and possibly Irene , were doomed .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 5]: A struggle was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 20]: Franz 's reference to Oosterzeele being in German occupation forbade the least hope of succour by a Belgian force .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 22]: There was a hundred to one chance that Irene 's life might be spared , and he resolved to take it .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 18]: It was pitiful to feel the girl trembling , and he gave her arm an encouraging squeeze .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 21]: Georg was fumbling in the breast of his tunic , when he seemed to realise that it was raining heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 19]: `` Why the devil stand out here if we 're going to hold a court of inquiry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 20]: Evidently , the iron discipline of the German army was somewhat relaxed in the Death 's - Head Hussars .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 10]: `` Go to the barn , '' commanded Franz .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 20]: `` And , mind , you pig of an Englishman , no talking till you 're spoken to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 22]: Dalroy wondered why the man allowed him to assist Irene ; but such passing thoughts were as straws in a whirlwind .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 9]: He bent his wits to the one problem .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 4]: He was lost .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 5]: Could he save her ?
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 5]: Heaven alone would decide .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 14]: A poor mortal might only pray for guidance as to the right course .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 26]: Inside the tumbledown barn the light was bad , so the prisoners were halted in the doorway , and a score of troopers gathered around .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 12]: They were not , on the whole , a ruffianly set .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 33]: Every man bore the stamp of a trained soldier ; the device of a skull and cross-bones worked in white braid on their hussar caps gave them an imposing and martial aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 6]: `` Here you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 12]: announced the burly Georg , producing a frayed sheet of paper .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 11]: `` Let 's see -- there 's six of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 13]: Henri Joos , miller , aged sixty-five , five feet three inches .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 9]: Elizabeth Joos , his wife , aged forty-five .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 23]: Léontine Joos , daughter , aged nineteen , plump , good-looking , black eyes and hair , clear complexion , red cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 20]: Jan Maertz , carter , aged twenty-six , height five feet eight inches , a Walloon , strongly built .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 31]: Arthur Dalroy , captain in British army , about six feet in height , of athletic physique , blue eyes , brown hair , very good teeth , regular features .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 21]: An English girl , name unknown , aged about twenty , very good-looking , and of elegant appearance and carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 9]: Eyes believed brown , and hair dark brown .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 8]: Fairly tall and slight , but well-formed .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 11]: These latter -LRB- the English -RRB- speak German and French .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 12]: The girl , in particular , uses good German fluently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 4]: `` Click ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: ejaculated Franz , imitating the snapping of a pair of handcuffs .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 28]: `` Shave that fellow , and rig out the lady in her ordinary togs , and you 've got them to the dots on the i 's .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 9]: Who are the first two for patrol ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 6]: A couple of men answered .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 28]: `` Sorry , boys , '' went on Franz briskly , `` but you must hoof it to Oosterzeele , and lay Jan Maertz by the heels .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 7]: You saw him , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 10]: You may even pick him up on the road .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 9]: If you do , bring him back here .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 24]: -- Georg , ride into Oombergen , show an officer that extract from the Argenteau notice , and get hold of a transport .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 9]: These prisoners are of the utmost importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 16]: Irene , who lost no syllable of this direful investigation , had recovered her self-control .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 5]: She turned to Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 19]: Her eyes were shining with the light which , in a woman , could have only one meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 7]: `` Forgive me , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 8]: `` I fear I am to blame .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 4]: I was selfish .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 19]: I might have saved _ you _ -- '' `` No , no , none of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: interrupted the corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 9]: `` You go inside , _ Fräulein _ .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 11]: You can sit on a broken ladder near the door .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 7]: The horses wo n't hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 21]: -- As for you , Mr. Captain , you 're a slippery fellow , so we 'll hobble you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 16]: Dalroy knew it was useless to do other than fall in with the orders given .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 16]: He did not try to answer Irene , but merely looked at her and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 6]: Was ever smile more eloquent ?
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 12]: It was at once a message of undying love and farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 9]: Possibly , he might never see her again .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 36]: But the bitterness of approaching death , enhanced as it was by the knowledge that he should not have allowed himself to drift blindly into this open net , was assuaged in one vital particular .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 15]: The woman he loved was absolutely safe now from a set of licentious brutes .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 8]: She might be given life and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 31]: When brought before some responsible military court he would tell the plain truth , suppressing only such facts as would tend to incriminate their good friends in Verviers and Huy .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 39]: Not even a board of German officers could find the girl guilty of killing Busch and his companions , and this , he imagined , was the active cause of the hue and cry raised by the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 16]: How determined the hunt had been was shown by the changed demeanour of the corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 12]: The man was almost oppressed by the magnitude of the capture .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 14]: Dalroy was convinced that it was not the monetary reward which affected him .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 22]: Probably this young non-commissioned officer saw certain promotion ahead , and that , to a German , is an all-sufficing inducement .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 32]: The prisoner 's hands were tied behind his back , and the same rope was adjusted around waist and ankles in such wise that movement was limited to moderately short steps .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 9]: But Herr Franz did not hurt him needlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 10]: Rather was he bent on taking care of him .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 32]: Throwing a cavalry cloak over the Englishman 's shoulders , he said , `` You can squat against the wall and keep out of the rain , if you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 6]: Dalroy obeyed without a word .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 5]: He felt inexplicably weary .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 11]: In that unhappy hour body and soul alike were crushed .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 6]: But the cloud lifted soon .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 19]: His spirit was the spirit of the immortals ; it raised itself out of the slough of despond .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 24]: The day was closing in rapidly ; lowering clouds and steady rain conspired to rob the sun of some part of his prerogatives .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 19]: At seven o'clock it would be dark , whereas the almanac fixed the close of day at eight .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 7]: It was then about half-past six .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 23]: Resolutely casting off the torpor which had benumbed his brain after parting from the woman he loved , Dalroy looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 31]: The hussars , some twenty all told , reduced now to seventeen , since the messengers had ridden off without delay , were gathered in a knot around the corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 15]: Some of their horses were tethered in the barn , others were picketed outside .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 6]: Scraps of talk reached him .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 13]: `` This will be a plume in your cap , Franz . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 14]: `` A thousand marks , picked up in a filthy hole like this !
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 3]: _ Almächtig !
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 7]: _ '' `` What are they ?
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 3]: Spies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 6]: `` Did n't you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 9]: They stabbed Major Busch with a stable fork .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 10]: Jolly old Busch -- one of the best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 15]: `` And bayoneted two officers of the Westphalian commissariat , wounding a third . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 4]: `` The devil !
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 6]: Was there a fight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 16]: `` Some of the fellows said Busch and the others must have been drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 4]: `` Quite likely .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 8]: I was drunk every day then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 5]: A burst of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 6]: `` Lucky dog ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 5]: _ Ach , was !
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: _ what 's the good of having been drunk so long ago ?
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 13]: There is n't a bottle of wine now within five miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 18]: `` Tell us then , _ Herr Kaporal _ , do we remain here till dawn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 5]: Dalroy grew faintly interested .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 34]: It was absurd to harbour the slightest expectation of Jan Maertz bringing succour , but one might at least analyse the position , though the only visible road led straight to a firing-party .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 10]: `` Those were our orders , '' answered Franz .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 7]: `` Things may be altered now .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 12]: You fellows have n't grasped the real value of this cop .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 34]: It was n't stated on the notice , but somebody of much more importance than any ordinary officer was interested in the girl being caught -- she far more than the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 3]: Tastes differ !
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 6]: A peasant like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 10]: `` You silly ass , she 's no peasant .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 10]: That 's the worst of living in a suburb .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 8]: You acquire no standard of comparison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 27]: These men were Berliners , and were amused by a sly dig at some locality which , like Koepenick , offered a butt for German humour .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 3]: `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 7]: is n't that a car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 3]: said one .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 4]: There was silence .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 16]: The thrumming of a powerful automobile could be heard through the patter of the rain .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 4]: `` Attention ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 3]: growled Franz .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 9]: A few troopers went to the picketed horses .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 5]: The others lined up .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 5]: A closed motor-car arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 20]: Its brilliant head-lights proclaimed the certain fact that the presence of Belgian troops in that locality was not feared .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 18]: Dalroy recognised this at once , and forthwith dismissed from his mind the last shred of hope .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 6]: The chauffeur was a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 9]: By his side sat the usual armed escort .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 4]: Georg galloped up .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 30]: Oombergen was only a mile and a half distant , and the road through the wood was in such a condition that the car was compelled to travel slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 5]: A cloaked staff-officer alighted .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 9]: The hussars stood stiff as so many ramrods .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 19]: The new-comer took their salute punctiliously , but his tone in addressing the corporal was far from gracious .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 14]: `` What 's this unlikely tale you 've sent in to headquarters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 4]: he demanded harshly .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 19]: `` I do n't think I 'm mistaken , _ Herr Hauptmann _ , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 14]: `` I 've got that English captain and the lady wanted at Visé .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 7]: They 've practically admitted it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 6]: `` Where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 10]: `` The man is sitting there against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 7]: The lady is in the barn .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 7]: -- Stand up , prisoner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 6]: Franz snatched away the cloak .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 6]: Dalroy rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 9]: He was smiling at the ruthlessness of Fate .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 23]: He was still smiling when Captain von Halwig , of the Prussian Imperial Guard , flashed an electric torch in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 15]: It was unnecessary , perhaps , to render thus easy the task of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 6]: But what did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 25]: That lynx of a corporal was sure of his ground , and would refuse to be gainsaid even by a staff-officer and a Guardsman .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 13]: Von Halwig 's astonishment seemed to choke back any display of wrath .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: `` Then it is really you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 6]: he said quietly in English .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: The torch was switched off .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 17]: Dalroy 's eyes were momentarily blinded by the glare , but he heard an ugly chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 8]: `` Where is the female prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 16]: said Von Halwig , with a formality that was as perplexing as his subdued manner .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 9]: `` Here , _ Herr Hauptmann _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 6]: The two entered the barn .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 12]: So far as Dalroy could judge , no word was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 15]: The torch flared again , remained lighted a full half-minute , and was extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 15]: Von Halwig reappeared , seemed to ponder matters , and turned to the corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 12]: `` Put the woman in my car , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 17]: `` Fall in your men , and be ready to escort me back to the village .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 12]: You 've done a good day 's work , corporal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 14]: `` Two men have gone in pursuit of Jan Maertz , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 15]: They 'll have sense enough to come on to headquarters if they catch him .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 7]: How is this Englishman secured ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 5]: The jubilant Franz explained .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 9]: `` Mount him on one of your horses .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 11]: The trooper can squeeze in in front of the car .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 11]: Has the female prisoner a dagger or a pistol ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 13]: `` I have not searched her , _ Herr Hauptmann _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 11]: `` Make sure , but offer no violence or discourtesy .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 9]: No , leave this fellow here at present .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 10]: I want a few words with him in private .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 15]: Assemble your men around the car , and take the woman there now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 5]: Irene was led out .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 20]: She paused in the doorway , and the corporal thought she did not know what she was wanted for .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 18]: `` You are to be conveyed in the automobile , _ Fräulein _ , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 10]: But she was looking for Dalroy in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 20]: Before anyone could interfere , she ran and threw her arms around him , kissing him on the lips .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 8]: `` Good-bye , my dear one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 7]: she wailed in a heart-broken way .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 19]: `` We may not meet again on this earth , but I am yours to all eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 16]: `` With these words in my ears I shall die happy , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 20]: Her embrace thrilled him with a strange ecstasy , yet the pain of that parting was worse than death .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 18]: Were ever lovers ' vows plighted in such conditions in the history of this gray old world ?
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 7]: Franz seized the girl 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: She knew it would be undignified to resist .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 22]: Kissing Dalroy again , she whispered a last choking farewell , and suffered her guide to take her where he willed .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 6]: She walked with stumbling feet .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 34]: Her eyes were dimmed with tears ; but , sustained by the pride of her race , she refused to sob , and bit her lower lip in dauntless resolve not to yield .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 10]: The rain was beating down now in heavy gusts .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 23]: Von Halwig , if he had no concern for the comfort of the troopers , had a good deal for his own .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 6]: `` Damn the weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 3]: he grunted .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 6]: `` Come into the bar .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: You can walk , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 22]: He turned on the torch , which was controlled by a sliding button , and saw how the prisoner was secured .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 12]: Then he flashed the light into the interior of the barn .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 40]: It was a ramshackle place at the best , and looked peculiarly forlorn after the rummaging it had undergone since the fight , a recent picket having evidently torn down stalls and mangers to provide materials for a fire .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 29]: Part of a long sloping ladder had been consumed for that purpose , so that an open trap-door in the boarded floor of an upper storey was inaccessible .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 17]: The barn itself was unusually lofty , running to a height of twenty feet or more .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 5]: There were no windows .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 22]: Some rats , tempted out already by the oats spilled from the horses ' nose-bags , scuttled away from the light .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 19]: Through the trap-door the noise of the rain pounding on a shingle roof came with a curious hollowness .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 16]: Von Halwig did not extinguish the lamp , but tucked it under his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 5]: He lighted a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 12]: With each movement of his body the beam of light shifted .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 82]: Now it played on the wall , against which Dalroy leaned , because the cramped state of his arms was already becoming irksome ; now it shone through the doorway , forming a sort of luminous blur in the rain , now it dwelt on the Englishman , standing there in his worn blouse , baggy breeches , and sabots , an old flannel shirt open at the neck , and a month 's growth of beard on cheeks and chin .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 21]: The hat which Irene made fun of had been tilted at a rakish angle when the corporal removed the cloak .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 22]: Certainly he was changed in essentials since he and the Guardsman last met face to face on the platform at Aix-la-Chapelle .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 6]: But the eyes were unalterable .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 22]: They were still resolute , and strangely calm , because he had nerved himself not to flinch before this strutting popinjay .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 14]: `` You wonder why I have brought you in here , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 7]: began Von Halwig , in English .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 13]: `` Perhaps to gloat over me , '' was the quiet reply .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 4]: Is it necessary ?
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 6]: At Aix I was excited .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 5]: The Day had come .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 13]: The Day of which we Germans have dreamed for many a year .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 11]: I am young , but I have already won promotion .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 7]: I belong to an irresistible army .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 5]: War steadies a man .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 42]: But when we reach Oombergen you will be paraded before a crusty old General , and even I , Von Halwig of the staff , and a friend of the Emperor , may not converse with a spy and a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 9]: So we shall have a little chat now .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: What say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 12]: `` It all depends what you wish to talk about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 11]: `` About you and her ladyship , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 14]: `` May I ask whom you mean by ` her ladyship ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 8]: `` Is n't that correct English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 13]: `` It can be , if applied to a lady of title .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 22]: But when used with reference presumably to a young lady who is a governess , it sounds like clumsy sarcasm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 5]: `` Governess the devil !
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 12]: With whom , then , have you been roaming Belgium ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 9]: `` Miss Irene Beresford , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 10]: `` You 're not a fool , Captain Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 13]: Do you honestly tell me you do n't _ know _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 5]: `` Know what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 21]: `` That the girl you brought from Berlin is Lady Irene Beresford , daughter of the Earl of Glastonbury . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 8]: There was a moment of intense silence .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 20]: In some ways it was immaterial to Dalroy what social position had been filled by the woman he loved .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 23]: But , in others , the discovery that Irene was actually the aristocrat she looked was a very vital and serious thing .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 26]: It made clear the meaning of certain references to distinguished people , both in Germany and in England , which had puzzled him at times .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 26]: Transcending all else in importance , it might even safeguard her from German malevolence , since the Teuton pays an absurd homage to mere rank .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 23]: `` I did not know , '' he said , and his voice was not so thoroughly under control as he desired .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 6]: Von Halwig laughed loudly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 3]: _ Almächtig !
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 18]: _ '' he spluttered , `` our smart corporal of hussars seems to have spoiled a romance .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 4]: What a pity !
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 24]: You 'll be shot before midnight , my gallant captain , but the lady will be sent to Berlin with the utmost care .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 19]: Even I , who have an educated taste in the female line , dare n't wink at her .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 14]: Has she never told you why she bolted in such a hurry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 13]: `` Never hinted that a royal prince was wild about her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 10]: `` Well , you have my word for it .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 3]: _ Himmel !
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 6]: _ women are queer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 13]: `` She has suffered much to escape from your royal prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 20]: `` She 'll be returned to him now , slightly soiled , but nearly as good as new . ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 10]: `` I wish my hands were not tied . ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 8]: `` Oh , no heroics , please .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 10]: We have no time for nonsense of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 6]: Is the light irritating you ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 7]: I 'll put it here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 13]: Von Halwig stooped , and placed the torch on the broken ladder .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 18]: Its radiance illumined an oval of the rough , square stones with which the barn was paved .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 8]: Thenceforth , the vivid glare remained stationary .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 19]: The two men , facing each other at a distance of about six feet , were in shadow .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 26]: They could see each other quite well , however , in the dim borrowed light , and the Guardsman flicked the ash from his cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 13]: `` You 're English , I 'm German , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 11]: `` We represent the positive and negative poles of thought .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 18]: If it hurts your feelings that I should speak of Lady Irene , let 's forget her .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 22]: What I really want to ask you is this -- why has England been so mad as to fight Germany ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 42]: CHAPTER XIII THE WOODEN HORSE OF TROY The question struck Dalroy as so bizarre -- in the conditions so ludicrous -- that , despite the cold fury evoked by Von Halwig 's innuendoes with regard to Irene , he nearly laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 16]: `` I am in no mood to discuss international politics , '' he answered curtly .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 16]: The other , who seemed to have his temper well under control , merely nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 18]: Indeed , he was obviously , if unconsciously , modelling his behaviour on that of his prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 25]: `` I only imagined that you might be interested in hearing what 's going to happen to your damned country , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: `` I know already .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 18]: She will emerge from this struggle greater , more renowned , more invincible than ever . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 4]: _ Dummes zeug !
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 4]: _ All rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 20]: That 's your House of Commons and music-hall patter , meant to tickle the ears of the British working-man .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 10]: England is going to be wiped off the map .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 6]: We 're obliterating her now .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 35]: You 've been in Belgium a month , and must have seen things which your stupid John Bulls at home ca n't even comprehend , which they never will comprehend till too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 8]: He paused , awaiting a reply perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 3]: None came .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 32]: `` It 's rough luck that you , a soldier like myself , may not share in the game , even on the losing side , '' went on Von Halwig .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 30]: `` But you would be a particularly dangerous sort of spy if you contrived to reach England , especially with the information I 'm now going to give you .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 9]: You ca n't possibly escape , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 15]: You will be executed , not as a spy , but as a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 9]: You left a rather heavy mark on us .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 36]: Two soldiers in a hut near Visé , three officers and a private in the mill , five soldiers in the wood at Argenteau -- '' `` You flatter me , '' put in Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 18]: `` I may have shot one fellow in the wood , a real spy , named Schwartz .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 5]: But that is all .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: Your men killed one another there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 14]: `` The credit was given to you , '' was the dry retort .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 16]: `` But -- _ es ist mir ganz einerlei _ -- what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 28]: You 're an intelligent Englishman , and that is why I am taking the trouble to tell you exactly why Great Britain will soon be Little Britain .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 11]: Understand , I 'm supplying facts , not war bulletins .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 7]: On land you 're beaten already .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 6]: Our armies are near Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 6]: German cavalry entered Chantilly to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 27]: Your men made a great stand , and fought a four days ' rearguard action which will figure in the text-books for the next fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 13]: But the French are broken , the English Expeditionary Force nearly destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 9]: The French Government has deserted Paris for Bordeaux .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 20]: And , excuse me if I laugh , Lord Kitchener has asked for a hundred thousand more men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 12]: `` He will get five millions if he needs them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 11]: Von Halwig swept the retort aside with an impatient flourish .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 4]: `` Too late !
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 3]: Too late !
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 7]: I 'll prove it to you .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 5]: Turkey is joining us .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 7]: Bulgaria will come in when wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 24]: Greece wo n't lift a finger in the Balkans , and a great army of Turks led by Germans will march on Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 7]: South Africa will rise in rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 21]: Ireland is quiet for the time , but who knows what will happen when she sees England on her knees ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 7]: Italy is sitting on the fence .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 20]: The United States are snivelling , but German influence is too strong out there to permit of active interference .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 25]: And , in any event , what can America do except look on , shivering at the prospect of her own turn coming next ?
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 28]: Russia is making a stir in East Prussia and along the Austrian frontier , so poor Old England is chortling because the Slav is fighting her battles .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 5]: It is to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 11]: We 'll pen the Bear long before he becomes dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 8]: I am not boasting , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 40]: Why should _ I _ , Captain von Halwig of the Imperial Guard , be messing about in a wretched Flemish village when our men are about to storm Paris in the west and tackle Russia in the east ?
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 4]: I 'll explain .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 10]: I 'm here because I know England so well .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 16]: My job is to help in organising the invading force which will gather at Calais .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 7]: that amuses you , does it ?
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 9]: The British fleet is the obstacle , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 3]: Not it .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 11]: Seriously now , do you regard us Germans as idiots ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 9]: No ; I 'm sure you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 5]: You _ know _ .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 10]: These fellows in Parliament _ do n't _ know .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 33]: I assure you , on my honour , our general staff is confident that a German army will land on British soil -- in Britain itself I mean -- before Christmas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 16]: The speaker interrupted this flood of dire prophecy in order to light a fresh cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 31]: Then clasping his hands behind his back , and strutting with feet well apart , he said quite affably , `` Why do n't you put a question or two ?
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 20]: If you believe I 'm reciting a fairy tale , say so , and point out the stupidities . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 19]: Now , Dalroy had not been `` amused '' by the statement that the Germans might occupy Calais .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 16]: He had already discounted even worse reverses as lying well within the bounds of possibility .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 17]: He was certain , too , that the Prussian was saying that which he really believed .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 30]: But his nerves of steel were undoubtedly tried almost beyond endurance at the instant Von Halwig noticed the involuntary movement which elicited that uninvited comment on the British fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 31]: As the word `` Calais '' quitted the Guardsman 's lips , a rope , with a noose at the end , dropped with swift stealth through the open trap-door .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 30]: Its descent was checked when the noose dangled slightly higher than his head , and whoever was manipulating it began at once to swing it slowly forward and backward .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 53]: Von Halwig stood some six or seven feet nearer the wall than the point which the rope would have touched if lowered to the floor , so the objective aimed at by that pendulum action was not difficult to grasp , being nothing else than his speedy and noiseless extinction by hanging .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 31]: It is an oft-repeated though far-fetched assertion that a drowning man reviews the whole of his life during the few seconds which separate the last conscious struggle from complete anæsthesia .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 26]: That may or may not be true , but Dalroy now experienced a brain-storm not lacking many of the essentials of some such mental kinema .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 21]: Think what that swinging rope , with its unseen human agency , meant to a captive in his hapless position !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 15]: It was simply incredible that one man alone would attempt so daring an expedient .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 39]: Not only , then , were a number of plucky and resourceful allies concealed in the loft , but they must have been hidden there before the detachment of Death 's - Head Hussars occupied the barn beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 14]: Therefore , they knew the enemy 's strength , yet were not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 21]: That they were ready-witted was shown by the method evolved for the suppression of that blatant Teuton , Von Halwig .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 51]: It was evident , too , that they had intended to lie _ perdu _ till the cavalry were gone , but had been moved to action by a desire to rescue the bound Englishman who was being twitted so outrageously on his own and his country 's supposed misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 5]: Who could they be ?
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 12]: Were they armed , and sufficiently numerous to rout the Germans ?
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 12]: In any event , how could they deliver an effective attack ?
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 59]: He , Dalroy , took it for granted that the imminent strangulation of the Guardsman , if successful , was but the prelude to a sharp fight , since Von Halwig 's death , though supremely dramatic as an isolated incident , would neither benefit the prisoners nor conduce to the well-being of the people in the loft .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 47]: How , then , did they purpose dealing with a score of trained soldiers , who must already be fidgeting in the rain , and whose leader , the corporal , might look in at any moment to ascertain what was delaying the young staff captain .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 33]: Discipline was all very well , but these hussars belonged to a crack regiment , and their colonel would resent strongly the needless exposure of his men and horses to inclement weather .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 33]: Moreover , how easy it was for the corporal to convey a polite hint to Von Halwig by asking if the chauffeur should not turn the car in readiness for his departure !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 20]: All this , and more , cascaded through Dalroy 's brain while his enemy was lighting the second cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 31]: He was in the plight of a shipwrecked sailor clinging to a sinking craft , who saw a lifeboat approaching , yet dared neither look at nor signal to it .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 16]: He must bend all his energies now to the task of keeping Von Halwig occupied .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 13]: What would happen when the noose coiled around the orator 's neck ?
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 13]: Would it tighten with sufficient rapidity to choke a cry for help ?
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 9]: Would it fall awkwardly , and warn him ?
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 27]: Were any of the troopers so placed that they could see into that section of the barn , and thus witness their officer 's extraordinary predicament ?
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 4]: Who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 26]: How might a man form any sort of opinion as to the yea or nay of a juggler 's feat which savoured of black magic ?
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 15]: Dalroy gave up the effort to guess what the next half-minute might bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 40]: Those mysterious beings up there needed the best help he could offer , and his powers in that respect were strictly limited to two channels -- he must egg on the talker -- he must not watch that rope .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 35]: `` I am ready to admit Germany 's strength on land , '' he said , resolutely fixing his eyes on an iron cross attached to the Prussian 's tunic above the top button .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 7]: `` That is a reasonable claim .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 16]: How futile otherwise would have been your twenty years of preparation for this very war !
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 18]: But my mind is far too dense to understand how you can disregard the English Channel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: `` The _ English _ Channel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 4]: scoffed Von Halwig .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 20]: `` The impudence of you _ verdammt _ -- No , it 's foolish to lose one 's temper .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 6]: Well , I 'll explain .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 16]: The really important part of the _ English _ Channel is about to become German .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 17]: For a little time we leave you the surface , but Germany will own the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 10]: Your navy is about to receive a horrible surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 6]: We 've caught you napping .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 14]: While Britain was ruling the sea we Germans have been experimenting with it .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 29]: Our visible fleet is good , but not good enough , so we allowed your naval superiority to keep you quiet until we had perfected our invisible fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 5]: We are ready now .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 23]: We possess three submarines to your one ; and can build more , and bigger , and better under-sea boats than you .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 7]: Do you realise what that means ?
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 20]: Already we have sunk four of your best cruisers , and they never saw the vessel that destroyed them .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 9]: We are playing havoc with your mercantile marine .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 8]: Britain is girdled with mines and torpedoes .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 34]: No ship can enter or leave any of your ports without incurring the almost unavoidable risk of -- '' A rat scampered across one of the speaker 's feet , and startled him .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 14]: He swore , dropped the cigarette , and lighted another , the third .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 29]: Like every junior officer of the German _ corps d'élite _ , he had sedulously copied the manners and bearing of the commissioned ranks in the British army .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 14]: But your true German is neurotic ; the rat had scratched the veneer .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 24]: Meanwhile the rope rose quickly half-way to the trap-door ; it fell again when Von Halwig donned the prophet 's mantle once more .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 43]: `` We can not only ruin and starve you , '' he said exultantly , `` but we have guns which will beat a way for our troops from Calais to Dover against all the ships you dare mass in those waters .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 8]: We have you bested in every way .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 14]: Each German company takes the field with more machine-guns than a British regiment .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 9]: We have high explosives you never heard of .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 16]: While you were playing polo and golf our chemists were busy in their laboratories . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 12]: His voice rose as he reeled off this litany of war .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 17]: His perfect command of English was not proof against the guttural clank and crash of German .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 18]: He became a veritable German talking English , rather than an accomplished linguist using a foreign tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 15]: Oddly enough , his next tirade showed that he was half-aware of the change .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 13]: `` Old England is done , Captain Dalroy , '' he chanted .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 10]: `` Young Germany is about to take her place .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 11]: The world must learn to speak German , not English .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 13]: Six months from now I 'll begin to forget your makeshift language .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 34]: Six months from now the German Eagle will flaunt in the breeze as securely in London as it flies to-day in Berlin and Brussels , and , it may be , in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 37]: If I 'm lucky , and get through the war -- _ Gott in Himm _ -- '' With a sudden vicious swoop the noose settled on Von Halwig 's shoulders , and was jerked taut .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 6]: A master-hand made that cast .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 15]: No American cowboy ever placed lasso more neatly on the horns of unruly steer .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 38]: At one instant the rope was swinging back and forth noiselessly ; at the next , rising under the impetus of a gentle flick , it whirled over the Prussian 's head and tightened around his neck .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 30]: He tore madly at it with both hands , but was already lifted off his feet , and in process of being hauled upward with an almost incredible rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 36]: There was a momentary delay when his head reached the level of the trap-door ; but Dalroy distinctly saw two hands grasp the struggling arms and heave the Guardsman 's long body out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 19]: An astounding feature of this tragic episode was the absence of any outcry on the victim 's part .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 16]: He uttered no sound other than a stifled gurgle after that half-completed exclamation was stilled .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 32]: Possibly , his dazed wits concentrated on the one frantic endeavour -- to get rid of that horrible choking thing which had clutched at him from out of the surrounding obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 38]: And now a thick knotted rope plumped down until its end lay on the floor , and a rough-looking fellow , clothed like Maertz or Dalroy himself , descended with the ease and agility of a monkey .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 55]: He was just the kind of shaggy goblin one might expect to emerge from any such hiding-place ; but he carried a slung rifle , and the bewildered prisoner , taking a few steps forward to greet his rescuer , realised that the weapon was a Lee-Enfield of the latest British army pattern . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 19]: ` Arf a mo ' , sir , '' gurgled the new-comer in a husky and cheerful whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 19]: `` I 'll ` old the rope till the next of ahr little knot ` as shinned dahn .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 17]: Then I 'll cut yer loose , an ' we 'll get the wind up ahtside .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 12]: Didjever ` ear such a gas-bag as that bloomin ' Jarman ?
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 14]: Lord luv ' a duck , ' e could n't ` arf tork !
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 30]: But Shiney Black , one of ahrs , ` as just shoved a bynit through ` is gizzard , so _ that _ cock wo n't crow agine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 11]: Dalroy owned only a reader 's knowledge of colloquial cockney .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 43]: He inferred , rather than actually understood , that several British soldiers were secreted in the loft , and that one of them , named `` Shiney Black , '' had closed Von Halwig 's career in the twinkling of an eye .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 10]: By this time another man had reached the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 13]: He seized the rope and steadied it , and a third appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 33]: The first gnome whipped out a knife , freed Dalroy , unslung his rifle , and picked up the electric torch , which he held so that its beam filled the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 6]: Man after man came down .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 35]: Each was armed with a regulation rifle ; Dalroy , for once thrown completely off his balance , became dimly aware that in every instance the equipment included bayonet , bandolier , and haversack .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 20]: The cohort formed up , too , as though they had rehearsed the procedure in the gymnasium at Aldershot .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 9]: There was no muttered order , no uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 14]: Rifles were unslung , bayonets fixed , and safety catches turned over soundlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 25]: Conquering his blank amazement as best he could , Dalroy inquired of the first sprite how many the party consisted of , all told .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 17]: `` Twelve an ' the corp ` ral , sir , '' came the prompt answer .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 8]: `` The lucky thirteen we calls ahrselves .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 24]: An ' we wanted a bit o ' luck ter leg it all the w ' y from Monze to this ` ole .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 37]: Not that we ` ad n't ter kill any Gord 's quantity o ' Yewlans when they troied ter be funny , an ' stop us -- Here 's the corp ` ral , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 23]: Dalroy was confronted by a clear-eyed man , whose square-shouldered erectness was not concealed by the unkempt clothes of a Belgian peasant .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 32]: Carrying the rifle at `` the slope , '' and bringing his right hand smartly across to the small of the butt , the leader of this lost legion announced himself .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 15]: `` Corporal Bates , sir , A Company , 2nd Battalion of the Buffs .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: That German officer made out , sir , that you were in our army . ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 15]: `` Yes , I am Captain Dalroy , of the 2nd Bengal Lancers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 11]: Corporal Bates became , if possible , even more clear-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 9]: `` Stationed where last year , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 10]: `` At Lucknow , with your own battalion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 28]: `` Well , I 'm -- beg pardon , sir , but are you the Lieutenant Dalroy who rode the winner of the Civil Service Cup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 11]: `` Yes , the Maharajah of Chutneypore 's Diwan . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 4]: `` Good enough !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: You understand , sir , I _ had _ to ask .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 8]: Will you take command , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 6]: `` No indeed , corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 6]: I shall only humbly advise .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 8]: But we must rescue the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 11]: `` I heard and saw all that passed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 5]: The Germans are mounted .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 7]: The lady 's in the car .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 10]: We were watching through a hole in the roof .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 18]: The last man remained there so as to warn us if any of 'em came this way .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 21]: As you know their lingo , sir , I recommend that when we creep out you tell 'em to dismount .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 8]: They 'll do it like a shot .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: Then we 'll rush 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 7]: Here 's the officer 's pistol .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 17]: _ You _ might take care of the shuffer and the chap by his side . ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 5]: `` Excellent , corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 4]: Just one suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 18]: Let half of your men steal round to the rear , whether or not the troopers dismount .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 20]: They should be headed off from Oombergen , the village near here , where they have two squadrons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 5]: `` Right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 17]: -- Smithy , take the left half-section , and cut off the retreat on the left .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 5]: -- Ready , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 6]: -- Douse that glim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 5]: Out went the torch .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: Fourteen shadows flitted forth into the darkness and rain .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 22]: The car , with its staring head-lights , was drawn up about thirty yards away , and somewhat to the left .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 20]: On both sides and in rear were grouped the hussars , men and horses looming up in spectral shapes .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 21]: The raindrops shone like tiny shafts of polished steel in the two cones of radiance cast by the acetylene lamps .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 23]: Dalroy , miraculously become a soldier again , saw instantly that the troopers were cloaked , and their carbines in the buckets .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 21]: He waited a few seconds while `` Smithy '' and his band crept swiftly along the wall of the barn .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 29]: Then , copying to the best of his ability the shrill yell of a German officer giving a command , he shouted , `` Squad -- dismount ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 9]: He was obeyed with a clatter of accoutrements .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 4]: He ran forward .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 31]: Not knowing the `` system '' perfected by the `` lucky thirteen , '' he looked for an irregular volley at close range , throwing the hussars into inextricable confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 25]: But not a rifle was fired until some seconds after he himself had shot and killed or seriously wounded the chauffeur and the escort .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 12]: For all that , thirteen hussars were already out of action .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 26]: The men who had crossed Belgium from Mons had learnt to depend on the bayonet , which never missed , and was silent and efficacious .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 11]: The affair seemed to end ere it had well begun .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 33]: Only two troopers succeeded in mounting their plunging horses , and they , finding the road to Oombergen barred , tried to bolt westward , whereupon they were bowled over like rabbits .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 17]: Their terrified chargers , after scampering wildly a few paces , trotted back to the others .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 8]: Not one of the twenty got away .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 25]: Hampered by their heavy cloaks , and taken completely by surprise , the hussars offered hardly any resistance , but fell cursing and howling .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 20]: As for the pair seated in front of the car , they never knew why or how death came .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 12]: `` Now , then , Smithy , show a light ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 4]: shouted Corporal Bates .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 6]: there you are , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 11]: I meant to make sure of _ this _ chap .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 7]: I got him straight off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 22]: The torch revealed Corporal Franz stretched on his back , and frothing blood , Bates 's bayonet having pierced his lungs .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 18]: It were better for the shrewd Berliner if his wits had been duller and his mind cleaner .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 20]: Not soldierly zeal but a gross animalism led him in the first instance to make a really important arrest .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 34]: His ghoulish intent was requited now in full measure , and the life wheezed out of him speedily as he lay there quivering in the gloom and mire of that rain-swept woodland road .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 20]: Seldom , even when successfully ambushed , has any small detachment of troops been destroyed so quickly and thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 8]: This killing was almost an artistic triumph .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: `` Fall in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 3]: growled Bates .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 5]: `` Any casualties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: `` If there is , the blighters oughter be court-mawshalled , '' chirped Smith .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 26]: A momentary shuffling of grotesque forms , and a deep voice boomed , `` Half-time score -- England twenty , Germany _ nil _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 25]: `` Left section -- look 'em over , and carry any wounded men likely to live into the barn , '' said the corporal .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 9]: `` Give 'em first aid an ' water-bottles .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 4]: Step lively too !
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 8]: Right section -- hold the horses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 32]: This leader and his men were as skilled in the business of slaying an enemy as Robin Hood and his band of poachers in the taking of the king 's venison .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 9]: Dalroy knew they needed no guidance from him .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 8]: He opened the door of the car .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 4]: `` Irene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 14]: She was sitting there , a forlorn figure huddled up in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 5]: The windows were closed .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 26]: Each sheet of glass was so blurred by the swirling rain that she could not possibly make out the actual cause of the external hubbub .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 21]: After the hard schooling of the past month she realised , of course , that a rescue was being attempted .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 14]: Naturally , too , she put it down to the escape of Maertz .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 45]: Although her heart was thrumming wildly , her soul on fire with a hope almost dangerous in its frenzy , she resolved not to stir from her prison until the one man she longed to see again in this world came to free her .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 20]: Yet when she heard his voice the tension snapped so suddenly that there was peril in the other extreme .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 22]: She sat so still that Dalroy said a second time , with a curious sharpness of tone , `` Irene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 12]: `` Yes , dear , '' she contrived to murmur hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 6]: `` It 's all over .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 10]: A squad of British soldiers dropped from the skies .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 13]: Every German is laid out , Von Halwig with the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 4]: `` Von Halwig !
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 5]: Is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 5]: `` I am glad .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 9]: Arthur , they have not wounded you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 6]: `` Not a scratch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: `` And Maertz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 7]: `` We must see to him .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 5]: Will you come out ?
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: Never mind the rain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 4]: `` The rain !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 22]: Ah , dear God , that I should feel the blessed rain beating on my face once more in liberty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 21]: She gave him her hand , and they stood for a moment , peering deep into each other 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 28]: `` Arthur , '' she said , so quietly now that the storm seemed to have passed from her spirit , `` you have work to do .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 6]: I shall not keep you .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 13]: Tell me where to wait , and there you shall find me .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 11]: But , before you go , promise me one thing .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 20]: If we fall again into the hands of the Germans , shoot me before I become their prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 13]: `` No need to talk of that , '' he soothed her .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 7]: `` We have a splendid escort .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 12]: In two hours -- '' She caught him by both shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 12]: `` You _ must _ promise , '' she cried vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 11]: He was startled by the vibrant passion in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 29]: He began then to understand the real horrors of Irene 's vigil , whether in the rat-infested darkness of the barn or the cushioned luxury of the limousine .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' he muttered savagely , `` I promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 34]: Taking her by the arm , he led her to the front of the car , where , clearly visible herself , she would see little if aught of the shambles in rear .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 5]: Corporal Bates hurried up .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 9]: `` Her ladyship all right , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 4]: he inquired briskly .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' replied Dalroy , conscious of a slight tremulousness in the arm he was holding .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 27]: Corporal Bates , though in all probability he had never even heard of Bacon 's somewhat trite aphorism , was essentially an `` exact '' man .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: He never erred as to distinctions of rank or title .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 9]: His salute was the pride of the Buffs .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 35]: Blithely regardless of the fact that not more than five minutes earlier Captain Dalroy had confessed himself ignorant of Lady Irene Beresford 's actual social status , he alluded to her `` correctly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 19]: `` I think , sir , '' he rattled on , `` that we ought to be moving .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 16]: It 's quite dark now , an ' we have our route marked out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 11]: `` We 've been directed by a priest , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 9]: The Belgian priests have done us a treat .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 10]: In every village they showed us the safest roads .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 18]: Even when they could n't make us understand their lingo they could always pencil a map . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 9]: Do you follow the road to Oosterzeele ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 8]: `` For about a mile , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 21]: Then we branch off into a lane leading west to the river Schelde , which we cross by a ferry .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 14]: Once past that ferry , an ' there 's no more Germans . ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 9]: Have you searched the enemy for papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 12]: We 're stuffed with note-books an ' other little souveeners . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 7]: `` Do your men ride ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 19]: `` Some of 'em , sir , but they 'll foot it , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 12]: They hate killing horses , so we turn 'em loose generally .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 8]: This lot should be tied up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 7]: `` What of the car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 13]: `` Smithy will attend to that with a bomb , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 25]: Bates evidently knew his business , so evidently that Dalroy did not even question him as to the true inwardness of Smithy 's attentions .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 11]: The squad cleared up their tasks with an extraordinary celerity .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 18]: Smithy crawled under the automobile with the flashlight , remained there exactly thirty seconds , and reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 4]: The corporal saluted .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 12]: `` We 're ready now , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 14]: `` Perhaps her ladyship will march with you behind the centre file ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: `` Do you head the column ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 13]: `` Then , for a little way , we 'll accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 9]: There were three in our party , corporal .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 17]: One , a Belgian named Jan Maertz , risked death to get away and bring help .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 19]: I 'm afraid he has been captured on the Oosterzeele road by two hussars detailed for the job .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 13]: So , you see , I must try and save him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 38]: CHAPTER XIV THE MARNE -- AND AFTER `` That 's awkward , sir , '' said the corporal , as the detachment moved off into the night , leaving the motor-car 's acetylene lamps still blazing merrily .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 7]: `` Why ` awkward ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 3]: demanded Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 58]: `` Because , when we fellows met in a wood near Monze , we agreed that we 'd stick together , and fight to a finish ; but if any man strayed by accident , or got hit so badly that he could n't march , he took his chances , and the rest went on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 4]: `` Quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 9]: How does that affect the present situation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 22]: `` Well , sir , '' said Bates , after a pause , `` there 's you an ' the lady .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 11]: Our chaps are interested , if I may say it .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 44]: You ought to have heard their langwidge , even in whispers , when that -- well , I ca n't call him anything much worse than what he was , a German officer -- when he was telling you off , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 11]: `` What did the German officer say , sergeant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 5]: put in Irene innocently .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 6]: `` Corporal , your ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 9]: Corporal Bates , of the 2nd Buffs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 13]: `` I 'm sorry to have to interrupt , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 13]: `` You must give Lady Irene a full account some other time .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 17]: If you are planning to cross the Schelde to-night there is a long march before you .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 10]: We part company at the lane you spoke of .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 17]: I leave her ladyship in the care of you and your men with the greatest confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 5]: I make for Oosterzeele .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 19]: If Jan Maertz is a prisoner , I must do what lies in my power to rescue him .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 17]: If I fail , I 'll follow on and report at Gand in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 7]: For a little while none spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 41]: The other men marched in silence , a safeguard which they had made a rigid rule while piercing their way by night through an unknown country held by an enemy who would not have given quarter to any English soldier .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 8]: Bates was really a very sharp fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 13]: He had sense enough to know that he had said enough already .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 32]: Dalroy 's use of Irene 's title conveyed a hint of complications rather beyond the ken of one whose acquaintance with the facts was limited to an overheard conversation between strangers .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 43]: Moreover , soldier that he was , the corporal realised that one of his own officers was not only deliberately risking his life in order to save that of a Belgian peasant , but felt in honour bound to do no less .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 11]: So Irene was left to tread the narrow path unaided .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 11]: To her lasting credit , she neither flinched nor faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 26]: `` We may find it difficult to reach Gand , so I 'll wait for you in Ostend , Arthur , '' she said composedly .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 46]: Now , these two young people had just been snatched from death , or worse , in a manner which , a few weeks earlier , the least critical reader of romantic fiction would have denounced as so wildly improbable that imagination boggled at it .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 34]: Irene , too , had unmistakably told the man who had never uttered a word of the love that was consuming him that neither rank nor wealth could interpose any barrier between them .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 25]: It was hard , almost unbearable , that they should be parted in the very hour when freedom might truly come with the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 13]: Dalroy trudged a good twenty paces before he dared trust his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 24]: Even then , he blurted out , not the measured agreement which his brain dictated , but a prayer from his very heart .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 11]: `` May God bless and guard you , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 17]: was what he said , and Irene 's response was choked by a pitiful little sob .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 26]: Suddenly Dalroy , whose hearing was quickened by the training of Indian _ shikar _ , touched the corporal 's arm , and stood fast .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 30]: Bates gave a peculiar click in his throat , and the squad halted , each man 's feet remaining in whatever position they happened to be at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 10]: `` Horses coming this way , '' breathed Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 5]: `` Right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 16]: This 'll be your two , with Jan wot 's - his-name , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 7]: Leave them to us , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 11]: -- Smithy , Macdonald , and Shiner -- forward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 10]: Three shapes materialised close to the trio in front .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 33]: The rain was still pelting down , and the trees nearly met overhead , so the road was discernible only by a strip of skyline , itself merely a less dense blackness .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 16]: `` Them two Yewlans , '' explained the corporal , `` probably bringing a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: Mind you do n't hurt him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 9]: No more explicit instructions were given or needed .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 9]: Of such material were the First Hundred Thousand .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 15]: `` Take her ladyship back a few yards , sir , '' gurgled Bates .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 6]: `` The horses may bolt .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 14]: If they do we must stop 'em before they gallop over us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 13]: Every other consideration was banished instantly by the thrill of approaching combat .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 25]: By this time , Dalroy was steeped in admiration for his escort 's methods , and he awaited developments now with keen professional curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 12]: And this is what he saw , after a breathless interval .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 16]: A flash in the gloom , and the vague silhouettes of two hussars on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 8]: One horse reared , the other swerved .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 5]: One man never spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 13]: The other rapped out an oath which merged into a frantic squeal .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 27]: By an odd trick of memory , Dalroy recalled old Joos 's description of the death of Busch : `` He squealed like a pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 11]: Then came a cockney voice , `` Cheer-o , mitey !
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 6]: We 're friends , ammies !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 18]: Damn it all , you ai n't tikin ' us for Boshes , are yer ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 3]: _ Hola !
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 5]: _ Jan Maertz ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 4]: shouted Dalroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 3]: _ Monsieur !
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 18]: _ '' Irene laughed -- yes , laughed , though two men had died before her eyes !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: -- at the amazement conveyed by the Walloon 's gruff yelp .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 6]: `` Do n't be alarmed !
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 12]: These are friends , British soldiers , '' went on Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 15]: `` I thought they were devils from hell , '' was the candid answer .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 5]: Jan was unquestionably frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 38]: For one thing , his hands were tied behind his back , and he was being led by a halter fashioned out of a heel-rope , a plight in which the Chevalier Bayard himself might have quaked .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 69]: For another , he had been plodding along at the side of one of the horses , thinking bitterly of the fair Léontine , whose buxom waist he would never squeeze again , when a beam of dazzling light revealed a crouching , nondescript being which flung itself upward in a panther-like spring , and buried a bayonet to the socket in the body of the nearest trooper .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 6]: No wonder Jan was scared .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 7]: The soldiers had caught both horses .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 16]: Dalroy , a cavalryman , had abandoned the earlier remounts with a twinge of regret .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 39]: He thought now there was no reason why he and Irene should not ride , as the day 's tramp , not to speak of the strain of the past hour , might prove a drawback before morning .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 9]: `` Can you sit a horse astride ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 4]: he asked her .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 10]: `` I prefer it , '' she said promptly .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 13]: Bates offered no objection , as long as they followed in rear .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 15]: The hussar 's cloaks came in useful , and Dalroy buckled on a sword-belt .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 22]: Jan announced that he was good for another twenty miles provided he could win clear of those _ sales Alboches _ .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 32]: He was eager to relate his adventures , but Dalroy quieted him by the downright statement that if his tongue wagged he might soon be either a prisoner again or dead .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 11]: A night so rife with hazard could hardly close tamely .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 46]: The rain cleared off , and the stars came out ere they reached the ferry on the Schelde , and a scout sent ahead came back with the disquieting news that a strong cavalry picket , evidently on the alert , held the right bank .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 16]: But the thirteen had made a specialty of disposing of German pickets in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 51]: In those early days of the war , and particularly in Flanders , Teuton nerves were notoriously jumpy , so the little band crept forward resolutely , dodging from tree to tree , and into and out of ditches , until they could see the stars reflected in the river .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 23]: Dalroy and Irene had dismounted at the first tidings of the enemy , turning a pair of contented horses into a meadow .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 16]: They and Maertz , of course , had to keep well behind the main body .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 18]: The troopers , veritable Uhlans this time , had posted neither sentry nor vedette in the lane .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 9]: Behind them , they thought , lay Germany .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 34]: In front , across the river , the small army of Belgium held the last strip of Belgian territory , which then ran in an irregular line from Antwerp through Gand to Nieuport .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 51]: So the picket watched the black smudge of the opposite bank , and talked of the Kron-Prinz 's stalwarts hacking their way into Paris , and never dreamed of being assailed from the rear , until a number of sturdy demons pounced on them , and did some pretty bayonet-work .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 5]: Fight there was none .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 10]: Those Uhlans able to run ran for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 33]: One fellow , who happened to be mounted , clapped spurs to his charger , and would have got away had not Dalroy delivered a most satisfactory lunge with the hussar sabre .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 15]: No sooner had Bates collected and counted sixteen people than the tactics were changed .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 12]: Five rounds rapid rattled up the road and along the banks .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 27]: `` I find that a bit of noise always helps after we get the windup with the bayonet , sir , '' he explained to Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 20]: `` If any of 'em think of stopping they move on again when they hear a hefty row . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 37]: A Belgian picket , guarding the ferry , and , what was of vast importance to the fugitives , the ferry-boat , wondered , no doubt , what was causing such a commotion among the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 14]: Luckily , the officer in charge recognised a new ring in the rifles .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 20]: He could not identify it , but was certain it came from neither a Belgian nor a German weapon .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 32]: Thus , in a sense , he was prepared for Jan Maertz 's hail , and was even more reassured by Irene 's clear voice urging him to send the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 6]: Two volunteers manned the oars .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 20]: In a couple of minutes the unwieldy craft bumped into a pontoon , and was soon crowded with passengers .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 36]: Never was sweeter music in the ears of a little company of Britons than the placid lap of the current , followed by the sharp challenge of a sentry : '' _ Qui va là ?
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 21]: _ '' `` A party of English soldiers , a Belgian , and an English lady , '' answered Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 5]: An officer hurried forward .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 25]: He dared not use a light , and , in the semi-obscurity of the river bank , found himself confronted by a sinister-looking crew .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 14]: He was cautious , and exceedingly sceptical when told briefly the exact truth .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 36]: His demand that all arms and ammunition should be surrendered before he would agree to send them under escort to the village of Aspen was met by a blank refusal from Bates and his myrmidons .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 46]: Dalroy toned down this cartel into a graceful plea that thirteen soldiers , belonging to eight different regiments of the British army , ought not to be disarmed by their gallant Belgian allies , after having fought all the way from Mons to the Schelde .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 15]: Irene joined in , but Jan Maertz 's rugged speech probably carried greater conviction .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 32]: After a prolonged argument , which the infuriated Germans might easily have interrupted by close-range volleys , the difficulty was adjusted by the unfixing of bayonets and the slinging of rifles .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 15]: A strong guard took them to Aspen , where they arrived about eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 20]: They were marshalled in the kitchen of a comfortable inn , and interviewed by a colonel and a major .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 46]: Oddly enough , Corporal Bates was the first to gain credence by producing his map , and describing the villages he and his mates had passed through , the woods in which they hid for days together , and the curés who had helped them .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 9]: Bates 's story was an epic in itself .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 38]: His men crowded around , and grinned approvingly when he rounded off each curt account of a `` scrap '' by saying , `` Then the Yewlans did a bunk , an ' we pushed on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 55]: Dalroy , acting as interpreter , happened to glance at the circle of cheerful faces during a burst of merriment aroused by a reference to Smithy 's ingenuity in stealing a box of hand grenades from an ammunition wagon , and destroying a General 's motor-car by fixing an infernal machine in the gear-box .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 14]: The mere cranking-up of the engine , it appeared , exploded the detonator .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 15]: `` Is that what you were doing under the car outside the barn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 8]: he inquired , catching Smithy 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 24]: I 've on ' y one left aht o ' six , '' said Smithy , producing an ominous-looking object from a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 8]: `` Is the detonator in position ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 6]: `` Yus , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 17]: `` Will you kindly take it out , and lay it gently on the table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 7]: Smithy obeyed , with reassuring deftness .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 36]: Dalroy was about to comment on the phenomenal risk of carrying such a destructive bomb so carelessly when he happened to notice the roll collar of a khaki tunic beneath Smithy 's blue linen blouse .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 11]: `` Have you still retained part of your uniform ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 7]: `` Oh , yus , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 43]: We all ` ave. We were n't goin ' to strip fer fear of any bally Germans -- beg pawdon , miss -- an ' if it kime to a reel show-dahn we meant ter see it through in reggelation kit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 54]: Every man of twelve had retained his tunic , trousers , and puttees , which were completely covered by the loose-fitting garments supplied by the priest of a hamlet near Louvignies , who concealed them in a loft during four days until the mass of German troops had surged over the French frontier .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 11]: The thirteenth , a Highlander , actually wore his kilt !
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 6]: The Belgian officers grew enthused .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 23]: They insisted on providing a _ vin d'honneur _ , which Irene escaped by pleading utter fatigue , and retiring to rest .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 13]: Dalroy opened his eyes next morning on a bright and sunlit world .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 19]: It might reasonably be expected that his thoughts would dwell on the astounding incidents of the past month .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 7]: They did nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 38]: He tumbled out of a comfortable bed , interviewed the proprietor of the '' _ Trois Couronnes _ , '' and asked that worthy man if he understood the significance of a Bank of England five-pound note .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 28]: During his many and varied ` scapes , Dalroy 's store of money , carried in an inner pocket of his waistcoat , had never been touched .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 14]: _ Monsieur le Patron _ knew all that was necessary about five-pound notes .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 43]: Very quickly a serviceable cloth suit , a pair of boots , some clean linen , a tin bath , and a razor were staged in the bedroom , while the proprietor 's wife was instructed to attend to mademoiselle 's requirements .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 21]: Dalroy was shaving , for the first time in thirty-three days , when voices reached him through the open window .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 3]: He listened .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 27]: Smithy had cornered Shiney Black in the hotel yard , and , in his own phrase , was puttin ' ` im through the ` oop .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 35]: `` You do n't know it , Shiney , but you 're reely a verdamd Henglishman , '' he said , with an accurate reproduction of Von Halwig 's manner if not his accent .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 24]: `` The grite German nytion is abart ter roll yer in the mud , an ' wipe its big feet on yer tummy .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 21]: You 've awsked fer it long enough , an ' nah yer goin ' ter git it in the neck .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 5]: Blood an ' sausage !
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 31]: The cheek o ' a silly little josser like you tellin ' the Lord - ` Igh-Cock-a-doodle-doo that ' e ca n't boss everybody as ' e dam well likes !
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 7]: Shiney , you 're done in !
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 13]: The Keyser sez so , an ' ' e ought ter know .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 4]: W ` y ?
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 6]: That shows yer miserable hignorance !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 36]: The Keyser sez so , I tell yer , so none o ' yer lip , or I , Von Schmit , o ' the Dirty ` Alf-Hundredth , will biff you on the boko .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 8]: I must keep me ` air on .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 34]: As you an ' hevery hother verdamd Henglishman will be snuffed aht before closin ' - time , I shall grashiously tell thee wot 's wot an ' ` oo 's ` oo .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 62]: Germany , the friend o ' peace -- no , you blighter , not Chawlie Peace , the burglar , but the lydy in a nightie , wiv a dove in one ` and an ' a holive-branch in the other -- Germany will wide knee-deep in Belgian an ' French ber-lud so as to ` and you the double Nelson .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 23]: By land an ' sea an ' pawcels post she 'll rine fire an ' brimstone on your pore thick ` ead .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 14]: What ` ave _ you _ done , you 'd like ter know ?
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 9]: Wot _ ` ave n't _ you done ?
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 5]: Are n't you alive ?
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 13]: Wot crime can ekal that when the Keyser said , ` Puff !
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 5]: aht -- tallow-candle ! '
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 12]: _ Ach _ , pig-dorg , I shpit on yer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 23]: `` You go an ' wash yer fice once more , Smithy , '' said Shiney , forcing a word in edgeways .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 11]: `` It 'll improve your looks , per ` aps .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 4]: I dunno . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 15]: `` That 's done it , '' yelped Smithy , warming to his theme .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 23]: `` That 's just yer narsty , scoffin ' British w ' y o ' speakin ' to quiet , respectable Germans .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 7]: That 's wot gets us mad .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 8]: I 'm surprised at yer , Shiney !
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 8]: Yer hattitude brings tears to me heyes .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 24]: Time an ' agine you 've ` eard ahr bee-utiful langwidge -- '' `` I ` ave , indeed , '' interrupted Shiney .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 12]: `` But none o ' it ` ere , me lad .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 14]: There 's a reel born lydy in one o ' them bedrooms . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 21]: `` I 'm not torkin ' o ' the kind of tosh _ you _ hunderstand , '' retorted Smithy .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 15]: `` I 'm alludin ' to the sweet-sahndin ' langwidge o ' our conquerors .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 15]: You 've ` eard it hoffen enuf from the sorft mowves o ' Yewlans .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 24]: On ' y larst night you ` eard it spoke by that stawr hactor , Von ` Allwig , of the Potsdam Busters .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 26]: Yet you can git nothink orf yer chest but a low-dahn cockney wheeze w ` en a benefactor 's givin ' yer the strite tip .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 3]: Pore Shiney !
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 32]: Ye think yer goin ' back to Hengland , ` ome , an ' beauty -- to the barrick-square , bully-beef an ' booze , an ' plenty o ' it .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 4]: Dontcher believe it !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 15]: Wot you 're in fer is a dose o ' German _ Kultur _ .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 72]: W'en yer ship 's been torpedoed fourteen times between Hostend an ' Dover , w ` en yer sarth-eastern trine ` as bumped inter a biker 's dozen o ' different sorts o ' mines , w ` en you 're Zepped the minnit you crorse the Strend to the nearest pub , you 'll begin ter twig wot the Hemperor of All the ` Uns is ackshally a-doin ' of .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 9]: It 's hall hup wiv yer , Shiney !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 15]: You 've ether got ter lie dahn an ' doi , er learn German .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 10]: Nah , w ` ich is it ter be ?
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 15]: Go west wiv yer benighted country , or go nap on the Keyser ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 13]: `` Torkin ' o ' pubs reminds me , '' yawned Shiney .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 16]: `` I could n't get any forrarder on that ginger-pop the Belgian horficers gev us .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 14]: In one o ' them Yewlans ' pawket-books there was five French quid .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 9]: Wot abart a bottle o ' beer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 6]: `` What abart it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 4]: agreed Smithy instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 50]: The soap was drying on Dalroy 's face , but he thrust his head out of the window to look at two of Britain 's first line swaggering through the gateway of the inn , and whistling , `` It 's a long , long way to Tipperary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 25]: Smith and Shiney were true types of the somewhat cynical but ever ready-witted and laughter-loving Londoner , who makes such a first-rate fighting man .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 11]: They were just a couple of ordinary `` Tommies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 49]: The deadly fury of Mons , the daily and nightly peril of the march through a land stricken by a brutal enemy , the score of little battles which they had conducted with an amazing skill and hardihood -- these phases of immortality troubled them not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 82]: An eye-rolling and sabre-rattling emperor might rock the social foundations of half the world , his braggart henchmen destroy that which they could never rebuild , his frantic gang of poets and professors indite Hymns of Hate and blasphemous catch-words like `` Gott strafe England '' ; but the Smithies and Shinies of the British army would never fail to cock a humorous eye at the vapourers , and say sarcastically , `` Well , an ' wot abart it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 28]: * * * * * Somehow , on 7th September 1914 , there was a hitch in the naval programme devised by the _ Deutscher Marineamt _ .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 30]: The Belgian packet-boat , _ Princess Clementine _ , steamed from Ostend to Dover through a smiling sea unvexed by Krupp or any other form of _ Kultur _ .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 22]: Warships , big and little , were there in squadrons ; but gaunt super-Dreadnought and perky destroyer alike was aggressively British .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 8]: England , too , looked strangely unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 58]: There had been sad scenes on the quay at the Belgian port , but a policeman on duty at the shore end of the gangway at Dover seemed to indicate by a majestic calm that any person causing an uproar would be given the alternative of paying ten shillings and costs or `` doing '' seven days .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 31]: The boat was crowded with refugees ; but Dalroy , knowing the wiliness of stewards , had experienced slight difficulty in securing two chairs already loaded with portmanteaus and wraps .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 17]: He heard then , for the first time , why Irene fled so precipitately from Berlin .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 31]: She was a guest in the house of a Minister of State , and one of the Hohenzollern princelings came there to luncheon on that fateful Monday , 3rd August .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 36]: He had invited himself , though he must have been aware that his presence was an insult and an annoyance to the English girl , whom he had pestered with his attentions many times already .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 11]: He was excited , drank heavily , and talked much .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 38]: Irene had arranged to travel home next day , but the wholly unforeseen and swift developments in international affairs , no less than the thinly-veiled threats of a royal admirer , alarmed her into an immediate departure .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 47]: At the twelfth hour she found that her host , father of two girls of her own age -- the school friends , in fact , to whom she was returning a visit -- was actually in league with her persecutor to keep her in Berlin .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 20]: She ran in panic , her one thought being to join her sister in Brussels , and reach home .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 55]: `` So you see , dear , '' she said , with one of those delightfully shy glances which Dalroy loved to provoke , `` I was quite as much sought after as you , and I would certainly have been stopped on the Dutch frontier had I travelled by any other train . ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 11]: The two were packed into a carriage filled to excess .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 36]: They had no luggage other than a small parcel apiece , containing certain articles of clothing which might fetch sixpence in a rag-shop , but were of great and lasting value to the present owners .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 24]: At Charing Cross , while they were walking side by side down the platform , Irene shrieked , `` There they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 35]: She darted forward and flung herself into the arms of two elderly people , a brother in khaki , with the badges of a Guard regiment , and a sister of the flapper order .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 34]: Dalroy had been told at Dover to report at once to the War Office , as he carried much valuable information in his head and Von Halwig 's well-filled note-book in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 10]: He hung back while the embracing was in progress .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 8]: Then Irene introduced him to her family .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 14]: `` You 'll dine with us , Arthur , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 17]: `` I 'll not tell them a word of our adventures till you are present . ''
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 35]: `` You could have heard a pin drop , '' was the excited comment of the flapper sister when endeavouring subsequently to thrill another girl with the sensation created by Irene 's quiet words .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 16]: Literally , this trope was not accurate , because the station was noisier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 8]: Figuratively , it met the case exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 31]: Lady Glastonbury , a gray-haired woman with wise eyes , promptly emulated the action of the British army during the retreat from Mons , and `` saved the situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 21]: `` Of course you 'll stay with us , too , Captain Dalroy , '' she said with pleasant insistence .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 17]: `` Like Irene , you must have lost everything , and need time to refit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 29]: Dalroy murmured some platitude , lifted his hat , and only regained his composure after two narrow escapes from being run over by taxis while crossing Northumberland Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 19]: A newsboy tore past , shouting in the vernacular , `` Great Stand by Sir John French . ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: Dalroy was reminded of Smithy , and Shiney , and Corporal Bates .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 14]: He saw again Jan Maertz waving a farewell from the quai at Ostend .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 21]: He wondered how old Joos was faring , and Léontine , and Monsieur Pochard , and the curé of Verviers .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 5]: Another boy scampered by .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 6]: He carried a contents bill .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 17]: Heavy black type announced that the British were `` holding '' Von Kluck on the Marne .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 5]: Dalroy 's eyes kindled .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 9]: _ His _ work lay _ there _ .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 14]: When the soldier 's task was ended he would come back to Irene .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 7]: CHAPTER XV `` CARRY ON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 24]: After a few delightful days in London , Dalroy walked down Whitehall one fine morning to call at the War Office for orders .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 5]: Irene went with him .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 24]: He expected to be packed off to France that very evening , so the two meant making the utmost of the fast-speeding hours .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 22]: The Intelligence Department had assimilated all the information Dalroy could give , had found it good , and had complimented him .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 49]: As a Bengal Lancer , whose regiment was presumably in India , he would probably be attached to some cavalry unit of the Expeditionary Force ; from being an hunted outlaw , with a price on his head , he would be quietly absorbed by the military machine .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 41]: Very smart he looked in his khaki and brown leather ; Irene , who one short week earlier deemed _ sabots en cuir _ the height of luxury , was dressed _ de rigueur _ for luncheon at the Savoy .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 23]: Many eyes followed them as they crossed Trafalgar Square and dodged the traffic flowing around the base of King Charles 's statue .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 28]: An alert recruiting-sergeant , clinching the argument , pointed out the tall , well-groomed officer to a lanky youth whose soul was almost afire with martial decision .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 30]: `` There y' are , '' he said , with emphatic thumb-jerk , `` that 's wot the British army will make of you in a couple of months .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 17]: An ' just twig the sort o ' girl you can sort out of the bunch .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 12]: Cock yer eye at _ that _ , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 18]: Thus , all unconsciously , Irene started the great adventure for one of Kitchener 's first half-million .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 11]: She was not kept waiting many minutes in an ante-room .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 43]: Dalroy reappeared , smiling mysteriously , yet , as Irene quickly saw , not quite so content with life as when he entered those magic portals , wherein a man wrestles with an algebraical formula before he finds the department he wants .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 26]: `` Well , '' she inquired , `` having picked your brains , are they going to court-martial you for being absent without leave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 18]: `` I cross to-night , '' he said , leading her toward the Horse Guards ' Parade .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 8]: `` It 's Belgium , not France .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 6]: I 'm on the staff .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 9]: My appointment will appear in the gazette to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 21]: That 's fine , but I 'd rather -- '' Irene stopped , almost in the middle of the road .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 26]: `` And you 'll wear a cap with a red band and a golden lion , and those ducky little red tabs on the collar !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 8]: Come at once , and buy them !
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 9]: I refuse to lunch with you otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 19]: `` A man must not wear the staff insignia until he is gazetted , '' he reminded her .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 5]: She was pathetically disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 48]: `` But , in my case , '' he went on , `` I am specifically ordered to travel in staff uniform , so , as I leave London at seven o'clock -- '' `` You can certainly lunch in all your glory , '' she vowed .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 8]: `` There 's an empty taxi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 86]: Of course , it was pleasant to be on the staff , and thus become even more admired by Irene , if there is a degree surpassing that which is already superlative ; but the fly in the ointment of Dalroy 's new career lay in the fact that the battle of the Aisne was just beginning , and every British heart throbbed with the hope that the Teuton hordes might be chased back to the frontier as speedily as they had rushed on Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 29]: Dalroy himself , an experienced soldier , though he had watched those grim columns pouring through the valley of the Meuse , yielded momentarily to the vision splendid .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 12]: He longed to be there , taking part in the drive .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 49]: Instead , he was being sent to Belgium , some shrewd head in the War Office having decided that his linguistic powers , joined to a recent first-hand knowledge of local conditions , would be far more profitably employed in Flanders than as a squadron leader in France .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 40]: Thus , when that day of mellow autumn had sped all too swiftly , and he had said his last good-bye to Irene , it was to Dover he went , being ferried thence to Ostend in a destroyer .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 47]: In those early weeks of the war all England was agog with the belief that Antwerp would prove a rankling thorn in the ribs of the Germans , while men in high places cherished the delusion that a flank attack was possible along the Ostend-Bruges-Brussels line .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: But Dalroy was an eminently sane person .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 12]: Two hours of clear thinking in the train re-established his poise .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 40]: When the Lieutenant-Commander in charge of the destroyer took him below in mid-Channel for a smoke and a drink , and the talk turned on strategy , the soldier dispelled an alluring mirage with a breath of common sense .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 14]: `` The scheme is nothing short of rank lunacy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 25]: `` We have n't the men , France can spare none of hers , and Belgium must be crushed when the big battalions meet .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 11]: Germany has at least three millions in the field already .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 8]: Paris has been saved by a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 29]: By some other miracle we may check the on-rush in France , but , if we start dividing our forces , even Heaven wo n't help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 15]: `` Surely you 'll admit that we should strengthen the defence of Antwerp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 4]: argued the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 6]: `` I think it impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 11]: Liège only held out until the new siege howitzers arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 5]: Namur fell at once .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 10]: Why should we expect Antwerp to be impregnable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 49]: The navy deemed the army pessimistic , but , exactly a month later , the Lieutenant-Commander remembered that conversation , and remarked to a friend that about the middle of September he took to Ostend `` a chap on the Staff who seemed to know a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 37]: It is now a matter of historical fact when Von Kluck and Sir John French began their famous race to the north , the Belgian army only escaped from Antwerp by the skin of its teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 46]: The city itself was occupied by the Germans on October 9th , Bruges was entered on the 13th , Von Bessler 's army reached the coast on the 15th , and the British and Belgians were attacked on the line of the Yser next day .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 25]: Thus , fate decreed that Dalroy should witness the beginning and the end of Germany 's shameless outrage on a peaceful and peace-loving country .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 20]: On August 2nd , 1914 , King Albert ruled over the most prosperous and contented small kingdom in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 26]: Within eleven weeks he had become , as Emile Cammaerts finely puts it , `` lord of a hundred fields and a few spires . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 36]: Though Dalroy should live far beyond the alloted span of man 's life , he will never forget the strain , the misery , the sheer hopelessness of the second month he spent in Belgium .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 44]: The climax came when he found himself literally overwhelmed by the host of refugees , wounded men , and scattered military units which sought succour in , and , as the iron ring of _ Kultur _ drew close , transport from Ostend .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 35]: With the retreat of the Belgian army towards Dunkirk , and the return to England of such portion of the ill-fated Naval Division as was not interned in Holland , his military duties ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 28]: In his own and the country 's interests he ought to have made certain of a berth on the last passenger steamer to leave Ostend for England .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 53]: He , at least , could have done so , though there were sixty thousand frenzied people crowding the quays , and hundreds , if not thousands , of comparatively wealthy men offering fabulous sums for the use of any type of vessel which would take them and their families to safety .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 45]: But , at the eleventh hour , Dalroy heard that a British Red Cross Hospital party , which had extricated itself from the clutch of the mailéd fist , was even then _ en route _ from Bruges to Ostend by way of Zeebrugge .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 38]: Knowing they would be in dire need of help , he resolved to stay , though his action was quixotic , since no mercy would be shown him if he fell into the hands of the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 7]: He took one precaution , therefore .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 32]: Some service rendered to a tradesman had enabled him to buy a reliable and speedy motor bicycle , on which , as a last resource , he might scurry to Dunkirk .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 14]: His field service baggage was reposing in a small hotel near the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 43]: For all he can tell , it is reposing there yet ; he never saw it again after he leaped into the saddle of the Ariel , and sped through the cobbled streets which led to the north road along the coast .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 14]: The hour was then about six o'clock on the evening of October 13th .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 20]: A Belgian staff officer had assured him that the Germans could not possibly occupy Ostend until late next day .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 16]: The Belgian army , though hopelessly outnumbered , had never been either disorganised nor outmanoeuvred .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 23]: The retreat to the Yser , if swift , was orderly , and the rearguard could be trusted to follow its time-table .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 17]: Hence , before it was dark , Dalroy determined to cover the sixteen miles to Zeebrugge .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 27]: The Hospital , which was convoying British and Belgian wounded , would travel thence by the quaint steam-tramway which links up the towns on the littoral .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 39]: It might experience almost insuperable difficulties at Zeebrugge or Ostend , and he was one of the few aware of the actual time-limit at disposal , while a field hospital bereft of transport is a peculiarly impotent organisation .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 11]: Road and rail ran almost parallel among the sand dunes .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 46]: At various crossings he could ascertain whether or not any train had passed recently in the direction of Ostend , thus making assurance doubly sure , though the station-master at the town terminus was positive that the next tram would not arrive until half-past seven .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 8]: Dalroy meant intercepting that tram at Blankenberge .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 28]: Naturally , the train was late in reaching the latter place , but the only practicable course was to wait there , rather than risk missing it .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 18]: A crowd of terrified people gathered around the calm-eyed , quiet-mannered Briton , and appealed for advice .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 3]: Poor creatures !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 6]: they imposed a cruel dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 36]: On the one hand , it was monstrous to send a whole community flying for their lives along the Ostend road ; on the other , he had witnessed the fate of Visé and Huy .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 38]: Yet , by remaining in their homes , they had some prospect of life and ultimate liberty , while their lot would be far worse the instant they were plunged into the panic and miseries of Ostend .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 30]: So he comforted the unhappy folk as best he might , though his heart was wrung with pity at sight of the common faith in the Red Cross brassard .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 11]: Men , women , and children wore the badge indiscriminately .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 12]: They regarded it as a shield against the Uhlan 's lance !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 22]: Most fortunately for that strip of Belgium , the policy of `` frightfulness '' was moderated once the country was overrun .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 26]: So far as local occurrences have been permitted to become known , the coast towns have been spared the fate of those in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 16]: To Dalroy 's great relief , the incoming tram from Zeebrugge brought the British hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 42]: There were four doctors , eight nurses , and fifty-three wounded men , including a sergeant and ten privates of the Gordon Highlanders , who , like Bates , Smithy , and the rest , had scrambled across Belgium after Mons .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 7]: The train offered an extraordinary spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 11]: Soldiers and civilians were packed in it and on it .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 25]: Men and women sat precariously on the roofs of the ramshackle carriages , stood on the buffers and couplings , or clung to door-handles .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 17]: Not even foothold was to be had for love or money on that train at Blankenberge .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 22]: Dalroy , who dared not let go his machine , contrived to get a word with the Medical Officer in charge .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 11]: As ever , the Briton made light of past troubles .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 11]: `` We 've had the time of our lives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 5]: was the cheery comment .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 22]: `` After Mons we were left in a field hospital with a mixed crowd of British , French , and Germans .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 39]: Of course , we looked after all alike , and that saved our bacon , because even a German general had to try and behave decently when he found a thousand of his own men in our care .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 38]: So he sent us to Brussels with a safe conduct , and from Brussels we were allowed to make for Ostend -- had to leg it , though , the last twenty miles to the Belgian outposts .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 22]: Then we refitted , and started for Bruges , where we 've been at work in a convent for five weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 33]: The remnant of the Belgian army passed through Bruges yesterday and the day before , so we cleared out all possible cases , and started away with the crocks early this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 18]: At the last minute we were hustled a bit by a Taube dropping bombs on the station .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 10]: One bomb took from us a van-load of kit .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 15]: We have n't a thing except the stretchers and what we 're wearing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 17]: `` I 'll ride on now , and meet you at Ostend , '' said Dalroy .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 20]: He had not the heart to damp the spirits of the party by telling of the chaos awaiting them .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 11]: Sufficient for the next hour would be the evil thereof .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 21]: `` I say , it 's awfully good of you to take all this trouble , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 27]: `` I 've lost my job with the departure of our troops , so I had to find something to do , '' smiled the other .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 30]: A fleet of Belgian armoured cars cleared a road through the stream of fugitives , and Dalroy kept close in rear , so he made a fast return journey .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 23]: Dashing past the town station , near which the steam-tram would disgorge its freight , he headed straight for the Gare Maritime .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 40]: It was now dusk , but he saw at once that the crowd besieging the entrance was denser and more frantic than ever , though the last steamer whose departure was announced officially had left early in the day .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 40]: He ascertained from a helpless policeman that the rumour had gone round of a vessel coming in ; the sullen , apathetic multitude , waiting there for it knew not what chance of rescue , had suddenly become dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 24]: `` The American Consul , who has worked hard all day , has had to give it up , '' added the man .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 8]: `` He is closing his office . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 30]: Just then a harbour official , minus his cap , and with coat badly torn during a violent passage through the mob , strode by , breathless but hurried .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 17]: Dalroy recognised him , having had much business with the port authorities during the preceding week .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 12]: `` Is it true that a steamer is in sight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 10]: `` Monsieur , what am I to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 7]: and the accompanying gesture was eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 13]: `` It is only a little cargo boat , an English coaster .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 18]: If she nears the quay there will be a riot , and perhaps thousands of lives lost .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 22]: The harbour-master has sent me to ask the mayor if he should not signal her to anchor outside until daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 11]: Prompt decision and steadfast action were Dalroy 's chief qualities .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 24]: If luck favoured him he might set his own project on foot before the mayor 's messenger burked it by a civic order .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 8]: He thanked the man and rode off .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 10]: Happily the tram came from Blankenberge without undue delay .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 13]: He had only dismounted when the engine clanked into the station square .
