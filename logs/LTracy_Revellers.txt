Parsing [sent. 1 len. 50]: THE REVELLERS BY LOUIS TRACY CHAPTER I QUESTIONINGS `` And the king was much moved , and went up to the chamber over the gate , and wept : and as he went , thus he said , O my son Absalom , my son , my son Absalom !
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 18]: Would God I had died for thee , O Absalom , my son , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 16]: The voice of the reader was strident , his utterance uneven , his diction illiterate .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 24]: Yet he concluded the 18th chapter of the second Book of Samuel with an unctuous force born of long familiarity with the text .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: His laborious drone revealed no consciousness of the humanism of the Jewish King .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 59]: To suggest that the Bible contained a mine of literature , a series of stories of surpassing interest , portraying as truthfully the lives of the men and women of to-day as of the nomad race which a personal God led through the wilderness , would have provoked from this man 's mouth a sluggish flood of protest .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 69]: The slow-moving lips , set tight after each syllabic struggle , the shaggy eyebrows overhanging horn-rimmed spectacles , the beetling forehead and bull-like head sunk between massive shoulders , the very clutch of the big hands on the Bible held stiffly at a distance , bespoke a triumphant dogmatism that found as little actuality in the heartbroken cry of David as in a description of a seven-branched candlestick .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 25]: The boy who listened wondered why people should `` think such a lot about '' high priests and kings who died so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 8]: David was interesting enough as a youth .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 28]: The slaying of Goliath , the charming of Saul with sweet music on a harp , appealed to the vivid , if unformed , imagination of fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 25]: But the temptation of the man , the splendid efforts of the monarch to rule a peevish people -- these were lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 18]: Worse , they wearied him , because , as it happened , he had a reasoning brain .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 9]: He refused to credit all that he heard .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 41]: It was hard to believe that any man 's hair could catch in an oak so that he should be lifted up between heaven and earth , merely because he rode beneath the tree on the back of a mule .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 17]: This sounded like the language of exaggeration , and sturdy little Martin Court Bolland hated exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 26]: Again , he took the winged words literally , and the ease with which David saw , heard , spoke to the Lord was disturbing .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 44]: Such things were manifestly impossible if David resembled other men , and that there were similarities between the ruler of Israel and certain male inhabitants of Elmsdale was suggested by numberless episodes of the very human history writ in the Book of Kings .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 54]: `` The Lord '' was a terrific personality to Martin -- a personality seated on thunder-cloud , of which the upper rim of gold and silver , shining gloriously against a cerulean sky , was Heaven , and the sullen blackness beneath , from which thunder bellowed and lightning flashed , was Hell .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 55]: How could a mere man , one who pursued women like a too susceptible plowman , one who `` smote '' his fellows , and `` kissed '' them , and ate with them , hold instant communion with the tremendous Unseen , the ruler of sun and storm , the mover of worlds ?
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 58]: `` David inquired of the Lord '' ; `` David said to the Lord '' ; `` The Lord answered unto David '' -- these phrases tortured a busy intelligence , and caused the big brown eyes to flash restlessly toward the distant hills , while quick ears and retentive brain paid close heed to the text .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 16]: For it was the word , not the spirit , that John Bolland insisted on .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 10]: The boy knew too well the penalty of forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 53]: During half an hour , from five o'clock each day , he was led drearily through the Sacred Book ; if he failed to answer correctly the five minutes ' questioning which followed , the lesson was repeated , verse for verse , again , and yet again , as a punishment .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 14]: At half-past four o'clock the high tea of a north-country farmhouse was served .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 30]: Then the huge Bible was produced solemnly , and no stress of circumstances , no temporary call of other business , was permitted to interfere with this daily task .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 19]: At times , Bolland would be absent at fairs or detained in some distant portion of the farm .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 24]: But Martin 's `` portion of the Scriptures '' would be marked for careful reading , and severe corporal chastisement corrected any negligence .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 42]: Such was the old farmer 's mania in this regard that his portly , kind-hearted wife became as strict as John himself in supervising the boy 's lesson , merely because she dreaded the scene that would follow the slightest lapse .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 30]: So Martin could answer glibly that Ahimaaz was the son of Zadok and that Joab plunged three darts into Absalom 's heart while the scapegrace dangled from the oak .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 33]: Of the love that David bore his son , of the statecraft that impelled a servant of Israel to slay the disturber of the national peace , there was never a hint .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 8]: Bolland 's stark Gospel was harshly definite .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 18]: There was no channel in his gnarled soul for the turbulent life-stream flowing through the ancient text .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 37]: The cold-blooded murder of Absalom , it is true , induced in the boy 's mind a certain degree of belief in the narrative , a belief somewhat strained by the manner of Absalom 's capture .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 16]: Through his brain danced a _ tableau vivant _ of the scene in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 29]: He saw the gayly caparisoned mule gallop madly away , leaving its rider struggling with desperate arms to free his hair from the rough grasp of the oak .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 28]: Then , through the trees came a startled man-at-arms , who ran back and brought one other , a stately warrior in accouterments that shone like silver .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 63]: A squabble arose between them as to the exact nature of the King 's order concerning this same Absalom , but it was speedily determined by the leader , Joab , snatching three arrows from the soldier 's quiver and plunging them viciously , one after the other , into the breast of the man hanging between the heaven and the earth .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 8]: Martin wondered if Absalom spoke to Joab .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 6]: Did he cry for mercy ?
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 10]: Did his eyes glare awfully at his relentless foe ?
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 19]: Did he squeal pitiful gibberish like Tom Chandler did when he chopped off his fingers in the hay-cutter ?
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 37]: How beastly it must be to be suspended by your own hair , and see a man come forward with three barbed darts which he sticks into your palpitating bosom , probably cursing you the while !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 53]: And then appeared from the depths of the wood ten young men , who behaved like cowardly savages , for they hacked the poor corpse with sword and spear , and made mock of a gallant if erring soldier who would have slain them all if he met them on equal terms .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 23]: This was the picture that flitted before the boy 's eyes , and for one instant his tongue forgot its habitual restraint .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 27]: `` Father , '' he said , `` why did n't David ask God to save his son , if he wished him to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 10]: `` Nay , lad , I doa n't kno√§ .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 20]: You mun listen te what 's written i ' t ' Book -- no more an ' no less .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: I doa n't ho 'd wi ' their commentaries an ' explanations , an ' what oor passon calls anilitical disquisitions .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 9]: Tak ' t ' Word as it stands .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 10]: That 's all ` at any man wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 24]: Now , be it observed that the boy used good English , whereas the man spoke in the broad dialect of the dales .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 41]: Moreover , Bolland , an out-and-out Dissenter , was clannish enough to speak of `` our '' parson , meaning thereby the vicar of the parish , a gentleman whom he held at arm 's length in politics and religion .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 44]: The latter discrepancy was a mere village colloquialism ; the other -- the marked difference between father and son -- was startling , not alone by reason of their varying speech , but by the queer contrast they offered in manners and appearance .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 50]: Bolland was a typical yeoman of the moor edge , a tall , strong man , twisted and bent like the oak which betrayed Absalom , slow in his movements , heavy of foot , and clothed in brown corduroy which resembled curiously the weatherbeaten bark of a tree .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 36]: There was a rugged dignity in his bearded face , and the huge spectacles he had now pushed high up on his forehead lent a semblance of greater age than he could lay claim to .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 18]: Yet was he a lineal descendant of Gurth , the swineherd , Gurth , uncouth and unidealized .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 20]: The boy , a sturdy , country-built youngster in figure and attire , had a face of much promise .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 25]: His brow was lofty and open , his mouth firm and well formed , his eyes fearless , if a trifle dreamy at times .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 14]: His hands , too , were not those of a farmer 's son .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 23]: Strong they were and scarred with much use , but the fingers tapered elegantly , and the thumbs were long and straight .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 26]: Certainly , the heavy-browed farmer , with his drooping nether lip and clumsy spatulate digits , had not bequeathed these bucolic attributes to his son .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 40]: As they sat there , in the cheerful kitchen where the sunbeams fell on sanded floor and danced on the burnished contents of a full `` dresser , '' they presented a dissimilarity that was an outrage on heredity .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 16]: Usually , the reading ended , Martin effaced himself by way of the back door .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 45]: Thence , through a garden orchard that skirted the farmyard , he would run across a meadow , jump two hedges into the lane which led back to the village street , and so reach the green where the children played after school hours .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 11]: He was forced early to practice a degree of dissimulation .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 19]: Though he hated a lie , he at least acted a reverent appreciation of the chapter just perused .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 30]: His boyish impulses lay with the cricketers , the minnow-catchers , the players of prisoner 's base , the joyous patrons of well-worn `` pitch '' and gurgling brook .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 26]: But he knew that the slightest indication of grudging this daily half-hour would mean the confiscation of the free romp until supper-time at half-past eight .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 32]: So he paid heed to the lesson , and won high praise from his preceptor in the oft-expressed opinion : `` Martin will make a rare man i ' time . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 9]: To-day he did not hurry away as usual .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 74]: For one reason , he was going with a gamekeeper to see some ferreting at six o'clock , and there was plenty of time ; for another , it thrilled him to find that there were episodes in the Bible quite as exciting as any in the pages of `` The Scalp-Hunters , '' a forbidden work now hidden with others in the store of dried bracken at the back of the cow-byre .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 14]: So he said rather carelessly : `` I wonder if he kicked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 8]: `` You wunner if whe√§ kicked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 5]: came the slow response .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 8]: `` Absalom , when Joab stabbed him .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 17]: The other day , when the pigs were killed , they all kicked like mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 14]: Bolland laid down the Bible and glanced at Martin with a puzzled air .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: He was not annoyed or even surprised at the unlooked-for deduction .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 21]: It had simply never occurred to him that one might read the Bible and construct actualities from the plain-spoken text .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 8]: `` Hoo div ' I kno√§ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 17]: he said calmly ; `` it says nowt about it i ' t ' chapter . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 7]: Then Martin awoke with a start .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 22]: He saw how nearly he had betrayed himself a second time , how ready were the lips to utter ungoverned thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 4]: He flushed slightly .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 10]: `` Is that all for to-day , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 13]: Before Bolland could answer , there came a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 15]: `` See whe√§ that is , '' said the farmer , readjusting his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 8]: A big , hearty-looking young man entered .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 21]: He wore clothes of a sporting cut and carried a hunting-crop , with the long lash gathered in his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 15]: `` Oah , it 's you , is it , Mr. Pickerin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 22]: said Bolland , and Martin 's quick ears caught a note of restraint , almost of hostility , in the question .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 13]: `` Yes , Mr. Bolland , an ' how are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 6]: was the more friendly greeting .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 14]: `` I just dropped in to have a settlement about that beast . ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 4]: `` A sattlement !
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: What soart o ' sattlement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 15]: The visitor sat down , uninvited , and produced some papers from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 42]: `` Well , Mr. Bolland , '' he said quietly , `` it 's not more 'n four months since I gave you sixty pounds for a thoroughbred shorthorn , supposed to be in calf to Bainesse Boy the Third . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 8]: `` Right enough , Mr. Pickerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 17]: You 've gotten t ' certificates and t ' receipt for t ' stud fee . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 9]: Martin detected the latent animosity in both voices .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 18]: The reiterated use of the prefix `` Mr. '' was an exaggerated politeness that boded a dispute .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: `` Receipts , certificates ! ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 4]: cried Pickering testily .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 8]: `` What good are they to me ?
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 7]: She can not carry a calf .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: For all the use I can make of her , I might as well have thrown the money in the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 19]: `` Eh , but she 's a well-bred ` un , '' said Bolland , with sapient head-shake .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 32]: `` She might be a first-prize winner at the Royal by her shape and markings ; but , as matters stand , she 'll bring only fifteen pounds from a butcher .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 11]: I stand to lose forty-five pounds by the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 18]: `` You canna fly i ' t ' fe√§ce o ' Providence , Mr. Pickerin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 12]: `` Providence has little to do with it , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 18]: I can sell her to somebody else , if I like to work a swindle with her .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 14]: I had my doubts at the time that she was too cheap . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 4]: John Bolland rose .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 26]: His red face was dusky with anger , and it sent a pang through Martin 's heart to see something of fear there , too .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 11]: `` Noo , what are ye drivin ' at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 8]: he growled , speaking with ominous calmness .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 12]: `` You know well enough , '' came the straight answer .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 18]: `` The poor thing has something wrong with her , and she will never hold a calf .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 12]: Look here , Bolland , meet me fairly in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 34]: Either give me back twenty pounds , and we 'll cry ` quits , ' or sell me another next spring at the same price , and I 'll take my luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 16]: Perhaps this _ via media _ might have been adopted had it presented itself earlier .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 21]: But the word `` swindle '' stuck in the farmer 's throat , and he sank back into his chair .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 9]: `` Nay , nay , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 7]: `` A bargain 's a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 17]: You 've gotten t ' papers -- '' It was the buyer 's turn to rise .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 11]: `` To the devil with you and your papers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 14]: `` Do you think I came here without making sure of my facts ?
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 17]: Twice has this cow been in calf in your byre , and each time she missed .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 12]: You knew her failing , and sold her under false pretenses .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 28]: Of course , I can not prove it , or I would have the law of you ; but I did think you would act squarely . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 12]: For some reason the elder Bolland was in a towering rage .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 25]: Martin had never before seen him so angry , and the boy was perplexed by the knowledge that what Pickering said was quite true .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 24]: `` I 'll not be sworn at nor threatened wi ' t ' law in my own house , '' bellowed the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 4]: `` Get out !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 15]: Look tiv ' your own business an ' leave me te follow mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 10]: Pickering , too , was in a mighty temper .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 15]: He took a half stride forward and shook out the thong of the whip .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 6]: `` You psalm-singing humbug ! ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 3]: he thundered .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 23]: `` If you were a younger man -- '' Martin jumped between them ; his right hand clenched a heavy kitchen poker .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 11]: Pickering half turned to the door with a bitter laugh .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 9]: `` All right , my young cub ! ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 17]: `` I 'm not such a fool , thank goodness , as to make bad worse .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 22]: It 's lucky for you , boy , that you are not of the same kidney as that old ranter there .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 14]: Catch me ever having more to do with any of his breed . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 20]: `` An ' what affair is it of yours , Mr. Pickerin ' , who the boy belongs to ?
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 23]: If all tales be true , _ you _ ca n't afford to throw stones at other folks 's glass houses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 30]: Mrs. Bolland , stout , hooded , aproned , and fiery red in face , had come from the dairy , and now took a hand in the argument .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 26]: Pickering , annoyed at the unlooked-for presence of a woman , said sternly : `` Talk to your husband , not to me , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 55]: He wronged me by getting three times the value for a useless beast , and if you can convince him that he took an unfair advantage , I 'm willing , even now -- '' But Mrs. Bolland had caught the flicker of amazement in Martin 's eye and was not to be mollified .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 12]: `` Who are you , I 'd like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 16]: she shrilled , `` coomin ' te one 's house an ' scandalizin ' us ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 20]: A nice thing , to be sure , for a man like you to call John Bolland a wrongdoer .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 10]: The cow wo n't calve , wo n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 11]: 'T is a dispensation on you , George Pickerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 9]: You 're payin ' for yer own misdeeds .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 17]: There 's plenty i ' Elmsdale whe√§ ken your char-ak-ter , let me tell you that .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 9]: What 's become o ' Betsy Thwaites ? ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: But Pickering had resigned the contest .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 34]: He was striding toward the `` Black Lion , '' where a dogcart awaited him , and he laughed to himself as the flood of vituperation swelled from the door of the farm .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 13]: he muttered , `` how these women must cackle in the market !
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 11]: One old cow is hardly worth so much fuss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 42]: Still smiling at the storm he had raised , he gathered the reins , gave Fred , the ostler , a sixpence , and would have driven off had he not seen a pretty serving-maid gazing out through an upper window .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 5]: Her face looked familiar .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 13]: `` You and I know each other , do n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 21]: `` No , we doa n't ; an ' we 're not likely to , '' was the pert reply .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 5]: `` Eh , my !
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 7]: What have I done now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 13]: `` Nowt to me , but my sister is Betsy Thwaites . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 6]: `` The deuce she is !
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 10]: Betsy is n't half as nice-looking as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 10]: `` More shame on you that says it . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 18]: `` But , my dear girl , one should tell the truth and shame the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 7]: `` Just listen to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 34]: Yet the window was raised a little higher , and the girl leaned out , for Pickering was a handsome man , with a tremendous reputation for gallantry of a somewhat pronounced type .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 15]: Fred , the stable help , struck the cob smartly with his open hand .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 14]: Pickering swore , and bade him leave the mare alone and be off .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 27]: `` I was sorry for Betsy , '' he said , when the prancing pony was quieted , `` but she and I agreed to differ .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 17]: I got her a place at Hereford , and hope she 'll be married soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 24]: `` You 'll get me no place at Hereford , Mr. Pickerin ' '' -- this with a coquettish toss of the head .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 7]: When is the feast here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 7]: `` Next Monday it starts . ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 2]: Good-by .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: I 'll see you on Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 10]: He blew her a kiss , and she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 13]: As the smart turnout rattled through the village she looked after him .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 15]: `` Betsy always did say he was such a man , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 17]: `` I 'll smack his fe√§ce , though , if he comes near me a-Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 17]: And Fred , leaning sulkily over the yard gate , spat viciously on Pickering 's sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 13]: `` Coomin ' here for t ' fe√§st , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 11]: `` Happen he 'd better bide i ' Nottonby . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 12]: CHAPTER II STRANGERS , INDEED Pickering left ruffled breasts behind him .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 31]: The big farm in the center of the village was known as the White House , and had been owned by a Bolland since there were Bollands in the county .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 19]: It was perched on a bank that rose steeply some twenty feet or more from the main road .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 13]: Cartways of stiff gradient led down to the thoroughfare on either hand .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 27]: A strong retaining wall , crowned with gooseberry bushes , marked the confines of the garden , which adjoined a row of cottages tenanted by laborers .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 27]: Then came the White House itself , thatched , cleanly , comfortable-looking ; beyond it , all fronting on the road , were stables and outbuildings .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 53]: Behind lay the remainder of the kitchen garden and an orchard , backed by a strip of meadowland that climbed rapidly toward the free moor with its whins and heather -- a far-flung range of mountain given over to grouse and hardy sheep , and cleft by tiny ravines of exceeding beauty .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 38]: Across the village street stood some modern iron-roofed buildings , where Bolland kept his prize stock , and here was situated the real approach to the couple of hundred acres of rich arable land which he farmed .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 14]: The house and rear pastures were his own ; he rented the rest .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 30]: Of late years he had ceased to grow grain , save for the limited purposes of his stock , and had gone in more and more for pedigree cattle .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 16]: Pickering 's words had hurt him sorely , since they held an element of truth .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 26]: The actual facts were these : One of his best cows had injured herself by jumping a fence , and a calf was born prematurely .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 12]: Oddly enough , a similar accident had occurred the following year .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 40]: On the third occasion , when the animal was mated with Bainesse Boy III , Bolland thought it best not to tempt fortune again , but sold her for something less than the enhanced value which the circumstances warranted .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 43]: From a similar dam and the same sire he bred a yearling bull which realized # 250 , or nearly the rent of his holding , so Pickering had really overstated his case , making no allowance for the lottery of stock-raising .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 12]: The third calf might have been normal and of great value .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 4]: It was not .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 10]: Bolland suspected the probable outcome and had acted accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 15]: It was the charge of premeditated unfairness that rankled and caused him such heart-burning .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 45]: When Mrs. Bolland , turkey-red in face , and with eyes still glinting fire , came in and slammed the door , she told Martin , angrily , to be off , and not stand there with his ears cocked like a terrier 's .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 5]: The boy went out .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 8]: He did not follow his accustomed track .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 9]: He hesitated whether or not to go rabbiting .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 34]: Although far too young to attach serious import to the innuendoes he had heard , he could not help wondering what Pickering meant by that ironical congratulation on the subject of his paternity .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 26]: His mother , too , had not repelled the charge directly , but had gone out of her way to heap counter-abuse on the vilifier .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 39]: It was odd , to say the least of it , and he found himself wishing heartily that either the unfortunate cow had not been sold or that his father had met Mr. Pickering 's protests more reasonably .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 13]: A whistle came from the lane that led up to the moor .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 9]: Perched on a gate was a white-headed urchin .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 12]: `` Are n't ye coomin ' te t ' green ? ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 10]: was his cry , seeing that Martin heard him .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 8]: `` Not this evening , thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 6]: `` Oah , coom on .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 17]: They 're playin ' tig , an ' none of 'em can ketch Jim Bates . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 4]: That settled it .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 13]: Jim Bates 's pride must be lowered , and ferrets were forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 7]: But Jim Bates had his revenge .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 21]: If he could not run as fast as Martin , he made an excellent pawn in the hands of fortune .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 38]: Had the boy gone to the rabbit warren , he would not have seen the village again until after eight o'clock , and , possibly , the current of his life might have entered a different runnel .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 38]: In the event , however , he was sauntering up the village street , when he encountered a lady and a little girl , accompanied by a woman whose dress reminded him of nuns seen in pictures .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 30]: The three were complete strangers , and although Martin was unusually well-mannered for one reared in a remote Yorkshire hamlet , he could not help staring at them fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 36]: The Normandy nurse alone was enough to draw the eyes of the whole village , and Martin knew well it was owing to mere chance that a crowd of children was not following her already .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 9]: The lady was tall and of stately carriage .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 10]: She was dressed quietly , but in excellent taste .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 19]: Her very full face looked remarkably pink , and her large blue eyes stared out of puffy sockets .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 36]: Beyond these unfavorable details , she was a handsome woman , and the boy thought vaguely that she must have motored over from the castle midway between Elmsdale and the nearest market town of Nottonby .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 13]: Yet it was on the child that his wondering gaze dwelt longest .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 7]: She looked about ten years old .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 28]: Her elfin face was enshrined in jet-black hair , and two big bright eyes glanced inquiringly at him from the depths of a wide-brimmed , flowered-covered hat .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 23]: A broad blue sash girdled her white linen dress ; the starched skirts stood out like the frills of a ballet dancer .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 19]: Her shapely legs were bare from above the knees , and her tiny feet were encased in sandals .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 28]: At Trouville she would be pronounced `` sweet '' by enthusiastic admirers of French fashion , but in a north-country village she was absurdly out of place .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 18]: Nevertheless , being a remarkably self-possessed little maiden , she returned with interest Martin 's covert scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 20]: He would have passed on , but the lady lifted a pair of mounted eyeglasses and spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 23]: `` Boy , '' she said in a flute-like voice , `` can you tell me which is the White House ? ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 6]: Martin 's cap flew off .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 11]: `` Yes , ma'am , '' he said , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 5]: `` That is it .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 5]: I live there . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 5]: `` Oh , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 7]: And what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 8]: `` Martin Court Bolland , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 6]: `` What an odd name .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 8]: Why were you christened Martin Court ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 9]: `` I really do n't know , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 20]: I did n't bother about it at the time , and since then have never troubled to inquire . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 15]: Now , to be candid , Martin did not throw off this retort spontaneously .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 21]: It was a little effusion built up through the years , the product of frequent necessity to answer the question .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 15]: But the lady took it as a coruscation of rustic wit , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 21]: She turned to the nurse : `` Il m ' a rendu la monnaie de ma pi√®ce , Fran√ßoise . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 17]: `` J'en suis bien s√ªr , madame , mais qu'est - ce qu'il a dit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 4]: said the nurse .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 10]: The other translated rapidly , and the nurse grinned .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 14]: `` Ah , il est na√Øf , le petit , '' she commented .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 6]: `` Et tr√®s gentil . ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 28]: `` Oh , maman , '' chimed in the child , `` je serais heureuse si vous vouliez me permettre de jouer avec ce joli gar√ßon . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 6]: `` Attendez , ma belle .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 16]: Pas si vite ... Now , Martin Court , take me to your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 19]: Not knowing exactly what to do with his cap , the boy had kept it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 15]: The foregoing conversation was , of course , so much Greek in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 20]: He realized that they were talking about him , and was fully alive to the girl 's demure admiration .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 23]: The English words came with the more surprise , seeing that they followed so quickly on some remark in an unknown tongue .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 20]: He led the way at once , hoping that his mother had regained her normal condition of busy cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 12]: Silence reigned in the front kitchen when he pressed the latch .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 40]: The room was empty , but the clank of pattens in the yard revealed that the farmer 's thrifty wife was sparing her skirts from the dirt while she crossed to the pig tub with a pailful of garbage .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 10]: `` Will you take a seat , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 4]: said Martin politely .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 10]: `` I 'll tell mother you are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 23]: With a slight awkwardness he pulled three oaken chairs from the serried rank they occupied along the wall beneath the high-silled windows .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: Feeling all eyes fixed on him quizzically , he blushed .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 11]: `` Ah , v ` l√† le p ` tit .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 4]: Il rougit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 4]: laughed the nurse .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 9]: `` Do n't tease him , nurse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 6]: cried the child in English .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 7]: `` He is a nice boy .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: I like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: Clearly this was for Martin 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 8]: Already the young lady was a coquette .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 17]: Mrs. Bolland , hearing there were `` ladies '' to visit her , entered with trepidation .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 16]: She expected to meet the vicar 's aunt and one of that lady 's friends .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 26]: In a moment of weakness she had consented to take charge of the refreshment stall at a forthcoming bazaar in aid of certain church funds .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 25]: But Bolland was told that the incumbent was adopting ritualistic practices , so he sternly forbade his better half to render any assistance whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 23]: The Established Church was bad enough ; it was a positive scandal to introduce into the service aught that savored of Rome .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 39]: Poor Mrs. Bolland therefore racked her brain for a reasonable excuse as she crossed the yard , and it is not to be wondered at if she was struck almost dumb with surprise at sight of the strangers .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 7]: `` Are you Mrs. Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 18]: asked the lady , without rising , and surveying her through the eyeglasses with head tilted back .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 2]: Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 26]: I -- er -- am staying at The Elms for some few weeks , and the people there recommended you as supplying excellent dairy produce .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 20]: I am -- er -- exceedingly particular about butter and milk , as my little girl is so delicate .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 12]: Have you any objection to allowing me to inspect your dairy ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 16]: I may add that I will pay you well for all that I order . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 36]: The lady 's accent , no less than the even flow of her words , joined to unpreparedness for such fashionable visitors , temporarily bereft Mrs. Bolland of a quick , if limited , understanding .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 10]: `` Did ye say ye wanted soom bootermilk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 4]: she cried vacantly .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 10]: `` No , mother , '' interrupted Martin anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 30]: For the first time in his life he was aware of a hot and uncomfortable feeling that his mother was manifestly inferior to certain other people in the world .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 10]: `` The lady wishes to see the dairy . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 30]: `` She wants to buy things from you , and -- er -- I suppose she would like to see what sort of place we keep them in . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 28]: No manner of explanation could have restored Mrs. Bolland 's normal senses so speedily as the slightest hint that uncleanliness could harbor its microbes in her house .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 28]: `` My goodness , ma'am , '' she cried , `` whe√§ 's bin tellin ' you that my ple√§ce hez owt wrong wi ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 41]: Now it was the stranger 's turn to appeal to Martin , and the boy showed his mettle by telling his mother , in exact detail , the request made by the lady and her reference to the fragile-looking child .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 14]: Mrs. Bolland 's wrath subsided , and her lips widened in a smile .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 22]: `` Oah , if that 's all , '' she said , `` coom on , ma'am , an ' welcome .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 23]: Ye canna be too careful about sike things , an ' yer little lass do look pukey , te be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 20]: The lady , gathering her skirts for the perilous passage of the yard , followed the farmer 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 11]: Martin and the girl sat and stared at each other .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 8]: She it was who began the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 8]: `` Have you lived here long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: `` All my life , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 14]: Pretty and well-dressed as she was , he had no dread of her .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 21]: He regarded girls as spiteful creatures who scratched one another like cats when angry and shrieked hysterically when they played .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 11]: `` That 's not very long , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 15]: `` No ; but it 's longer than you 've lived anywhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 3]: `` Me !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 27]: I have lived everywhere -- in London , Berlin , Paris , Nice , Montreux -- O , je ne sais -- I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 8]: Perhaps you do n't speak French ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 8]: `` Would you like to learn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 7]: `` Yes , very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 6]: `` I 'll teach you .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 6]: It will be such fun .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 8]: I know all sorts of naughty words .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 21]: I learnt them in Monte Carlo , where I could hear the servants chattering when I was put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 6]: Watch me wake up nurse .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 5]: Fran√ßoise , mon chou !
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 15]: Cr√© nom d'un pipe , mais que vous √™tes triste aujourd ` hui ! ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 6]: The _ bonne _ started .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 6]: She shook the child angrily .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: `` You wicked girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 5]: she cried in French .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 12]: `` If madame heard you , she would blame me . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 12]: The imp cuddled her bare knees in a paroxysm of glee .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 8]: `` You see , '' she shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 7]: `` I told you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 7]: `` Was all that swearing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 4]: demanded Martin gravely .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 6]: `` Some of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 8]: `` Then you should n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 12]: If I were your brother , I 'd hammer you . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 8]: `` Oh , would you , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 13]: I 'd like to see any boy lay a finger on me .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 11]: I 'd tear his hair out by the roots . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 22]: Naturally , the talk languished for a while , until Martin thought he had perhaps been rude in speaking so brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 13]: `` I 'm sorry if I offended you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 7]: The saucy , wide-open eyes sparkled .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 9]: `` I forgive you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 7]: `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 3]: `` Fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 4]: `` Twelve . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: He was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 11]: `` I thought you were younger , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 5]: `` So does everybody .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 16]: You see , I 'm tiny , and mamma dresses me in this baby way .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 5]: I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 5]: I know your name .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 8]: You have n't asked me mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: `` Tell me , '' he said with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 3]: `` Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 4]: Ang√®le Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 14]: `` I 'll never be able to say that , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , you will .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 5]: It 's quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 17]: It sounds Frenchy , but I am English , except in my ways , mother says .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 3]: Now try .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 18]: Say ` An ' -- '' `` Ang -- '' `` Not so much through your nose .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 8]: This way -- ` An-g√®le . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 35]: The next effort was better , but tuition halted abruptly when Martin discovered that Ang√®le 's mother , instead of being `` Mrs. Saumarez , '' was `` the Baroness Irma von Edelstein . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 6]: `` Oh , crikey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 4]: he blurted out .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 7]: `` How can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 7]: Ang√®le laughed at his blank astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 11]: `` Mamma is a German baroness , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 23]: `` My papa was a colonel in the British army , but mamma did not lose her courtesy title when she married .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 11]: Of course , she is Mrs. Saumarez , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 15]: These subtleties of Burke and the Almanach de Gotha went over Martin 's head .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 17]: `` It sounds a bit like an entry in a stock catalogue , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 25]: Ang√®le , in turn , was befogged , but saw instantly that the village youth was not sufficiently reverent to the claims of rank .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 18]: `` You can never be a gentleman unless you learn these things , '' she announced airily .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: `` You do n't say , '' retorted Martin with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 41]: He was really far more intelligent than this pert monitress , and had detected a curious expression on the stolid face of Fran√ßoise when the Baroness von Edelstein 's name cropped up in a talk which she could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 27]: The truth was that the canny Norman woman , though willing enough to take a German mistress 's gold , thoroughly disliked the lady 's nationality .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 17]: Martin could only guess vaguely at something of the sort , but the mere guess sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 11]: Ang√®le , however , wanted no more bickering just then .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 17]: She was about to resume the lesson when the Baroness and Mrs. Bolland re-entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 26]: Evidently the inspection of the dairy had been satisfactory , and the lady had signified her approval in words that pleased the older woman greatly .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 64]: The visitor was delighted , too , with the old-world appearance of the kitchen , the heavy rafters with their load of hams and sides of bacon , the oaken furniture , the spotless white of the well-scrubbed ash-topped table , the solemn grandfather 's clock , and the rough stone floor , over which soft red sandstone had been rubbed when wet .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 56]: By this time the tact of the woman of society had accommodated her words and utterance to the limited comprehension of her hearer , and she displayed such genuine interest in the farm and its belongings that Mrs. Bolland gave her a hearty invitation to come next morning , when the light would be stronger .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 46]: Then `` John '' would let her see his prize stock and the extensive buildings on `` t ' other side o ' t ' road ... T ' kye -LRB- the cows -RRB- were fastened up for t ' neet '' by this time .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 14]: The baroness was puzzled , but managed to catch the speaker 's drift .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 12]: `` I do not rise very early , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 53]: `` I breakfast about eleven '' -- she could not imagine what a sensation this statement caused in a house where breakfast was served never later than seven o'clock -- `` and it takes me an hour to dress ; but I can call about twelve , if that will suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 13]: `` Ay , do , ma'am , '' was the cheery agreement .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 15]: `` You 'll be able te see t ' farmhands havin ' their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 20]: It 's a fair treat te watch them men an ' lads puttin ' away a beefsteak pie . ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 9]: `` And this is your little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 9]: said the other , evidently inclined for gossip .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 8]: `` He is a splendid little fellow .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 15]: What a nice name you gave him -- Martin Court Bolland -- so unusual .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 10]: How came you to select his Christian names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 14]: The question caused the farmer 's wife a good deal of unnoticed embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 34]: The baroness was looking idly at an old colored print of York Castle , and the boy himself was far too taken up with Ang√®le to listen to the chat of his elders .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 5]: Mrs. Bolland laughed confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 7]: `` Martin , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 27]: `` Tak t ' young leddy an ' t ' nurse as far as t ' brig , an ' show 'em t ' mill . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 15]: The baroness was surprised at this order , but an explanation was soon forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 17]: In her labored speech and broad dialect , the farmer 's wife revealed a startling romance .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 26]: Thirteen years ago her husband 's brother died suddenly while attending a show at Islington , and the funeral took John and herself to London .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 41]: They found the place so vast and noisy that it overwhelmed them ; but in the evening , after the ceremony at Abney Park , they strolled out from their hotel near King 's Cross Station to see the sights .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 28]: Not knowing whither they were drifting , they found themselves , an hour later , gazing at St. Paul 's Cathedral from the foot of Ludgate Hill .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 14]: They were walking toward the stately edifice , when a terrible thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 22]: A young woman fell , or threw herself , from a fourth-floor window onto the pavement of St. Martin 's Court .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 13]: In her arms was an infant , a boy twelve months old .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 12]: Providence saved him from the instant death met by his mother .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 27]: A projecting signboard caught his clothing , tore him from the encircling arms , and held him a precarious second until the rent frock gave way .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 14]: But John Bolland 's sharp eyes had noted the child 's momentary escape .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 12]: He sprang forward and caught the tiny body as it dropped .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 24]: At that hour , nearly nine o'clock , the court was deserted , and Ludgate Hill had lost much of its daily crowd .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 34]: Of course , a number of passers-by gathered ; and a policeman took the names and address of the farmer and his wife , they being the only actual witnesses of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 10]: But what was to be done with the baby ?
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 60]: Mrs. Bolland volunteered to take care of it for the night , and the policeman was glad enough to leave it with her when he ascertained that no one in the house from which the woman fell knew anything about her save that she was a `` Mrs. Martineau , '' and rented a furnished room beneath the attic .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 10]: The inquest detained the Bollands another day in town .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 12]: Police inquiries showed that the unfortunate young woman had committed suicide .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 23]: A letter , stuck to a dressing-table with a hatpin , stated her intention , and that her name was not Martineau .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 9]: Would the lady like to see the letter ?
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 8]: `` Oh , dear , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 5]: said the baroness hastily .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 21]: `` Your story is awfully interesting , but I could not bear to read the poor creature 's words . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: Well , the rest was obvious .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 11]: Mrs. Bolland was childless after twenty years of married life .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 15]: She begged for the bairn , and her husband allowed her to adopt it .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 25]: They gave the boy their own name , but christened him after the scene of his mother 's death and his own miraculous escape .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 36]: And there he was now , coming up the village street , leading Ang√®le confidently by the hand -- a fine , intelligent lad , and wholly different from every other boy in the village .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 24]: Not even the squire 's sons equaled him in any respect , and the teacher of the village school gave him special lessons .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 10]: Perhaps the lady had noticed the way he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 22]: The teacher was proud of Martin 's abilities , and he tried to please her by not using the Yorkshire dialect .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 12]: `` Ah , I see , '' said the baroness quietly .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 7]: `` His history is quite romantic .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 19]: But what will he become when he grows up -- a farmer , like his adopted father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 18]: `` John thinks te mak ' him a minister , '' said Mrs. Bolland with genial pride .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 4]: `` A minister !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 11]: Do you mean a preacher , a Nonconformist person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 7]: `` Why , yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 12]: John would n't hear of his bein ' a parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 4]: `` Grand Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 3]: Quelle b√™tise !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 25]: Of course , you will do what is best for him ... Well , ma belle , have you enjoyed your little walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: `` Oh , so much , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 19]: The miller has such lovely pigs , so fat , so tight that you ca n't pinch them .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 12]: And there 's a beautiful dog , with four puppy dogs .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 8]: I 'm so glad we came here .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 6]: J'en suis bien aise . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 26]: `` She 's a queer little girl , '' said Mrs. Bolland , as Martin and she watched the party walking back to The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 11]: `` I could n't tell half what she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 9]: `` No , mother , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 23]: `` She goes off into French without thinking , and her mother 's a German baroness , who married an English officer .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 8]: The nurse does n't speak any English .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 8]: I wish I knew French and German .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 7]: French , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 33]: CHAPTER III THE SEEDS OF MISCHIEF Preparations for the forthcoming `` Feast '' were varied by gossip concerning `` the baroness , '' her daughter , and the Normandy _ bonne _ .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 17]: Elmsdale had never before set eyes on any human beings quite so foreign to its environment .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 16]: At first , the canny Yorkshire folk were much intrigued by the lady 's title .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 58]: A princess or a duchess they had read of ; a marchioness and a countess they had seen , because the county of broad acres finds room for a great many noble houses ; and baronets ' wives , each a `` Lady '' by perspective right , were so plentiful as to arouse no special comment .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 23]: But a `` baroness '' was rather un-English , while Elmsdale frankly refused to pronounce her name other than `` Eedelsteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 56]: The village was ready to allude to her as `` her ladyship , '' but was still doubtful whether or not to grant her the prefix `` Lady , '' when the question was settled in a wholly unexpected way by the announcement that the baroness preferred to be addressed as `` Mrs. Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 17]: In fact , she was rather annoyed that Ang√®le should have flaunted the title at all .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 19]: `` I am English by marriage , and proud of my husband 's name , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 31]: `` He was a gallant officer , who fell in the Boer War , and I have long since left the use of my German rank for purely official occasions .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 17]: It is no secret , of course , but Ang√®le should not have mentioned it . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 6]: Elmsdale liked this democratic utterance .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 57]: It made these blunt Yorkshire folk far readier to address her as `` your ladyship '' than would have been the case otherwise , and , truth to tell , she never chided them for any lapse of the sort , though , in accordance with her wish , she became generally known as Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 20]: She rented a suite at The Elms , a once pretentious country mansion owned by a family named Walker .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 32]: The males had died , the revenues had dwindled , and two elderly maiden ladies , after taking counsel with the vicar , had advertised their house in a society newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 8]: Mrs. Saumarez said she was an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 7]: She required rest and good air .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 22]: Fran√ßoise , since Ang√®le had outgrown the attentions of a nurse , was employed mainly as her mistress 's confidential servant .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 37]: Fran√ßoise either could not or would not speak English ; Mrs. Saumarez gave excellent references and no information as to her past , while Ang√®le 's volatile reminiscences of continental society had no meaning for Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 11]: But it was abundantly clear that Mrs. Saumarez was rich .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 36]: She swept aside the arrangements made by the Misses Walker for her comfort , chose her own set of apartments , ordered things wholly her own way , and paid double the terms originally demanded .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 35]: The day following her visit to the White House she descended on the chief grocer , whose shop was an emporium of many articles outside his trade , but mostly of a cheap order .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 24]: `` Mr. Webster , '' she said in her grand manner , `` few of the goods you stock will meet my requirements .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 15]: I prefer to deal with local tradesmen , but they must meet my wants .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 31]: Now , if you are prepared to cater for me , you will not only save me the trouble of ordering supplies from London , but make some extra profit .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 18]: You have proper agents , no doubt , so you must obtain everything of the best quality .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 3]: You understand .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 21]: I shall never grumble at the prices ; but the least inferiority will lead me to withdraw my custom . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 18]: It was a sore point with Mr. Webster that `` the squire '' dealt with the Stores .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 30]: He promised implicit obedience , and wrote such instructions to Leeds , his supply town , that the wholesale house there wondered who had come to live at Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 46]: The proprietress of the `` Black Lion , '' hearing the golden tales that circulated through the village , dressed in her best one afternoon and called at The Elms in the hope of obtaining patronage for wines , bottled beer , and mineral waters .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 5]: Mrs. Saumarez was resting .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 12]: The elder Miss Walker conveyed Mrs. Atkinson 's name and business .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 31]: Some conversation took place between Mrs. Saumarez and Fran√ßoise , with the result that Mrs. Atkinson was instructed to supply Schweppe 's soda water , but `` no intoxicants . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 7]: So Mrs. Saumarez was a teetotaller .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 27]: The secretary of the local branch of the Good Templars donned a faded black coat and a rusty tall hat and sent in a subscription list .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 7]: It came out with a guinea .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 9]: The vicar was at The Elms next day .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 24]: Mrs. Saumarez received him graciously and gave him a five-pound note toward the funds of the bazaar which would be opened next week .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 8]: Most decidedly the lady was an acquisition .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 48]: When Miss Martha Walker was enjoined by her sister , Miss Emmy , to find out how long Mrs. Saumarez intended to remain at Elmsdale -- on the plausible pretext that the terms would be lowered for a monthly tenancy -- she was given a curt reply .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 8]: `` I am a creature of moods .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 10]: I may be here a day , a year .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 7]: At present the place suits me .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 8]: And Ang√®le is brimming over with health .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 16]: But it is fatal if I am told I must remain a precise period anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 10]: That is why I never go to Carlsbad . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 28]: Miss Martha did not understand the reference to Carlsbad ; but the nature of the reply stopped effectually all further curiosity as to Mrs. Saumarez 's plans .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 6]: It also insured unflagging service .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 15]: Hardly a day passed that the newcomer did not call at the White House .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 29]: She astounded John Bolland by the accuracy of her knowledge concerning stock , and annoyed him , too , by remarking that some of his land required draining .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 12]: `` Your lower pastures are too rank , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 26]: `` So long as there is a succession of fine seasons it does not matter , but a wet spring and summer will trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 17]: You will have fifty acres of water-sodden meadows , and nothing breeds disease more quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 31]: `` None o ' my cattle hev had a day 's illness , short o ' bein ' a trifle overfed wi ' oil cake , '' he said testily .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 4]: `` Quite so .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 14]: You told me that in former years you raised wheat and oats there .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 7]: I 'm talking about grass . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: Martin and Ang√®le became close friends .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 33]: The only children of the girl 's social rank in the neighborhood were the vicar 's daughter , Elsie Herbert , and the squire 's two sons , Frank and Ernest Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 6]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe was a widower .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 21]: He lived at the Hall , three-quarters of a mile away , and had not as yet met Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 9]: Ang√®le would have nothing to do with Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 13]: `` I do n't like her , '' she confided to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 13]: `` She does n't care for boys , and I adore them .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 8]: She 's trop regl√©e for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 11]: `` Well , she holds her nose -- so . ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 10]: Ang√®le tilted her head and cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 23]: `` Of course , I do n't know her , but she seems to be a nice girl , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 17]: `` Why do you say , ` Of course , I do n't know her ' ?
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: She lives here , does n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 10]: `` Yes , but my father is a farmer .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 13]: She has a governess , and goes to tea at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: I 've met her driving from the Castle .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 9]: She 's above me , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 4]: Ang√®le laughed maliciously .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 5]: `` O l√† l√† !
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 4]: c'est pour rire !
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 4]: I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: She is -- what do you say -- a little snob . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' protested Martin .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 14]: `` I think she would be very nice , if I knew her .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: You 'll like her fine when you play with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 3]: `` Me !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: Play with her , so prim , so pious .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 5]: I prefer Jim Bates .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 7]: He winked at me yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 4]: `` Did he ?
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 16]: Next time I see him I 'll make it hard for him to wink . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 7]: Ang√®le clapped her hands and pirouetted .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: `` What , '' she cried , `` you will fight him , and for me !
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 3]: What joy !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 8]: It 's just like a story book .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: You must kick him , so , and he will fall down , and I will kiss you . ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 13]: `` I will not kick him , '' said the indignant Martin .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 8]: `` Boys do n't kick in England .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 10]: And I do n't want to be kissed . ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 9]: `` Do n't boys kiss in England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 10]: `` Well ... anyhow , I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 7]: `` Then we are not sweethearts .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 16]: I sha n't kiss you , and you must just leave Jim Bates alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 4]: Martin was humiliated .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 10]: He remained silent and angry during the next minute .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 30]: By a quick turn in the conversation Ang√®le had placed him in a position of rivalry with another boy , one with whom she had not exchanged a word .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 26]: `` Look here , '' he said , after taking thought , `` if I kiss your cheek , may I lick Jim Bates ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 8]: This magnanimous offer was received with derision .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 8]: `` I forbid you to do either .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 11]: If you do , I 'll tell your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 45]: The child had discovered already the fear with which Martin regarded the stern , uncompromising Methodist yeoman -- a fear , almost a resentment , due to Bolland 's injudicious attempts to guide a mere boy into the path of serious and precise religion .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 19]: Never had Martin found the daily reading of Scripture such a burden as during the past few days .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 33]: The preparations for the feast , the cricket-playing , running and jumping of the boys practicing for prizes -- these disturbing influences interfered sadly with the record of David 's declining years .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 36]: Even now , with Ang√®le 's sarcastic laughter ringing in his ears , he was compelled to leave her and hurry to the front kitchen , where the farmer was waiting with the Bible opened .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: At the back door he paused and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 6]: She blew him a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 5]: `` Good boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 8]: `` Mind you learn your lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 10]: `` And mind you keep away from those cowsheds .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 8]: Your nurse ought to have been here .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 6]: It 's tea time . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 8]: `` I do n't want any tea .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 8]: I 'm going to smell the milk .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 8]: I love the smell of a farmyard .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 4]: Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: But , there !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: You have never smelt anything else .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 7]: Every place has its own smell .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 6]: Paris smells like smoky wood .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 5]: London smells of beer .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 14]: Here there is always the smell of cows ... '' `` Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 33]: called a harsh voice from the interior , and the boy perforce brought his wandering wits to bear on the wrongdoing of David in taking a census of the people of Israel .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 35]: He read steadily through the chapter which described how a pestilence swept from Dan to Beersheba and destroyed seventy thousand men , all because David wished to know how many troops he could muster .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 13]: He could hear Ang√®le talking to the maids and making them laugh .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 21]: A caravan lumbered through the street ; he caught a glimpse of carved wooden horses ' heads and gilded moldings .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 25]: His quick and retentive brain mastered the words of the chapter , but to-day there was no mysterious and soul-awakening glimpse of its spirit .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 19]: `` What did David say te t ' Lord when t ' angel smote t ' people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 11]: said Bolland when the moment came to question his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 20]: `` He said , ` Lo , I have sinned ; but what have these sheep done ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 9]: `` And what sin had he de√§n ? ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 10]: I think the whole thing was jolly unfair . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 20]: John Bolland laid down the Bible and rested both hands on the arms of the chair to steady himself .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 5]: Had he heard aright ?
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 10]: Was the boy daring to criticize the written word ?
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 13]: But Martin 's brain raced ahead of the farmer 's slow-rising wrath .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 12]: He trembled at the abyss into which he had almost fallen .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 24]: What horror if he lost an hour on this Saturday , the Saturday before the Feast , of all days in the year !
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 50]: `` I did n't quite mean that , '' he said , `` but it does n't say why it was wrong for a census to be taken , and it does say that when the angel stretched his hand over Jerusalem the Lord repented of the evil . ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: Bolland bent again over the book .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 6]: Yes , Martin was right .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 5]: He was letter perfect .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 13]: `` It says nowt about unfairness , '' growled the man slowly .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 6]: That was my mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 13]: `` Ye mun tak ' heed age√§n miste√§ks o ' that sort .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: On Monday we begin t ' Third Book o ' Kings . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 16]: So , not even the Feast would be allowed to interfere with the daily lesson .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 8]: Ang√®le had departed with the belated Fran√ßoise .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 19]: Martin , running through the orchard like a hare , doubled to the main road along the lane .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 20]: In two minutes he was watching the unloading of the roundabout in front of the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 5]: Jim Bates was there .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: `` Here , I want you , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 9]: `` You winked at Ang√®le Saumarez yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 6]: `` Winked at whe√§ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 3]: demanded Jim .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 12]: `` At the young lady who lives at The Elms . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 11]: `` Not afore she pulled a fe√§ce at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 15]: `` Well , if you wink at her again I 'll lick you . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 4]: `` Mebbe . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 10]: `` There 's no ` mebbe ' about it .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 19]: Come down to the other end of the green now , if you think I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 31]: Jim Bates was no coward , but he was faced with the alternative of yielding gracefully and watching the showmen at work or risking a defeat in a needless battle .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 8]: He chose the better part of valor .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 13]: `` It 's ne√§n o ' my business , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 15]: `` I de√§n ' t want te wink at t ' young leddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 19]: At the inn door Mrs. Atkinson 's three little girls were standing with Kitty Thwaites , the housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 19]: The eldest , a bonnie child , whose fair skin was covered with freckles , ran toward Martin .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 11]: `` Where hae ye bin all t ' week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 11]: `` Are ye always wi ' that Saumarez girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 12]: `` I heerd tell she was at your ple√§ce all hours .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 19]: What beautiful frocks she has , but I should be ashe√§med te show me legs like her . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 13]: `` That 's the way she dresses , '' said Martin curtly .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: `` How funny .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 7]: Is she fond of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 7]: `` How do I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: He tried to edge away .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 5]: Evelyn tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 5]: Why should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: `` There 's no reason that I can tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 7]: `` You soon forget yer friends .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 15]: On ' y last Whit Monday ye bowt me a packet of chocolates . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 6]: There was truth in this .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 5]: Martin quitted her sheepishly .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 33]: He drew near some men , one of whom was Fred , the groom , and Fred had been drinking , as a preliminary to the deeper potations of the coming week .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 8]: `` Ay , there she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 10]: he muttered , with an angry leer at Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 17]: `` She thinks what 's good eneuf fer t ' sister is good eneuf fer her .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 4]: We 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 18]: Oad John Bollan ' sent ` im away wiv a flea i ' t ' lug a-Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 20]: I reckon he 'll hev one i ' t ' other ear if ' e comes after Kitty . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: One of the men grinned contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 5]: `` Gan away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 28]: `` George Pickerin ' ` ud chuck you ower t ' top o ' t ' hotel if ye said ` Booh ' to ` im . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: But Fred , too , grinned , blinking like an owl in daylight .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 35]: `` Them as lives t ' longest sees t ' me√§st , '' he muttered , and walked toward the stables , passing close to Kitty , who looked through him without seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 9]: Suddenly there was a stir among the loiterers .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 11]: Mrs. Saumarez was walking through the village with Mr. Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 12]: Behind the pair came the squire 's two sons and Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 47]: The great man had called on the new visitor to Elmsdale , and together they strolled forth , while he explained the festivities of the coming week , and told the lady that these `` feasts '' were the creation of an act of Charles II .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 10]: as a protest against the Puritanism of the Commonwealth .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 9]: Martin stood at the side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 11]: Mrs. Saumarez did not notice him , but Ang√®le did .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 25]: She lifted her chin and dropped her eyelids in clever burlesque of Elsie Herbert , the vicar 's daughter , but ignored him otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 19]: Martin was hurt , though he hardly expected to be spoken to in the presence of distinguished company .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: But he could not help looking after the party .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 7]: Ang√®le turned and caught his glance .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 6]: She put out her tongue .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 29]: He heard a mocking laugh and knew that Evelyn Atkinson was telling her sisters of the incident , whereupon he dug his hands in his pockets and whistled .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 21]: A shooting gallery was in process of erection , and its glories soon dispelled the gloom of Ang√®le 's snub .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 27]: The long tube was supported on stays , the target put in place , the gaudy front pieced together , and half a dozen rifles unpacked .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 24]: The proprietor meant to earn a few honest pennies that night , and some of the men were persuaded to try their prowess .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 6]: Martin was a born sportsman .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 18]: He watched the competitors so keenly that Ang√®le returned with her youthful cavaliers without attracting his attention .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 36]: Worse than that , Evelyn Atkinson , scenting the possibility of rustic intrigue , caught Martin 's elbow and asked quite innocently why a bell rang if the shooter hit the bull 's - eye .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 41]: Proud of his knowledge , he explained that there was a hole in the iron plate , and that no bell , but a sheet of copper , was suspended in the box at the back where the lamp was .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 9]: Both Ang√®le and Evelyn appreciated the situation exactly .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 10]: The boy alone was ignorant of their tacit rivalry .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: Ang√®le pointed out Martin to the Beckett-Smythes .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: `` He is such a nice boy , '' she said sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 7]: `` I see him every day .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 10]: He can fight any boy in the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 8]: `` Hum , '' said the heir .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 7]: `` How old is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 4]: `` Fourteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 6]: `` I am fifteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 6]: Ang√®le smiled like a seraph .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 5]: `` Regardez-vous donc ! ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 19]: `` He could twiddle you round -- so , '' and she spun one hand over the other .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 14]: `` I 'd like to see him try , '' snorted the aristocrat .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 28]: The opportunity offered itself sooner than he expected , but the purring of a high-powered car coming through the village street caused the pedestrians to draw aside .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 20]: The car , a new and expensive one , was driven by a chauffeur , but held no passengers .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe gazed after it reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 17]: `` Well , I thought I knew every car in this district , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 13]: `` It is mine , I expect , '' announced Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 12]: `` I 've ordered one , and it should arrive to-day .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 10]: I need an automobile for an occasional long run .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 15]: For pottering about the village lanes , I may buy a pony cart . ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 8]: `` What make is your car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 4]: inquired the Squire .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 4]: `` A Mercedes .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 14]: I 'm told it is by far the best at the price . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 30]: `` It 's the best German car , of course , but I can hardly admit that it equals the French , or even our own leading types . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 12]: `` Oh , I do n't profess to understand these things .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 13]: I only know that my banker advised me to buy none other .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 7]: He explained the matter simply enough .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 21]: The German manufacturers want to get into the trade and are content to lose money for a year or so .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: You know how pushful they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 6]: Beckett-Smythe saw the point clearly .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 12]: He was even then hesitating between a Panhard and an Austin .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 15]: He decided to wait a little longer and ascertain the facts about the Mercedes .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 7]: A month later he purchased one .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 30]: Mrs. Saumarez 's chauffeur , a smart young mechanic from Bremen , who spoke English fluently , demonstrated that the buyer was given more than his money 's worth .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 17]: The amiable Briton wondered how such things could be , but was content to benefit personally .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 9]: He , in time , spread the story .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 13]: German cars enjoyed a year 's boomlet in that part of Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: With nearly every car came a smart young chauffeur mechanic .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 7]: Surely , this was wisdom personified .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 26]: They knew the engine , could effect nearly all road repairs , demanded less wages than English drivers , and were always civil and reliable .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 8]: `` Go-ahead people , these Germans ! ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 5]: was the general verdict .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 18]: CHAPTER IV THE FEAST An Elmsdale Sunday was a day of rest for man and beast alike .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 23]: There could be no manner of doubt that the horses and dogs were able to distinguish the Sabbath from the workaday week .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 55]: Prince , six-year-old Cleveland bay , the strongest and tallest horse in the stable , when his headstall was taken off on Sunday morning , showed his canny Yorkshire sense by walking past the row of carts and pushing open a rickety gate that led to a tiny meadow kept expressly for odd grazing .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 40]: After him , in Indian file , went five other horses ; yet , on any other day in the week they would stand patiently in the big yard , waiting to be led away singly or in pairs .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 62]: Curly and Jim , the two sheep-dogs -- who never failed between Monday and Saturday to yawn and stretch expectantly by the side of John Bolland 's sturdy nag in the small yard near the house -- on the seventh day made their way to the foreman 's cottage , there attending his leisure for a scamper over the breezy moorland .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 11]: For , Sunday or weekday , sheep must be counted .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 30]: If any are missing , the almost preternatural intelligence of the collie is invoked to discover the hollow in which the lost ones are reposing helplessly on their backs .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 15]: They will die in a few hours if not placed on their legs again .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 7]: Turn over unaided they can not .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 10]: Man or dog must help , or they choke .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 49]: Even the cocks and hens , the waddling geese and ducks , the huge shorthorns , which are the pride of the village , seemed to grasp the subtle distinction between life on a quiet day and the well-filled existence of the six days that had gone before .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 31]: At least , Martin thought so ; but he did not know then that the windows of the soul let in imageries that depend more on mood than on reality .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: Personally he hated Sunday , or fancied he did .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 20]: He had Sunday clothes , Sunday boots , Sunday food , a Sunday face , and a Sunday conscience .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 15]: Things were wrong on Sunday that were right during the rest of the week .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 37]: Though the sky was as bright , the grass as green , the birds as tuneful on that day as on others , he was supposed to undergo a metamorphosis throughout all the weary waking hours .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 11]: His troubles often began the moment he quitted his bed .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 23]: As his `` best '' clothes and boots were so little worn , they naturally maintained a spick-and-span appearance during many months .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 36]: Hence , he was given a fresh assortment about once a year , and the outfit possessed three distinct periods of use , of which the first tortured his mind and the third his body .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 30]: He being a growing lad , the coat was made too long in the sleeves , the trousers too long in the legs , and the boots too large .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 12]: At the beginning of this epoch he looked and felt ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 30]: Gradually , the effect of roast beef and suet dumplings brought about a better fit , and during four months of the year he was fairly smart in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 7]: Then there came an ominous shrinkage .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 44]: His wrists dangled below the coat cuffs , there was an ever-widening rim of stocking between the tops of the boots and the trousers ' ends , while Mrs. Bolland began to grumble each week about the amount of darning his stockings required .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 46]: Moreover , there were certain quite insurmountable difficulties in the matter of buttons , and it was with a joy tempered only by fear of the grotesque that he beheld the `` best '' suit given away to an urchin several sizes smaller than himself .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 43]: Happily for his peace of mind , the Feast occurred in the middle stage of the current supply of raiment , so he was as presentable as a peripatetic tailor who worked in the house a fortnight at Christmas could make him .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 6]: But this Sunday dragged terribly .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 64]: The routine of chapel from 10:30 A.M. to noon , Sunday-school from 3 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. , and chapel again from 6:30 P.M. to 8 P.M. , was inevitable , but there were compensations in the whispered confidences of Jim Bates and Tommy Beadlam , the latter nicknamed `` White Head , '' as to the nature of some of the shows .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 19]: The new conditions brought into his life by Ang√®le Saumarez troubled him far more than he could measure .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 14]: Her mere presence in the secluded village carried a breath of the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 24]: Her talk was of London and Paris , of parks , theatres , casinos , luxurious automobiles , deck-cabins , and Pullman cars .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 12]: She seemed to have lived so long and seen so much .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 6]: Yet she knew very little .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 20]: Her ceaseless chatter in French and English , which sounded so smart at first , would not endure examination .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 5]: She had read nothing .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 65]: When Martin spoke of `` Robinson Crusoe '' and `` Ivanhoe , '' of `` Treasure Island '' and `` The Last of the Mohicans '' -- a literary medley devoured for incident and not for style -- she had not even heard of them , but produced for inspection an astonishingly rude colored cartoon , the French comments on which she translated literally .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 54]: He was a boy aglow with dim but fervent ideals ; she , a girl who had evidently been allowed to grow up almost wild in the midst of fashionable life and flippant servants , all exigencies being fulfilled when she spoke nicely and cleverly and wore her clothes with the requisite chic .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 30]: The two were as opposed in essentials as an honest English apple grown in a wholesome garden and a rare orchid , the product of some poisonous equatorial swamp .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 14]: He tried to interest her in the sights and sounds of country life .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 17]: She met him more than halfway by putting embarrassing questions as to the habits of animals .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 57]: More than once he told her plainly that there were some things little girls ought not to know , whereat she laughed scornfully , but switched the conversation to a topic on which she could vex him , as was nearly always the case in her references to Elsie Herbert or John Bolland 's Bible teaching .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 16]: Yet he was restless and irritable because he did not see her on the Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 22]: Mrs. Saumarez , it is true , sped swiftly through the village about three o'clock , and again at half-past seven .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 35]: On each occasion the particular chapel affected by the Bollands was resounding with a loud-voiced hymn or echoing the vibrant tones of a preacher powerful beyond question in the matter of lungs and dogmatism .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 26]: The whir of the Mercedes shut off these sounds ; but Martin heard the passing of the car and knew that Ang√®le was in it .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 26]: It was a novel experience for the Misses Walker to find that their lodgers recognized no difference between Sunday and the rest of the week .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 42]: Mrs. Saumarez dined at 6:30 P.M. , a concession of an hour and a half to rural habits , but she scouted the suggestion that a cold meal should be served to enable the `` girls '' to go to church .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 13]: The old ladies dared not quarrel with one who paid so well .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 11]: They remained at home and cooked and served the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 47]: As Fran√ßoise , to a large extent , waited on her mistress , this development might not have been noticed had not Ang√®le 's quick eyes seen Miss Emmy Walker carrying a chicken and a dish of French beans to a small table in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 11]: She told her mother , and Mrs. Saumarez was annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 47]: She had informed Miss Martha that if the servants required a `` night out , '' the addition of another domestic to the household at her expense would give them a good deal more liberty , but this ridiculous `` Sunday-evening '' notion must stop forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 16]: `` It gets on my nerves , this British Sabbath , '' she exclaimed peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 16]: `` In London I entertain largely on a Sunday and have never had any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 23]: Do you mean to say I can not invite guests to dinner on Sunday merely to humor a cook or a housemaid ?
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 3]: Absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 5]: Miss Martha promised reform .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 14]: `` Let her have her way , '' she said to Miss Emmy .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 29]: `` Another servant will have nothing to do , and all the girls will grow lazy ; but we must keep Mrs. Saumarez as long as we can .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 25]: Oh , if she would only remain a year , we 'd be out of debt , with the house practically recarpeted throughout ! ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 9]: Unfortunately , Mrs. Saumarez 's nerves were upset .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 7]: She was snappy all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 12]: Fran√ßoise tried many expedients to soothe her mistress 's ruffled feelings .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 42]: She brought a bundle of illustrated papers , a parcel of books , the scores of a couple of operas , even a gorgeous assortment of patterns of the new autumn dress fabrics , but each and all failed to attract .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 11]: For some reason the preternaturally acute Ang√®le avoided her mother .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 12]: She seemed to be afraid of her when in this mood .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 45]: The Misses Walker , seeing the anxiety of the maid and the unwonted retreat of the child to bed at an early hour , were miserable at the thought that such a trivial matter should have given their wealthy tenant cause for dire offense .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 18]: So Sunday passed irksomely , and everyone was glad when the next morning dawned in bright cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 28]: From an early hour there was evidence in plenty that the Elmsdale Feast would be an unqualified success , though shorn of many of its ancient glories .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 30]: Time was when the village used to indulge in a week 's saturnalia , but the march of progress had affected rural Yorkshire even so long ago as 1906 .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 58]: The younger people could visit Leeds , York , Scarborough , or Whitby by Saturday afternoon `` trips '' -- special excursion trains run at cheap rates -- while `` week-ends '' in London were not unknown luxuries , and these frequent opportunities for change of scene and recreation had lessened the scope of the annual revels .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 51]: Still , the trading instinct kept alive the commercial side of the Feast ; the splendid hospitality of the north country asserted itself ; church and chapels seized the chance of reaching enlarged congregations , and a number of itinerant showmen regarded Elmsdale as a fixture in the yearly round .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 17]: So , on the Monday , every neighboring village and moorland hamlet poured in its quota .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 24]: The people came on foot from the railway station , distant nearly two miles , on horseback , in every sort of conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 12]: The roads were alive with cattle , sheep , and pigs .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 15]: The programme mapped out bore a general resemblance on each of the four days .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 16]: The morning was devoted to business , the afternoon and evening to religion or pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 8]: The proceedings opened with a horse fair .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 15]: An agent of the German Government snapped up every Cleveland bay offered for sale .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 18]: George Pickering , in sporting garb , and smoking a big cigar , was an early arrival .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 16]: He bid vainly for a couple of mares which he needed to complete his stud .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 6]: Germany wanted them more urgently .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 16]: A splendid mare , the property of John Bolland , was put up for auction .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 17]: The auctioneer read her pedigree , and proved its authenticity by reference to the Stud Book .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 7]: `` Is she in foal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 9]: asked Pickering , and a laugh went around .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 4]: Bolland scowled blackly .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 16]: If a look could have slain the younger man he would assuredly have fallen dead .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 13]: The bidding commenced at # 40 and rose rapidly to # 60 .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 6]: Then Pickering lost his temper .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 8]: The agent for Germany was too pertinacious .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 17]: `` Seventy , '' he shouted , though the bids hitherto had mounted by single sovereigns .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 8]: `` Seventy-one , '' said the agent .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 4]: `` Eighty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 3]: roared Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: `` Eighty-one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 4]: nodded the agent .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 31]: `` The reserve is off , '' interposed the auctioneer , and again the surrounding farmers guffawed , as the mare had already gone to twenty pounds beyond her value .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 8]: Pickering swallowed his rage with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 5]: He turned to Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 17]: `` That 's an offset for my hard words the other day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 10]: But the farmer thrust aside the proffered olive branch .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 13]: `` Once a fule , always a fule , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 17]: Pickering , though anything but a fool in business , took the ungracious remark pleasantly enough .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 15]: `` He ought to sing a rare hymn this afternoon , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 24]: `` I 've put a score of extra sovereigns in his pocket , and he does n't even say ` Thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 10]: Well , it 's the way of the world .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 5]: Who 's dry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 12]: This invitation caused an adjournment to the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 6]: The auctioneer knew his clients .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 12]: Pickering 's allusion to the hymn was not made without knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 41]: At three o'clock , on a part of the green farthest removed from the thronged stalls and the blare of a steam-driven organ , Bolland and a few other earnest spirits surrounded the stentorian preacher and held an open-air service .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 27]: They selected tunes which everybody knew and , as a result , soon attracted a crowd of older people , some of whom brought their children .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: Martin , of course , was in the gathering .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 27]: Meanwhile , along the line of booths , a couple of leather-lunged men were singing old-time ballads , dealing for the most part with sporting incidents .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 25]: They soon became the centers of two packed audiences , mainly young men and boys , but containing more than a sprinkling of girls .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 17]: The ditties were couched in `` broad Yorkshire '' -- sometimes too broad for modern taste .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 44]: Whenever a particularly crude stanza was bawled forth a chuckle would run through the audience , and coppers in plenty were forthcoming for printed copies of the song , which , however , usually fell short of the blunt phraseology of the original .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 11]: The raucous ballad singers took risks feared by the printer .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 24]: Mrs. Saumarez , leading Ang√®le by the hand , thought she would like to hear one of these rustic melodies , and halted .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 7]: Instantly the vendor changed his cue .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 10]: The lady might be the wife of a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 28]: Once he got fourteen days as a rogue and a vagabond at the instance of just such another interested spectator , who put the police in action .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 33]: Quickly surfeited by the only half-understood humor of a song describing the sale of a dead horse , she wandered on , and soon came across the preacher and his lay helpers .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 19]: To her surprise she saw John Bolland standing bareheaded in the front rank , and with him Martin .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 14]: She had never pictured the keen-eyed , crusty old farmer in this guise .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 4]: It amused her .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 9]: The minister began to offer up a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 26]: The men hid their faces in their hats , the women bowed reverently , and fervent ejaculations punctuated each pause in the preacher 's appeal .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: `` I do believe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 3]: `` Amen !
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 3]: Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 8]: `` Spare us , O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 10]: Mrs. Saumarez stared at the gathering with real wonderment .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 5]: `` C'est incroyable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 9]: `` What are they doing , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 16]: cried Ang√®le , trying to guess why Martin had buried his eyes in his cap .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: `` They are praying , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 7]: It reminds one of the Covenanters .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 7]: It really is very touching . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 7]: `` Who were the Covenanters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 18]: `` When you are older , ma belle , you will read of them in history . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 7]: That was Mrs. Saumarez 's way .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 28]: She treated her daughter 's education as a matter for governesses whom she did not employ and masters to whose control Ang√®le would probably never be entrusted .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 7]: The two entered the White House .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 51]: There they found Mrs. Bolland , radiant in a black silk dress , a bonnet trimmed with huge roses , and a velvet dolman , the wings of which were thrown back over her portly shoulders to permit her the better to press all comers to partake of her hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 22]: Several women and one or two men were seated at the big table , while people were coming and going constantly .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 16]: It flustered and gratified Mrs. Bolland not a little to receive such a distinguished visitor .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 18]: `` Eh , my leddy , '' she cried , `` I 'm glad to see ye .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 6]: Will ye tek a chair ?
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 8]: And t ' young leddy , too ?
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: Will ye hev a glass o ' wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 6]: This was the recognized formula .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 22]: There was a decanter of port wine on the sideboard , but most of the visitors partook of tea or beer .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 16]: One of the men drew himself a foaming tankard from a barrel in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 5]: Mrs. Saumarez smiled wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 19]: `` No wine , thank you , '' she said ; `` but that beer looks very nice .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 10]: I 'll have some , if I may . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 16]: Not until that moment did Mrs. Bolland remember that her guest was a reputed teetotaller .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 18]: So , then , Mrs. Atkinson , proprietress of the `` Black Lion , '' was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 17]: `` That ye may , an ' welcome , '' she said in her hearty way .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 37]: Ang√®le murmured something in French , but her mother gave a curt answer , and the child subsided , being , perhaps , interested by the evident amazement and admiration she evoked among the country people .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 28]: To-day , Ang√®le was dressed in a painted muslin , with hat and sash of the same material , long black silk stockings , and patent-leather shoes .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 22]: She looked elegantly old-fashioned , and might have walked bodily out of one of Caran d'Ache 's sketches of French society .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 9]: Suddenly she bounced up like an india-rubber ball .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 5]: `` Tra la ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 7]: `` V'l√† mon cher Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 19]: The prayer meeting had ended , and Martin was speeding home , well knowing who had arrived there .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 6]: Ang√®le ran to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 19]: `` She 's a rale fairy , '' whispered Mrs. Summersgill , mistress of the Dale End Farm .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 11]: `` She 's rigged out like a pet doll . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: `` Ay , '' agreed her neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 9]: `` D'ye ken wheer they coom frae ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 7]: `` Frae Lunnon , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 10]: They 're staying wi ' t ' Miss Walkers .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 24]: That 's t ' muther , a Mrs. Saumarez , they call her , but they say she 's a Jarman baroness . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 20]: `` Well , bless her heart , she hez a rare swallow for a gill o ' ale . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 5]: This was perfectly true .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 10]: The lady had emptied her glass with real gusto .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 20]: `` I was so hot and tired , '' she said , with an apologetic smile at her hostess .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 25]: `` Now , I can admire your wonderful store of good things to eat , '' and she focussed the display through gold-rimmed eyeglasses .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 15]: Truly , the broad kitchen table presented a spectacle that would kill a dyspeptic .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 79]: A cold sirloin , a portly ham , two pairs of chickens , three brace of grouse -- these solids were mere garnishings to dishes piled with currant cakes , currant loaves and plain bread cut and buttered , jam turnovers , open tarts of many varieties , `` fat rascals , '' Queen cakes , sponge cakes -- battalions and army corps of all the sweet and toothsome articles known to the culinary skill of the North .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 35]: `` I 'm feared , my leddy , they wo n't suit your taste , '' began Mrs. Bolland , but the other broke in eagerly : `` Oh , do n't say that !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 20]: They look so good , so wholesome , so different from the French cooking we weary of in town .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 34]: If I were not afraid of spoiling my dinner and earning a scolding from Fran√ßoise I would certainly ask for some of that cold beef and a slice of bread and butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 32]: `` Tek my advice , ma'am , an ' eat while ye 're in t ' humor , '' cried Mrs. Bolland , instantly helping her guest to the eatables named .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 14]: Mrs. Saumarez laughed delightedly and peeled off a pair of white kid gloves .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 14]: She ate a little of the meat and crumbled a slice of bread .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 8]: Mrs. Bolland refilled the glass with beer .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 11]: Then the lady made herself generally popular by asking questions .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: Did they use lard or butter in the pastry ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 9]: How was the sponge cake made so light ?
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: What a curious custom it was to put currants into plain dough ; she had never seen it done before .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 22]: Were the servants able to do these things , or had they to be taught by the mistress of the house ?
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 35]: She amused the women by telling of the airs and graces of London domestics , and evoked a feeling akin to horror by relating the items of the weekly bills in her town house .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 15]: `` Seven pund o ' be√§can for breakfast i ' t ' kitchen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Summersgill .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 11]: `` Whe√§ ivver heerd tell o ' sike waste ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 27]: `` Eh , ma'am , '' cried another , `` but ye mun addle yer money aisy t ' let 'em carry on that gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 51]: Martin , who found Ang√®le in her most charming mood -- unconsciously pleased , too , that her costume was not so _ outr√© _ as to run any risk of caustic comment by strangers -- came in and asked if he might take her along the row of stalls .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 35]: Mrs. Bolland had given him a shilling that morning , and he resolved magnanimously to let the shooting gallery wait ; Ang√®le should be treated to a shilling 's worth of aught she fancied .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 5]: But Mrs. Saumarez rose .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 20]: `` Your mother will kill me with kindness , Martin , if I remain longer , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 18]: `` Take me , too , and we 'll see if the fair contains any toys . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 36]: She emptied the second glass of ale , drew on her gloves , bade the company farewell with as much courtesy as if they were so many countesses , and walked away with the youngsters .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 24]: At one stall she bought Martin a pneumatic gun , a powerful toy which the dealer never expected to sell in that locality .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 32]: At another she would have purchased a doll for Ang√®le , but the child shrugged her shoulders and declared that she would greatly prefer to ride on the roundabouts with Martin .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 12]: Mrs. Saumarez agreed instantly , and the pair mounted the hobby-horses .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 14]: Among the children who watched them enviously were Jim Bates and Evelyn Atkinson .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 34]: When the steam organ was in full blast and the horses were flying round at a merry pace , Mrs. Saumarez bent over Jim Bates and placed half a sovereign in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 24]: `` Go to the ` Black Lion , ' '' she said , `` and bring me a bottle of the best brandy .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: See that it is wrapped in paper .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 18]: I do not care to go myself to a place where there are so many men . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 4]: Jim darted off .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: The roundabout slackened speed and stopped , but Mrs. Saumarez ordered another ride .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 12]: The whirl had begun again when Bates returned with a parcel .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 13]: `` It was four shillin 's , ma'am , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: `` Thank you , very much .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 5]: Keep the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 27]: Even Evelyn Atkinson was so awed by the magnitude of the tip that she forgot for a moment to glue her eyes on Ang√®le and Martin .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 45]: But Ang√®le , wildly elated though she was with the sensation of flight , and seated astride like a boy , until the tops of her stockings were exposed to view , did not fail to notice the conclusion of Jim Bates 's errand .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 15]: `` Mamma will be ill to-night , '' she screamed in Martin 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 9]: `` Fran√ßoise will be busy waiting on her .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 10]: I 'll come out again at eight o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 10]: `` You must not , '' shouted the boy .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 10]: `` It will be very rough here then . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 13]: `` C'la va -- I mean , I know that quite well .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 8]: It 'll be all the more jolly .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 6]: Meet me at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: I 'll bring plenty of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 9]: `` I ca n't , '' protested Martin .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 5]: `` You must ! ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 14]: `` But I 'm supposed to be home myself at eight o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 14]: `` If you do n't come , I 'll find some other boy .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 23]: Frank Beckett-Smythe said he would try and turn up every evening , in case I got a chance to sneak out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 6]: I 'll be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 14]: Martin intended to hurry her through the fair and take her home again .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 18]: If he received a `` hiding '' for being late , he would put up with it .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 22]: In any case , the squire 's eldest son could not be allowed to steal his wilful playmate without a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 14]: Probably Adam reasoned along similar lines when Eve first offered him an apple .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 28]: Be that as it may , it never occurred to Martin that the third chapter of Genesis could have the remotest bearing on the night 's frolic .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 28]: CHAPTER V `` IT IS THE FIRST STEP THAT COUNTS '' Mrs. Saumarez and Ang√®le returned to The Elms , but Martin had to forego accompanying them .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 28]: He knew that -- with Bible opened at the Third Book of Kings -- John Bolland was waiting in a bedroom , every downstairs apartment being crowded .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 24]: He ran all the way along the village street and darted upstairs , striving desperately to avoid even the semblance of undue haste .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 7]: Bolland was thumbing the book impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 6]: He frowned over his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: `` Why are ye late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Saumarez asked me to walk with her through the village , '' answered Martin truthfully .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 10]: T ' wife telt me she was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 10]: The explanation served , and Martin breathed more freely .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 28]: The reading commenced : `` Now king David was old and stricken in years ; and they covered him with clothes , but he gat no heat .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 53]: `` Wherefore his servants said unto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 42]: Martin , with his mind in a tumult on account of the threatened escapade , did not care a pin what method was adopted to restore the feeble circulation of the withered King so long as the lesson passed off satisfactorily .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 49]: With rare self-control , he bent over the , to him , unmeaning page , and acquitted himself so well in the parrot repetition which he knew would be pleasing that he ventured to say : `` May I stay out a little later to-night , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 4]: `` What for ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 20]: You 're better i ' bed than gapin ' at shows an ' listenin ' te drunken men . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 38]: `` I only ask because -- because I 'm told that Mrs. Saumarez 's little girl means to see the fair by night , and she -- er -- would like me to be with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 5]: John Bolland laughed dryly .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 16]: `` Mrs. Saumarez 'll soon hev more 'n eneuf o n't , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 18]: `` Ay , lad , ye can stay wi ' her , if that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 28]: Martin never , under any circumstances , told a downright lie , but he feared that this was sailing rather too near the wind to be honest .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 10]: The nature of Ang√®le 's statement was so nebulous .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 20]: He could hardly explain outright that Mrs. Saumarez was not coming -- that Ang√®le alone would be the sightseer .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 17]: So he flushed , and felt that he was obtaining the required permission by false pretense .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 33]: He could have pulled Ang√®le 's pretty ears for placing him in such a dilemma , but with a man so utterly unsympathetic as Bolland it was impossible to be quite candid .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 9]: He had clear ideas of right and wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 26]: He knew it was wrong for Ang√®le to come out unattended and mix in the scene of rowdyism which the village would present until midnight .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 37]: If she really could succeed in leaving The Elms unnoticed , the most effectual way to stop her was to go now to her mother or to one of the Misses Walker and report her intention .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 29]: But this , according to the boy 's code of honor , was to play the sneak , than which there is no worse crime in the calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 7]: He would look after her himself .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 20]: There was a spice of adventure , too , in acting as the chosen squire of this sprightly damsel .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 46]: Strong-minded as he was , and resolute beyond his years , Ang√®le 's wilfulness , her quick tongue , the diablerie of her glance , the witchery of her elegant little person , captivated heart and brain , and benumbed the inchoate murmurings of conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 34]: Oddly enough , he often found himself comparing her with Elsie Herbert , a girl with whom he had never exchanged a word , and Ang√®le Saumarez invariably figured badly in the comparison .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 33]: The boy did not know then that he must become a man , perhaps soured of life , bitter with experience , before he would understand the difference between respect and fascination .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 17]: With housewife prudence , Mrs. Bolland hailed him as he was passing through the back kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 21]: `` Noo , then , Martin , do n't ye go racketin ' about too much in your best clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 20]: And mind your straw hat is n't blown off if ye go on one o ' them whirligigs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 18]: `` All right , mother , '' he said cheerfully , and was gone in a flash .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 9]: Two hours must elapse before Ang√®le could appear .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 23]: Jim Bates , who bore no malice , stood treat in gingerbread and lemonade out of the largesse bestowed by Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 53]: Martin , carried away by sight of a champion boxer who offered a sovereign to any local man under twelve stone who stood up to him for three two-minute rounds , spent sixpence in securing seats for himself and Jim when the gage of combat was thrown down by his gamekeeper friend .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 9]: There was a furious fight with four-ounce gloves .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 12]: The showman discovered quickly that Velveteens `` knew a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 40]: Repeated attempts to `` out '' him with `` the right '' on the `` point '' resulted in heavy `` counters '' on the ribs , and a terrific uppercut failed because of the keeper 's quick sight .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 35]: The proprietor of the booth , who acted as timekeeper , gave every favor to his henchman , but at the end of the third round the professional was more blown than the amateur .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 21]: The sovereign was handed over with apparent good will , both showmen realizing that it might be money well spent .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 23]: And it was , as the black eyes and swollen lips among the would-be pugilists of Elmsdale testified for many days thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 15]: Martin , who had never before seen a real boxing match , was entranced .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 33]: With a troop of boys he accompanied the two combatants to the door of the `` Black Lion , '' where a fair proportion of the sovereign was soon converted into beer .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 7]: George Pickering had witnessed the contest .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 19]: Generous to a fault , he started a purse to be fought for in rounds inside the booth .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 35]: Wanting a pencil and paper , he ran upstairs to his room -- he had resolved to stay at the inn for a couple of nights -- and encountered Kitty Thwaites on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 36]: She carried a laden tray , so he slipped an arm around her waist , and she was powerless to prevent him from kissing her unless she dropped the tray or risked upsetting its contents .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 11]: She had no intention of doing either of these things .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 9]: `` Oh , go on , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: she cried , not averting her face too much .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: He whispered something .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: `` Not me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 3]: she giggled .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 17]: `` Besides , I wo n't have a minnit to spare till closin ' time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 5]: Pickering hugged her again .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 10]: She descended the stairs , laughing and very red .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: The boys heard something of the details of the proposed Elmsdale championship boxing competition .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 10]: Entries were pouring in , there being no fee .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 13]: George Pickering was appointed referee , and the professional named as judge .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 12]: The first round would be fought at 3 P.M. next day .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 18]: The time passed more quickly than Martin expected ; as for his money , it simply melted .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 19]: Tenpence out of the shilling had vanished before he realized how precious little remained wherewith to entertain Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 30]: She said she would have `` plenty of money , '' but he imagined that a walk through the fair and a ride on the roundabout would satisfy her .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: Not even at fourteen does the male understand the female of twelve .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 16]: A few minutes before eight he escaped from his companions and strolled toward The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 22]: The house was not like the suburban villa which stands in the center of a row and proudly styles itself Oakdene .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 32]: It was hidden in a cluster of lordly elms , and already the day was so far spent that the entrance gate was invisible save at a few yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 13]: The nearest railway station was situated two miles along this very road .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 41]: A number of slow-moving country people were sauntering to the station , where the north train was due at 9:05 P.M. Another train , that from the south , arrived at 9:20 , and would be the last that night .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 16]: A full moon was rising , but her glories were hidden by the distant hills .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 12]: There was no wind ; the weather was fine and settled .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: The Elmsdale Feast was lucky in its dates .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 14]: Martin waited near the gate and heard the church clock chime the hour .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 10]: Two boys on bicycles came flying toward the village .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 5]: They were the Beckett-Smythes .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 9]: They slackened pace as they neared The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 10]: `` Wonder if she 'll get out to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 6]: said Ernest , the younger .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 8]: `` There 's no use waiting here .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 11]: She said she 'd dodge out one evening for certain .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 23]: If she 's not in the village , we 'd better skip back before we 're missed , '' said the heir .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: `` Oh , that 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 23]: Pater thinks we 're in the grounds , and there wo n't be any bother if we show up at nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 4]: They rode on .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 9]: The quarter-hour chimed , and Martin became impatient .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 13]: `` She was humbugging me , as usual , '' he reflected .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 10]: `` Well , this time I 'm pleased . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 10]: An eager voice whispered : `` Hold the gate !
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 8]: It 'll rattle when I climb over .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 6]: They 've not heard me .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 8]: I crept here on the grass . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 13]: Ang√®le had changed her dress to a dark-blue serge and sailor hat .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 5]: This was decidedly thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 14]: In her day attire she must have attracted a great deal of notice .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 28]: Now , in the dark , neither the excellence of her clothing nor the elegance of her carriage would differentiate her too markedly from the village girls .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 13]: She was breathless with haste , but her tongue rattled on rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 7]: `` Mamma _ is _ ill .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 6]: I knew she would be .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 13]: I told Fran√ßoise I had a headache , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: Then I crept downstairs again .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 17]: Miss Walker nearly caught me , but she 's so upset that she never saw me .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 12]: As for Fritz , if I meet him -- poof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter with Mrs. Saumarez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 9]: `` Trop de cognac , mon ch√©ri . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 13]: `` It means a ` bit wobbly , my dear . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: `` Is her head bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 7]: It will be for a week .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 5]: But never mind mamma .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 13]: She 'll be all right , with Fran√ßoise to look after her .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 5]: You pay for everything .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 7]: There 's ten shillings in silver .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 14]: I have a sovereign in my stocking , if we want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 10]: They were hurrying toward the distant medley of sound .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 11]: Flaring naptha lamps gave the village street a Rembrandt effect .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 17]: Love-making couples , with arms entwined , were coming away from the glare of the booths .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 10]: Their forms cast long shadows on the white road .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: `` Ten shillings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 3]: gasped Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 10]: `` Whatever do we want with ten shillings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: `` To enjoy ourselves , you silly .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 9]: You ca n't have any fun without money .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 24]: Why , when mamma dines at the Savoy and takes a party to the theater afterwards , it costs her as many pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 11]: I know , because I 've seen the checks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 9]: `` That has nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 9]: We ca n't spend ten shillings here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 7]: `` Oh , ca n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 6]: You leave that to me .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 14]: Mais , voyez-vous , imb√©cile , are you going to be nasty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 8]: She halted and stamped an angry foot .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 17]: `` No , I 'm not ; but -- '' `` Then come on , stupid .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 8]: I 'm late as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: `` The stalls remain open until eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 3]: `` Magnifique !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 16]: What a row there 'll be if I have to knock to get in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 5]: Martin held his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 23]: He resolved privately that Ang√®le should be home at nine , at latest , if he dragged her thither by main force .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 5]: The affair promised difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 11]: She was so intractable that a serious quarrel would result .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 8]: Well , he could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 24]: Better a lasting break than the wild hubbub that would spring up if they both remained out till the heinous hour she contemplated .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 40]: In the village they encountered Jim Bates and Evelyn Atkinson , surrounded by seven or eight boys and girls , for Jim was disposing rapidly of his six shillings , and Evelyn bestowed favor on him for the nonce .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 3]: `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: here 's Martin , '' whooped Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 11]: `` I thowt ye 'd gone yam -LRB- home -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 12]: Where hev ye -- '' Jim 's eloquence died away abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 9]: He caught sight of Ang√®le and was abashed .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 4]: Not so Evelyn .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 14]: `` Martin 's been to fetch his sweetheart , '' she said maliciously .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 7]: Ang√®le simpered sufficiently to annoy Evelyn .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 5]: Then she laughed agreement .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 8]: And wo n't we have a time !
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 3]: Come on !
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 6]: Everybody have a ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 6]: She sprang toward the horses .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 4]: Martin alone followed .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 5]: `` Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 8]: `` Martin will pay for the lot .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 7]: He has heaps of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 6]: No second invitation was needed .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: Several times the whole party swung round with lively yelling .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 17]: From the roundabouts they went to the swings ; from the swings to the cocoanut shies .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 16]: Here they were joined by the Beckett-Smythes , who endeavored promptly to assume the leadership .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 9]: Martin 's blood was fired by the contest .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 17]: He was essentially a boy foredoomed to dominate his fellows , whether for good or evil .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 7]: He pitched restraint to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 50]: He could throw better than either of the young aristocrats ; he could shoot straighter at the galleries ; he could describe the heroic combat between the boxer and Velveteens ; he would swing Ang√®le higher than any , until they looked over the crossbar after each giddy swirl .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 28]: The Beckett-Smythes kept pace with him only in expenditure , Jim Bates being quickly drained , and even they wondered how long the village lad could last .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 7]: The ten shillings were soon dissipated .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 22]: `` I want that sovereign , '' he shouted , when Ang√®le and he were riding together again on the hobby-horses .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 10]: `` I told you so , '' she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 16]: She turned up her dress to extricate the money from a fold of her stocking .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 28]: The light flashed on her white skin , and Frank Beckett-Smythe , who rode behind with one of the Atkinson girls , wondered what she was doing .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 14]: She bent over Martin and whispered : `` There are _ two _ !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 6]: Keep the fun going ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 19]: The young spark in the rear thought that she was kissing Martin ; he was wild with jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 33]: At the next show -- that of a woman grossly fat , who allowed the gapers to pinch her leg at a penny a pinch -- he paid with his last half-crown .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 14]: When they went to refresh themselves on ginger-beer , Martin produced a sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 22]: The woman who owned the stall bit it , surveyed him suspiciously , and tried to swindle him in the change .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 4]: She failed badly .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 14]: `` Eleven bottles at twopence and eleven cakes at a penny make two-and-nine .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 13]: I want two more shillings , please , '' he said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: `` Be aff wid ye !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 7]: I gev ye seventeen and thruppence .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 22]: If ye thry anny uv yer tricks an me I 'll be afther askin ' where ye got the pound . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 15]: `` Give me two more shillings , or I 'll call the police . ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 9]: Mrs. Maguire was beaten ; she paid up .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 13]: The crowd left her , with cries of `` Irish Molly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 6]: `` Where 's Mick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 5]: and even coarser expressions .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 14]: Ang√®le screamed at her : `` Why do n't you stick to ginger-beer ?
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 5]: You 're muzzy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 17]: The taunt stung , and the old Irishwoman cursed her tormentor as a black-eyed little witch .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 18]: Ang√®le , seeing that Martin carried all before him , began straightway to flirt with the heir .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 33]: At first the defection was not noted , but when she elected to sit by Frank while they watched the acrobats the new swain took heart once more and squeezed her arm .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 20]: Evelyn Atkinson , who was in a smiling temper , felt that a crisis might be brought about now .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 6]: There was not much time .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 46]: It was nearly ten o'clock , and soon her mother would be storming at her for not having taken herself and her sisters to bed , though , in justice be it said , the girls could not possibly sleep until the house was cleared .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 9]: Ernest Beckett-Smythe was her cavalier at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 14]: `` We 've seen all there is te see , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 12]: `` Let 's go and have a dance in our yard .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 8]: Jim Bates can play a mouth-organ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: Ernest was a slow-witted youth .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 7]: `` Where 's the good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 8]: `` There 's more fun here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 14]: `` You try it , an ' see , '' she murmured coyly .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 5]: The suggestion caught on .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 24]: It was discussed while Martin and Jim Bates were driving a weight up a pole by striking a lever with a heavy hammer .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 12]: Anything in the shape of an athletic feat always attracted Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 4]: Ang√®le was delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: She scented a row .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: These village urchins were imps after her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 10]: `` Oh , let 's , '' she agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 7]: `` It 'll be a change .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 9]: I 'll show you the American two-step . ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 9]: Frank had his arm around her waist now .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 4]: `` Right-o ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 11]: `` Evelyn , you and Ernest lead the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 19]: The girl , flattered by being bracketed publicly with one of the squire 's sons , enjoined caution .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 17]: `` Once we 're past t ' stables it 's all right , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 13]: `` I do n't suppose Fred 'll hear us , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 60]: Fred was at the front of the hotel watching the road , watching Kitty Thwaites as she flitted upstairs and down , watching George Pickering through the bar window , and grinning like a fiend when he saw that somewhat ardent wooer , hilarious now , but sober enough according to his standard , glancing occasionally at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 11]: There was a gate on each side of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 47]: That on the left led to the yard , with its row of stables and cart-sheds , and thence to a spacious area occupied by hay-stacks , piles of firewood , hen-houses , and all the miscellaneous lumber of an establishment half inn , half farm .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 12]: The gate on the right opened into a bowling-green and skittle-alley .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 9]: Behind these lay the kitchen garden and orchard .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 24]: A hedge separated one section from the other , and entrance could be obtained to either from the back door of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 25]: The radiance of a full moon now decked the earth in silver and black ; in the shade the darkness was intense by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 6]: The church clock struck ten .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: Half a dozen youngsters crept silently into the stable yard .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 20]: Ang√®le kicked up a dainty foot in a preliminary _ pas seul _ , but Evelyn stopped her unceremoniously .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 17]: The village girl 's sharp ears had caught footsteps on the garden path beyond the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 13]: It was George Pickering , with his arm around Kitty 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 14]: He was talking in a low tone , and she was giggling nervously .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 11]: `` They 're sweetheartin ' , '' whispered a girl .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 10]: `` So are we , '' declared Frank Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 8]: `` Are n't we , Ang√®le ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 3]: `` Sapristi !
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 5]: I should think so .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 5]: Where 's Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 7]: We do n't want him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 8]: `` Oh , he will be furious .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 4]: Let 's hide .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 22]: There will be such a row when he goes home , and he dare n't go till he finds me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 22]: Master Beckett-Smythe experienced a second 's twinge at thought of the greeting he and his brother would receive at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 12]: But here was Ang√®le pretending timidity and cowering in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 13]: He would not leave her now were he to be flayed alive .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 9]: The footsteps of Pickering and Kitty died away .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 7]: They had gone into the orchard .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 6]: Evelyn Atkinson breathed freely again .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 17]: `` Even if Kitty sees us now , I do n't care , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 19]: `` She dare n't tell mother , when she knows that we saw her and Mr. Pickerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 9]: He ought to have married her sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 4]: `` Poof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 3]: tittered Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 7]: `` Who heeds a domestic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 21]: Someone came at a fast run into the yard , running in desperate haste , and making a fearful din .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 4]: Two boys appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 7]: The leader shouted : `` Ang√®le !
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 2]: Ang√®le !
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 5]: Are you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 5]: Martin had missed her .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 26]: Jim Bates , who knew the chosen rendezvous of the Atkinson girls , suggested that they and their friends had probably gone to the haggarth .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 8]: `` Shut up , you fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 3]: hissed Frank .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 14]: `` Do you want the whole village to know where we are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: Martin ignored him .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 10]: He darted forward and caught Ang√®le by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 23]: He distinguished her readily by her outline , though she and the rest were hidden in the somber shadows of the outbuildings .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 8]: `` Why did you leave me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 4]: he demanded angrily .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 8]: `` You must come home at once .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 7]: It is past ten o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 12]: `` Do n't be angry , Martin , '' she pouted .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 11]: `` I am just a little tired of the noise .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: I want to show you and the rest a new dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 8]: The minx was playing her part well .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 8]: She had read Evelyn Atkinson 's soul .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 11]: She felt every throb of young Beckett-Smythe 's foolish heart .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 14]: She was quite certain that Martin would find her and cause a scene .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 17]: There was deeper intrigue afoot now than the mere folly of unlicensed frolic in the fair .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 17]: Her vanity , too , was gratified by the leading r√¥le she filled among them all .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: The puppets bore themselves according to their temperaments .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 22]: Evelyn bit her lip with rage and nearly yielded to a wild impulse to spring at Ang√®le and scratch her face .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 6]: Martin was white with determination .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 10]: As for Master Frank , he boiled over instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 15]: `` You just leave her alone , young Bolland , '' he said thickly .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 17]: `` She came here to please herself , and can stay here , if she likes .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 7]: I 'll see to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 5]: Martin did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 13]: `` Ang√®le , '' he said quietly , `` come away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 30]: Seeing that he had lived in the village nearly all his life , it was passing strange that this boy should have dissociated himself so completely from its ways .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 65]: But the early hours he kept , his love of horses , dogs , and books , his preference for the society of grooms and gamekeepers -- above all , a keen , if unrecognized , love of nature in all her varying moods , an almost pagan worship of mountain , moor , and stream -- had kept him aloof from village life .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 10]: A boy of fourteen does not indulge in introspection .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 25]: It simply came as a fearful shock to find the daughter of a lady like Mrs. Saumarez so ready to forget her social standing .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 11]: Surely , she could not know what she was doing .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 8]: He was undeceived , promptly and thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 8]: Ang√®le snatched her shoulder from his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 12]: `` Do n't you dare hold me , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 6]: `` I 'm not coming .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: I wo n't come with you , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 9]: Ma foi , Frank is far nicer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 12]: `` Then I 'll drag you home , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: `` Oh , will you , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 7]: I 'll see to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 9]: Beckett-Smythe deemed Ang√®le a girl worth fighting for .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 17]: In any case , this clodhopper who spent money like a lord must be taught manners .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 3]: Martin smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 27]: In his bemused brain the idea was gaining ground that Ang√®le would be flattered if he `` licked '' the squire 's son for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 14]: `` Very well , '' he said , stepping back into the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: `` We 'll settle it that way .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: If _ you _ beat _ me _ , Ang√®le remains .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 13]: If _ I _ beat _ you _ , she goes home .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 4]: Here , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 6]: Hold my coat and hat .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 17]: And , no matter what happens , mind you do n't play for any dancing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 10]: Martin stated terms and issued orders like an emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 26]: In the hour of stress he felt himself immeasurably superior to this gang of urchins , whether their manners smacked of Elmsdale or of Eton .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 40]: Ang√®le 's acquaintance with popular fiction told her that at this stage of the game the heroine should cling in tears to the one she loved , and implore him to desist , to be calm for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 11]: But the riot in her veins brought a new sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 19]: There were possibilities hitherto unsuspected in the darkness , the secrecy , the candid brutality of the fight .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 9]: She almost feared lest Beckett-Smythe should be defeated .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 31]: And how the other girls must envy her , to be fought for by the two boys pre-eminent among them , to be the acknowledged princess of this village carnival !
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 6]: So she clapped her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 6]: `` O l√† l√† ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 9]: `` Going to fight about poor little me !
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 12]: Well , I ca n't stop you , can I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 10]: `` Yes , you can , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 12]: `` She wo n't , anyhow , '' scoffed the other .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 6]: `` Are you ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 4]: `` Quite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: `` Then ` go . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: And the battle began .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 16]: CHAPTER VI WHEREIN THE RED BLOOD FLOWS They fought like a couple of young bulls .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 10]: Frank intended to demolish his rival at the outset .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 22]: He was a year older and slightly heavier , but Martin was more active , more sure-footed , sharper of vision .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 22]: Above all , he had laid to heart the three-pennyworth of tuition obtained in the boxing booth a few hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 21]: He had noted then that a boxer dodged as many blows with his head as he warded with his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 17]: He grasped the necessity to keep moving , and thus disconcert an adversary 's sudden rush .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 20]: Again , he had seen the excellence of a forward spring without changing the relative positions of the feet .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 30]: Assuming you were sparring with the left hand and foot advanced , a quick jump of eighteen inches enabled you to get the right home with all your force .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 17]: You must keep the head well back and the eye fixed unflinchingly on your opponent 's .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 8]: Above all , meet offense with offense .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 11]: Hit hard and quickly and as often as might be .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 25]: These were sound principles , and he proceeded to put them into execution , to the growing distress and singular annoyance of Master Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 44]: Ernest acted as referee -- in the language of the village , he `` saw fair play '' -- but was wise enough to call `` time '' early in the first round , when his brother drew off after a fierce set-to .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 11]: The forcing tactics had failed , but honors were divided .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 21]: The taller boy 's reach had told in his favor , while Martin 's newly acquired science redressed the balance .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 30]: Martin 's lip was cut and there was a lump on his left cheek , but Frank felt an eye closing and had received a staggerer in the ribs .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 40]: He was aware of an uneasy feeling that if Martin survived the next round he -LRB- Frank -RRB- would be beaten , so there was nothing for it but to summon all his reserves and deliver a Napoleonic attack .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: The enemy must be crushed by sheer force .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 32]: He was a plucky lad and was stung to frenzy by seeing Ang√®le offer Martin the use of a lace handkerchief for the bleeding lip , a delicate tenderness quietly repulsed .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 16]: So , when the rush came , Martin had to fight desperately to avoid annihilation .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 13]: He was compelled to give way , and backed toward the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 6]: Behind lay an unseen stackpole .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 27]: At the instant when Beckett-Smythe lowered his head and endeavored to butt Martin violently in the stomach , the latter felt the obstruction with his heel .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 23]: Had he lost his nerve then or flickered an eyelid , he would have taken a nasty fall and a severe shaking .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 29]: As it was , he met the charge more than halfway , and delivered the same swinging upper stroke which had nearly proved fatal to his gamekeeper friend .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: It was wholly disastrous to Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 34]: It caught him fairly on the nose , and , as the blow was in accord with the correct theory of dynamics as applied to forces in motion , it knocked him silly .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 34]: His head flew up , his knees bent , and he dropped to the ground with a horrible feeling that the sky had fallen and that stars were sparkling among the rough paving-stones .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 6]: `` That 's a finisher .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 5]: He 's whopped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 4]: exulted Jim Bates .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 7]: `` No , he 's not .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 23]: It was a chance blow , '' cried Ernest , who was strongly inclined to challenge the victor on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 6]: `` Get up , Frank .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: Have another go at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 28]: But Frank , who could neither see nor hear distinctly , was too groggy to rise , and the village girls drew together in an alarmed group .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 12]: Such violent treatment of the squire 's son savored of sacrilege .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 21]: They were sure that Martin would receive some condign punishment by the law for pummeling a superior being so unmercifully .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 13]: Ang√®le , somewhat frightened herself , tried to console her discomfited champion .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 10]: `` I 'm so sorry , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 8]: `` It was all my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 7]: `` Oh , go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 3]: he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 10]: `` Ernest , where 's there a pump ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 11]: Assisted by his brother , he struggled to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 14]: His nose was bleeding freely and his face was ghastly in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 7]: But he was a spirited youngster .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: He held out a hand to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 19]: `` I 've had enough just now , '' he said , with an attempt at a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 46]: `` Some other day , when my eye is all right , I 'd like to -- '' A woman 's scream of terror , a man 's cry of agony , startled the silent night and nearly scared the children out of their wits .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 8]: Someone came running up the garden path .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 5]: It was Kitty Thwaites .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 15]: She swayed unsteadily as she ran ; her arms were lifted in frantic supplication .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 13]: `` Oh , Betsy , Betsy , you 've killed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 3]: `` Murder !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 2]: Murder !
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 4]: Come , someone !
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 8]: For God 's sake , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 10]: She stumbled and fell , shrieking frenziedly for help .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 31]: Another woman -- a woman whose extended right hand clutched a long , thin knife such as is used to carve game -- appeared from the gloom of the orchard .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 18]: Her wan face was raised to the sky , and a baleful light shone in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 19]: `` Ay , I 'll swing for him , '' she cried in a voice shrill with hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 15]: `` May the Lord deal wi ' him as he dealt wi ' me !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 7]: And my own sister , too !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 7]: Out on ye , ye strumpet !
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 17]: ` Twould sarve ye right if I stuck ye wi ' t ' same knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 19]: With a clatter of ironshod boots , most of the frightened children stampeded out of the stable yard .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 18]: Martin , to whom Ang√®le clung in speechless fear , and the two Beckett-Smythes alone were left .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 47]: The din of steam organ and drums , the ceaseless turmoil of the fair , the constant fusillade at the shooting gallery , and the bawling of men in charge of the various sideshows , had kept the women 's shrieks from other ears thus far .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 20]: But Kitty Thwaites , though almost shocked out of her senses , gained strength from the imminence of peril .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 33]: Springing up from the path just in time to avoid the vengeful oncoming of her sister , she staggered toward the hotel and created instant alarm by her cries of `` Murder !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 2]: Help !
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 7]: George Pickering has been stabbed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: A crowd of men poured out from bar and smoking-room .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 20]: One , who took thought , rushed through the front door and snatched a naphtha lamp from a stall .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 33]: Meanwhile , the three boys and the girl on the other side of the hedge , seeing and hearing everything , but unseen and unheard themselves , took counsel in some sort .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 19]: `` I say , '' Ernest Beckett-Smythe urged his brother , `` let 's get out of this .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 16]: Father will thrash us to death if we 're mixed up in this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 5]: The advice was good .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 22]: Frank forgot his dizziness for the moment , and the two raced to secure their bicycles from a stall-holder 's care .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 8]: They rode away to the Hall unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 5]: Martin remained curiously quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 7]: All the excitement had left him .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 20]: If Elmsdale were rent by an earthquake just then , he would have watched the toppling houses with equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 13]: `` I suppose you do n't wish to stop here now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 5]: he said to Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 6]: The girl was sobbing bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 13]: Her small body shook as though each gulp were a racking cough .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 5]: She could not answer .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 13]: He placed his arm around her and led her to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 16]: While they were crossing the yard the people from the hotel crowded into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 29]: The man with the lamp had reached the back of the house across the bowling green , and a stalwart farmer had caught Betsy Thwaites by the wrist .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 8]: The blood-stained knife fell from her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: She moaned helplessly in disjointed phrases .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 7]: `` It 's all overed now .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 4]: God help me !
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 6]: Why was I born ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 13]: Already a crowd was surging into the hotel through the front door .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 30]: Martin guided his trembling companion to the right ; in a few strides they were clear of the fair , only to run into Mrs. Saumarez 's German chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 29]: He was not in uniform ; in a well-fitting blue serge suit and straw hat , he looked more like a young officer in mufti than a mechanic .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 24]: He was the first to recognize Ang√®le , and was so frankly astonished that he bowed to her without lifting his hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 7]: _ You _ , mees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 11]: he cried , seemingly at a loss for other words .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 7]: Ang√®le recovered her wits at once .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 36]: She said something which Martin could not understand , though he was sure it was not in French , as the girl 's frequent use of that language was familiarizing his ears with its sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 39]: As a matter of fact , she spoke German , telling the chauffeur to mind his own business , and she would mind hers ; but if any talking were done her tongue might wag more than his .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 16]: At any rate , the man did then raise his hat politely and walk on .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 13]: The remainder of the road between Elmsdale and The Elms was deserted .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 18]: Martin hardly realized the pace at which he was literally dragging his companion homeward until she protested .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 9]: `` Martin , you 're hurting my arm !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: What 's the hurry ?
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 8]: ... Did she really kill him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 5]: `` She said so .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 9]: I do n't know , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 6]: `` Who was she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 9]: `` Kitty Thwaites 's sister , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 6]: I never saw her before .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 9]: They were not bred in this village . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 9]: `` And why did she kill him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 7]: `` How can I tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 10]: `` She had a knife in her hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 11]: `` Perhaps she killed him because she was jealous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 4]: `` Perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 10]: `` Martin , do n't be angry with me .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: I did n't mean any harm .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: I was only having a lark .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 13]: I did it just to tease you -- and Evelyn Atkinson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: `` That 's all very fine .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 7]: What will your mother say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 16]: The quietude , the sound of her own voice , were giving the girl courage .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 9]: She tossed her head with something of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 6]: `` She can say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 6]: You leave her to me .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 9]: You saw how I shut Fritz 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: What was the name of the man who was killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 5]: `` George Pickering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 10]: He walked down the garden with Kitty Thwaites . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 15]: When I get in I can tell Miss Walker and Fran√ßoise all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 6]: They will be so excited .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 10]: There will be no fuss about me being out .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 6]: V'l√† la bonne fortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 7]: `` Speak English , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 11]: `` Well , it is good luck I was there .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 9]: I can make up such a story . ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 12]: `` Good luck that a poor fellow should be stabbed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 10]: `` That was n't my fault , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 4]: Good-night , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 4]: You fought beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 4]: Kiss me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 7]: `` I wo n't kiss you .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: Run in , now .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 9]: I 'll wait till the door opens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 11]: `` Then _ I 'll _ kiss _ you _ .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 13]: I like you better than all the world -- just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 12]: She opened the gate , careless whether it clanged or not .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 13]: Martin heard her quick footsteps on the gravel of the short drive .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 7]: She rattled loudly on the door .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 8]: `` Good-night , Martin -- dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 5]: There was some delay .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 7]: Evidently she had not been missed .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 6]: `` Are you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 8]: She was impatient of his continued coldness .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 11]: `` Then why do n't you speak , silly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 10]: The door opened with the clanking of a chain .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: There was a woman 's startled cry as the inner light fell on Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 4]: Then he turned .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 23]: Not until he reached the `` Black Lion '' and its well-lighted area did he realize that he was coatless and hatless .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 11]: Jim Bates had vanished with both of these necessary articles .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 12]: Well , in for a penny , in for a pound !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 18]: There would be a fearful row , and the thrashing would be the same in any case .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 14]: He avoided the crowd , keeping to the darker side of the street .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 18]: A policeman had just come out of the inn and was telling the people to go away .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 20]: All the village seemed to have gathered during the few minutes which had elapsed since the tragedy took place .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 8]: He felt strangely sorry for Betsy Thwaites .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 14]: Would she be locked up , handcuffed , with chains on her ankles ?
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 8]: What would they do with the knife ?
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: Why should she want to kill Mr. Pickering ?
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 6]: Would n't he marry her ?
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 12]: Even so , that was no reason he should be stabbed .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 6]: Where did she stick him ?
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 14]: Did he quiver like Absalom when Joab thrust the darts into his heart ?
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 23]: At last he ran up the slight incline leading to the White House ; there was a light in the front kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 22]: For one awful moment he paused , with a finger on the sneck ; then he pressed the latch and entered .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 25]: John Bolland , grim as a stone gargoyle , wearing his Sunday coat and old-fashioned tall hat , was leaning against the massive chimneypiece .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 10]: Mrs. Bolland , with bonnet awry , was seated .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 5]: She had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 23]: A frightened kitchenmaid peeped through the passage leading to the back of the house when the door opened to admit the truant .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 4]: Then she vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 13]: There was a period of chill silence while Martin closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 23]: He turned and faced the elderly couple , and John Bolland spoke : `` So ye 've coom yam , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 10]: `` An ' at a nice time , too .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 4]: Afther half-past ten !
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 15]: An hour sen yer muther an ' me searched high and low for ye .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 5]: Where hev ye bin ?
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 9]: Tell t ' truth , ye young scamp .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: Every lie 'll mean more skin off your back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 18]: Mrs. Bolland , drying her eyes , now that Martin had returned , noticed his disheveled condition .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 15]: His face was white as his shirt , and both were smeared with blood .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 10]: A wave of new alarm paled her florid cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 5]: She ran to him .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 15]: `` For mercy 's sake , boy , what hev ye bin doin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 5]: Are ye hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 8]: `` No , mother , not hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 5]: I fought Frank Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 7]: `` T ' squire 's son .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 22]: Why on earth -- '' `` Go to bed , Martha , '' said John , picking up a riding whip .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 23]: But Mrs. Bolland 's sympathies discerned a deeper reason for Martin 's escapade than a mere boyish frolic which deserved a thrashing .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 5]: He was unnaturally calm .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 8]: Something out of the common had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 11]: He did not flinch at the sight of the whip .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 20]: `` John , '' she said sternly , `` ye sha n't touch him t ' - night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 6]: `` Stand aside , Martha .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 27]: If all my good teachin ' is of no avail -- '' `` Mebbe t ' lad 's fair sick o ' yer good teachin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 10]: You lay a hand on him at yer peril .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 17]: If ye do , I do n't bide i ' t ' house this night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 17]: Never before , during thirty years of married life , had Martha Bolland defied her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 7]: He glowered with anger and amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 15]: `` Would ye revile the Word te shield that spawn o ' Satan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 14]: `` Get away , woman , lest I do thee an injury . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 13]: But his wife 's temper was fierce as his own when roused .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 18]: She was a Meynell , and there have been Meynells in Yorkshire as long as any Bollands .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 16]: `` Tak ' yer threats te those who heed 'em , '' she retorted bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 17]: `` D'ye think folk will stand by an ' let ye raise yer hand te me ?
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 15]: ... David , William , Mary , coom here an ' hold yer master .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 12]: He 's like te have a fit wi ' passion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 8]: There was a shuffling in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: The men servants , such as happened to be in the house , came awkwardly at their mistress 's cry .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: The farmer stood spellbound .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 16]: What devil possessed the household that his authority should be set at naught thus openly ?
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 12]: It was a thrilling moment , but Martin solved the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 11]: He wrenched himself free of Mrs. Bolland 's protecting arms .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 6]: `` Father , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 8]: `` Do n't quarrel on my account .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 11]: If I must be beaten , I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 7]: I 'll take all I get .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 17]: But it 's only fair that I should say why I was not home earlier . ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 24]: Now , John Bolland , notwithstanding his dealing in the matter of the pedigree cow , prided himself on his sense of justice .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 24]: Indeed , the man who does the gravest injury to his fellows is often cursed with a narrow-minded certainty of his own righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 17]: Moreover , this matter had gone beyond instant adjustment by the unsparing use of a whip .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 11]: His wife , his servants , were arrayed against him .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 9]: By the Lord , they should rue it !
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 8]: `` Aye , '' he said grimly .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 14]: `` Tell your muther why you 've been actin ' t ' blackguard .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 6]: Mebbe she 'll understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 11]: Mrs. Bolland had the sense to pass this taunt unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 9]: Her heart was quailing already at her temerity .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 13]: `` Ang√®le Saumarez came out without her mother , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 6]: `` Mrs. Saumarez is ill .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 14]: I thought it best to remain with her and take her home again .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 17]: Frank Beckett-Smythe joined us , and he -- he -- insulted her , in a way .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 11]: So I fought him , and beat him , too .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 12]: And then George Pickering was murdered -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 8]: Bolland dropped the whip on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 12]: His wife sank into a chair with a cry of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 10]: The plowmen and maids ventured farther into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: Even the farmer 's relentless jaw fell at this terrific announcement .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 8]: `` Yes , it is quite true .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 14]: Frank and I fought in the yard of the ` Black Lion . '
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 18]: George Pickering and Kitty Thwaites went down the garden -- at least , so I was told .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 6]: I did n't see them .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 24]: But , suddenly , Kitty came screaming along the path , and after her a woman waving a long knife in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 15]: Kitty called her ` Betsy , ' and said she had killed George Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 5]: She said so herself .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 4]: I heard her .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 13]: Then some men came with a light and caught hold of Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 29]: She was going to stab Kitty , too , I think ; and Jim Bates ran away with my coat and hat , which he was holding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 27]: The effect of such a narration on a gathering of villagers , law-abiding folk who lived in a quiet nook like Elmsdale , was absolutely paralyzing .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 9]: John Bolland was the first to recover himself .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 30]: A man of few ideas , he could not adjust his mental balance with sufficient nicety to see that the tragedy itself in no wise condoned Martin 's offense .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 14]: `` Are ye sure of what ye 're sayin ' , lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 24]: he demanded , though indeed he felt it was absurd to imagine that such a tale would be invented as a mere excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 6]: `` Quite sure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 29]: If you walk down to the ` Black Lion , ' you 'll see all the people standing round the hotel and the police keeping them back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 11]: `` Well , well , I 'll gan this minit .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 26]: George Pickerin ' was no friend o ' mine , but I 'm grieved te hear o ' sike deeds as these in oor village .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 13]: I was maist angered wi ' you on yer muther 's account .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 12]: She was grievin ' so when we failed te find ye .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 16]: She thowt sure you were runned over or drownded i ' t ' beck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 18]: This was meant as a graceful apology to his wife , and was taken in that spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: Never before had he made such a concession .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 12]: `` Here 's yer stick , John , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 9]: `` Hurry and find out what 's happened .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 3]: Poor George !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 18]: I wish my tongue had n't run so fast t ' last time I seed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 33]: Bolland and the other men hastened away , and Martin was called on to recount the sensational episode , with every detail known to him , for the benefit of the household .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 11]: No one paid heed to the boy 's own adventures .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 17]: All ears were for the vengeance taken by Betsy Thwaites on the man who jilted her .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 21]: Even to minds blunted almost to callousness , the _ crime passionel _ had a vivid , an entrancing interest .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 29]: The women were quick to see its motive , a passive endurance stung to sudden frenzy by the knowledge that the faithless lover was pursuing the younger sister .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 24]: But how did Betsy Thwaites , who lived in far-off Hereford , learn that George Pickering was `` making up '' to Kitty ?
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 7]: The affair was of recent growth .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 29]: Indeed , none of those present was aware that Pickering and the pretty maid at the `` Black Lion '' were so much as acquainted with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: And where did Betsy spring from ?
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 21]: She could not have been staying in the village , or someone aware of her history must have seen her .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: Did Kitty know she was there ?
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 19]: If so , how foolish of the younger woman to be out gallivanting in the moonlight with Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 9]: The whole story was fraught with deepest mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: Martin could not answer one-tenth of the questions put to him .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 45]: Boy-like , he felt himself somewhat of a hero , until he remembered Ang√®le 's glee at the `` good luck '' of the occurrence -- how she would save herself from blame by telling Miss Walker and Fran√ßoise `` all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 4]: He flushed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 17]: He wished now that Bolland had given him a hiding before he blurted out his news .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 13]: `` Bless the lad , he 's fair tired te death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 4]: said Mrs. Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 21]: `` Here , Martin , drink a glass o ' port an ' off te bed wi ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 21]: He sipped the wine , wondering dimly what Frank Beckett-Smythe was enduring and how he would explain that black eye .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 20]: He was about to go upstairs , when hasty steps sounded without , and Bolland entered with a policeman .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 16]: This was the village constable , and , of course , well known to all .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 30]: During the feast other policemen came from neighboring villages , but the local officer was best fitted to conduct inquiries into a case requiring measures beyond a mere arrest .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 11]: His appearance at this late hour created a fresh sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 25]: `` Martin , '' said the farmer gravely , `` did ye surely hear Kitty Thwaites say that Betsy had killed Mr. Pickering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir ; I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: `` And ye heerd Betsy admit it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 18]: `` Oh , yes -- that is , if Betsy is the woman with the knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 8]: said Bolland , turning to the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 6]: `` I telt ye so .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 21]: T ' lad has his faults , but he 's nae leear ; I 'll say that for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 19]: The man took off his helmet and wiped his forehead , for the night was close and warm .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 21]: `` Well , '' he said , `` I 'll just leave it for the ` Super ' te sattle .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: Mr. Pickerin ' sweers that Betsy never struck him .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 17]: She ran up tiv him wi ' t ' knife , an ' they quarrelled desperately .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 6]: That he do n't deny .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 42]: She threatened him , too , an ' te get away frev her he was climin ' inte t ' stackyard when he slipped , an ' a fork lyin ' again ' t ' fence ran intiv his ribs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 9]: `` Is n't he dead , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 5]: exclaimed Mrs. Bolland shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: `` Not he , ma'am , and not likely te be .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 24]: He kem to as soon as he swallowed some brandy , an ' his first words was , ` Where 's Betsy ? '
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 12]: He was fair wild when they telt him she was arrested .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 28]: He said it was all the fault of that flighty lass , Kitty , an ' that a lot of fuss was bein ' made about nowt .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 8]: I did n't know what te de√§ .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 38]: Be√§th women were fair ravin ' , and said all soarts o ' things , but t ' upshot is that Betsy is nussin ' Mr. Pickerin ' now until t ' doctor comes frae Nottonby . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 18]: He still mopped his head , and his glance wandered to the goodly cask in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 8]: `` Will ye hev a pint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 3]: inquired Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: `` Ay , that I will , Mr. Bolland , an ' welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 13]: `` An ' a bite o ' bread an ' meat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 4]: added Mrs. Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 13]: `` I doa n't min ' if I do , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 11]: A glance at a maid produced eatables with lightning speed .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 14]: Mary feared lest she should miss a syllable of the night 's marvels .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 14]: The policeman had many `` bites , '' and talked while he ate .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 8]: Gradually the story became lucid and consecutive .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 14]: Fred , the groom , was jealous of Pickering 's admiration for Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 36]: Having overheard the arrangement for a meeting on Monday , he wrote to Betsy , sending her the information in the hope that she would come from Hereford and cause a commotion at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 30]: He expected her by an earlier train , but she did not arrive until 9:20 P.M. , and there was a walk of over two miles from the station .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 14]: Meanwhile , he had seen Kitty and Pickering steal off into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 41]: He knew that any interference on his part would earn him a prompt beating , so , when Betsy put in a belated appearance , he met her in the passage and told her where she would find the couple .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 14]: Instantly she ran through the kitchen , snatching a knife as she went .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 23]: Before the drink-sodden meddler could realize the extent of the mischief he had wrought , Kitty was shrieking that Pickering was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 19]: All this he blurted out to the police before the injured man gave another version of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 30]: `` Martin bears out one side o ' t ' thing , '' commented the constable oracularly , `` but t ' chief witness says that summat else happened .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 65]: There was blood on t ' knife when it was picked up ; but there , again , there 's a doubt , as Betsy had cut her own arm wi ` t. Anyhow , Betsy an ' Kitty were cryin ' their hearts out when they kem out of Mr. Pickerin 's room for towels ; and he 's bleedin ' dreadful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 9]: This final gory touch provided an artistic curtain .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 10]: The constable readjusted his belt and took his departure .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 27]: After another half-hour 's eager gossip among the elders , in which Fred suffered much damage to his character , Martin was hurried off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 12]: Mrs. Bolland washed his bruised face and helped him to undress .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 16]: She was folding his trousers , when a shower of money rattled to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 6]: `` Marcy on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 23]: she cried in real bewilderment , `` here 's a sovereign , a half-sovereign , an ' silver , an ' copper !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 17]: Martin , my boy , whatever ... '' `` Ang√®le gave it to me , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 10]: She gave me two pounds ten to spend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 6]: `` Two pund ten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 7]: I suppose it was very wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 16]: I 'll give back all that is left to Mrs. Saumarez in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 7]: Martha Bolland was very serious now .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 11]: She crept to the door of the bedroom and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 17]: `` I do hope yer father kens nowt o ' this , '' she whispered anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 6]: Then she counted the money .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 24]: `` You 've spent sixteen shillin 's and fowerpence , not reckonin ' t ' shillin ' I gev ye this mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 5]: Seventeen an ' fowerpence !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 8]: Martin , Martin , whatever on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 5]: Such extravagance was appalling .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 9]: Her frugal mind could not assimilate it readily .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: This sum would maintain a large family for a week .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 13]: `` We stood treat to a lot of other boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 11]: But do n't be vexed to-night , mother , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 6]: I 'm so tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 5]: `` Vexed , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 6]: What 'll Mrs. Saumarez say ?
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 13]: There 'll be a bonny row i ' t ' mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 10]: You tak ' it back t ' first thing .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 5]: An ' , here .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 22]: If she sez owt about t ' balance , come an ' tell me an ' I 'll make it up .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 15]: You fond lad ; if John knew this , he 'd never forgive ye .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 9]: There , honey , go te sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 13]: There were tears in her eyes as she bent and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 8]: But he was incapable of further emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 52]: He was half asleep ere she descended the stairs , and his last sentient thought was one of keen enjoyment , for his knuckles were sore when he closed his right hand , and he remembered the smashing force of that uppercut as it met the aristocratic nose of Master Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 19]: CHAPTER VII GEORGE PICKERING PLAYS THE MAN Martin was awakened by the rays of a bright autumn sun .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 45]: He sprang out of bed in a jiffy , lest he should be late for breakfast , a heinous offense at the farm ; but the sight of William feeding the pigs in the yard beneath told him that it was only half-past six .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 11]: The first puzzle that presented itself was one of costume .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 18]: Should he wear his commonplace corduroys , or don all that was left of his gray tweeds ?
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 25]: During the Feast he was supposed to dress in his best each day ; he decided to obey orders as far as was possible .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 17]: He missed the money from his trousers pocket and knew that his mother had taken it .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 23]: Also , he found that she had selected a clean shirt and collar from the drawer and placed them ready for use .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 51]: By degrees his active brain recalled the startling events of the previous evening in their proper sequence , and he found himself speculating more on the reception Mrs. Saumarez might accord than on the attitude John Bolland would certainly adopt when the overnight proceedings arranged themselves in a slow-moving mind .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 7]: He was downstairs long before seven .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 5]: The farmer was out .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 23]: Mrs. Bolland , immersed in the early cares of the household , showed no traces of the excitement of eight hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 35]: `` Martin , '' she cried as soon as she caught sight of him , `` I heerd a hen cluckin ' a bit sen at t ' bottom o ' t ' garth .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 17]: Just look i ' t ' hedge an ' see if she 's nestin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 17]: This was a daily undertaking in a house where poultry were plentiful as sparrows in Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 14]: Martin hailed the mission as a sign that normal times were come again .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 56]: A gate led into the meadow from the garden , but to go that way meant walking twenty yards or more , so the boy took a running jump , caught a stout limb of a pear tree , swung himself onto a ten-foot pile of wood , and dropped over into the field beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 11]: Mrs. Bolland witnessed the feat with some degree of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 22]: In the course of a few hours she had come to see her adopted son passing from childhood into vigorous adolescence .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 6]: `` Drat that lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 4]: she cried irately .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 10]: `` Does he want to break his neck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 29]: `` He larnt that trick t ' other day , missus , '' commented William , standing all lopsided to balance a huge pail of pig 's food .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 13]: `` He 'll mek a rare chap , will your Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 21]: `` He 's larnin ' a lot o ' tricks that I ken nowt about , '' cried Mistress Martha .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 9]: `` Nice doin 's there was last night .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 26]: How comes it none o ' you men saw him carryin ' on i ' t ' fair wi ' that little French la-di-dah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 7]: `` I dunno , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 27]: William grinned , though , for some of the men had noted the children 's antics , and none would `` split '' to the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 24]: `` But I did hear as how Martin gev t ' Squire 's son a fair weltin ' , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 33]: `` One o ' t ' grooms passed here an oor sen , exercisin ' a young hoss , an ' he said that be√§th young gentlemen kem yam at half-past ten .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 17]: Master Frank had an eye bunged up , an ' a nose like a bad apple .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 26]: He was that banged about that t ' Squire let him off a bastin ' an ' gev t ' other a double allowance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 4]: Mrs. Bolland smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 12]: `` Gan on wi ' yer wark , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 21]: `` Here 's it 's seven o'clock , half t ' day gone , an ' nothin ' done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 13]: Martin , searching for stray eggs , suddenly heard a familiar whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 17]: He looked around and saw Jim Bates 's head over the top of the lane hedge .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 6]: Jim held up a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 13]: `` Here 's yer coat an ' hat , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 9]: `` I dursent bring 'em last neet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 8]: `` Why did you run away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: inquired Martin , approaching to take his property .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: `` I was skeert .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 8]: Yon woman 's yellin ' was awful .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 7]: I went straight off yam . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: `` Did you catch it for being out late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 22]: `` Noa ; but feyther gev me a clout this mornin ' for not tellin ' him about t ' murder .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 7]: He 'd gone te bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 9]: `` Nobody was murdered , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: `` That was n't Betsy 's fault .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 16]: It 's all my eye about Mr. Pickerin ' stickin ' a fork into hisself .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 7]: There was noa fork there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 31]: `` Coss I was pullin ' carrots all Saturday mornin ' for Mrs. Atkinson , an ' if there 'd bin any fork I should ha ' seen it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 21]: `` Martin , '' cried a shrill voice from the garth , `` is that lookin ' fer eggs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 12]: Jim Bates 's head and shoulders shot out of sight instantaneously .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 19]: `` All right , mother , I 'm only getting back my lost clothes , '' explained Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 33]: He began a painstaking survey of the hedge bottom and was rewarded by the discovery of a nest of six hidden away by a hen anxious to undertake the cares of maternity .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 9]: At breakfast John Bolland was silent and severe .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 20]: He passed but one remark to Martin : `` Happen you 'll be wanted some time this mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 9]: Stop within hail until Mr. Benson calls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 7]: Mr. Benson was the village constable .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 12]: `` What will he want wi ' t ' lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: inquired Mrs. Bolland tartly .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 16]: `` Martin is t ' main witness i ' this case o ' Pickerin 's .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: Kitty Thwaites is n't likely te tell t ' truth .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 16]: Women are main leears when there 's a man i ' t ' business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 6]: `` More fools they . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 6]: `` Well , let be .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 17]: I 'm fair vexed that Martin 's ne√§m should be mixed up i ' this affair .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 47]: Fancy the tale that 'll be i ' t ' _ Messenger _ -- John Bolland 's son fightin ' t ' young squire at ten o'clock o ' t ' neet in t ' ` Black Lion ' yard -- fightin ' ower a lass .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 8]: What ailed him I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 9]: He must ha ' gone clean daft . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 25]: The farmer pushed back his chair angrily , and Mrs. Bolland wondered what he would say did he know of Martin 's wild extravagance .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 30]: Mother and son were glad when John picked up a riding-whip and lumbered out to mount Sam , the pony , for an hour 's ride over the moor .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 24]: Evidently , he had encountered Benson before breakfast , as that worthy officer arrived at half-past ten and asked Martin to accompany him .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 16]: The two walked solemnly through the fair , in which there was already some stir .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 32]: A crowd hanging around the precincts of the inn made way as they approached , and Martin saw , near the door , two saddled horses in charge of a policeman .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 22]: He was escorted to an inner room , receiving a tremulous , but gracious , smile from Evelyn as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 35]: To his very genuine astonishment and alarm , he was confronted not only by the district superintendent of police but also by Mr. Frank Reginald de Courcy Beckett-Smythe , the magnate of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 13]: `` This is the boy , your wuship , '' said Benson .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 6]: What is his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 8]: `` Martin Court Bolland , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 11]: `` One of John Bolland 's sons , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 6]: Mr. Bolland has no son .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 10]: He adopted this lad some thirteen years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 19]: Had a bolt from the blue struck Martin at that moment he could not have been more dumbfounded .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 35]: Both John and Martha had thought fit to keep the secret of his parentage from his knowledge until he was older , as the fact might tend to weaken their authority during his boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 37]: The adults in Elmsdale , of course , knew the circumstances thoroughly , and respected Mr. and Mrs. Bolland 's wishes , while the children with whom he grew up regarded him as village-born like themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 22]: It took a good deal to bring tears to Martin 's eyes , but they were perilously near at that instant .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 19]: Though the words almost choked him , he faltered : `` Is that true , Mr. Benson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 3]: `` True ?
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 7]: It 's true eneuf , lad .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 6]: Did n't ye know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: `` No , they never told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 6]: A mist obscured his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 14]: The presence of the magistrate and superintendent ceased to have any awe-inspiring effect .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 13]: What disgrace was this so suddenly blurted out by this stolid policeman ?
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 11]: Whose child was he , then , if not theirs ?
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 29]: Could he ever hold up his head again in face of the youthful host over which he lorded it by reason of his advanced intelligence and greater strength ?
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 17]: There was comfort in the thought that no one had ever taunted him in this relation .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 18]: The veiled hint in Pickering 's words to the farmer was the only reference he could recall .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: Benson seemed to regard the facts as to his birth as matters of common knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 23]: Perhaps there was some explanation which would lift him from the sea of ignominy into which he had been pitched so unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 25]: He was aroused by Mr. Beckett-Smythe saying : `` Now , my lad , was it you who fought my son last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 9]: `` Yes -- sir , '' stammered Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 9]: The question sharpened his wits to some purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: A spice of dread helped the process .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 14]: Was he going to be tried on some dire charge of malicious assault ?
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 14]: `` Hum , '' muttered the squire , surveying him with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 10]: `` A proper trouncing you gave him , too .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 10]: I shall certainly thrash him now for permitting it .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 9]: What was the cause of the quarrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 8]: `` About a girl , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 5]: `` You young rascals !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 3]: A girl !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 4]: What girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: `` Perhaps it was all my fault , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 9]: `` That is not answering my question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: `` I would rather not tell , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: Then Mr. Beckett-Smythe leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 19]: ` Pon my honor , '' he said to the superintendent , `` these young sparks are progressive .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 18]: They do n't care what happens , so long as the honor of the lady is safeguarded .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 11]: My son refused point-blank to say even why he fought .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 32]: Well , well , Martin , I see you did not come out of the fray scatheless ; but you are not brought here because you decorated Frank 's ingenuous countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 20]: I want you to tell me exactly what took place in the garden when Mr. Pickering was wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 16]: Somewhat reassured , Martin told all he knew , which was not a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 18]: The magistrate , who , of course , was only assisting the police inquiry , was perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: `` There were others present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 3]: he commented .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 21]: Master Frank and Master Ernest -- '' `` Master Frank could not see much at the moment , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 3]: Martin blushed .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 16]: `` But Ernest -- surely , he might have noted something that you missed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 7]: `` I think not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 11]: He was -- er -- looking after his brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 7]: `` And the other children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 24]: `` Several boys and girls of the village , but they were frightened by the screaming , sir , and ran away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 11]: `` Including the young lady who caused the combat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 10]: Martin thought it best to leave the point open .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: Again Mr. Beckett-Smythe laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 14]: `` I suppose this village belle is one of Mrs. Atkinson 's daughters .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 9]: I never heard tell of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 21]: All right , Martin , you can go now , but let me give you a parting word of advice .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 31]: Never again fight for a woman , unless to protect her from a blackguard , which , I presume , was hardly the cause of the dispute with Frank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 15]: `` I do n't think he was to blame at all , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 4]: Good-day , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 13]: Here 's a half-crown to plaster that damaged lip of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 18]: Left to themselves , the magistrate and superintendent discussed the advisability of taking proceedings against Betsy Thwaites .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 22]: `` I 'm sure Pickering made up his story in order to screen the woman , '' said the police officer .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 40]: `` A rusty fork was found in the stackyard , but it was thirty feet away from the nearest point of the track made by the drops of blood , and separated from the garden by a stout hedge .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 17]: Moreover , Pickering and Kitty were undoubtedly standing in the orchard , many yards farther on .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 52]: Then , again , the girl was collared by Thomas Metcalfe , of the Leas Farm , and the knife , one of Mrs. Atkinson 's , fell from her hand ; while a dozen people will swear they heard her sister calling out that she had murdered George Pickering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 6]: Beckett-Smythe shook his head doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 13]: `` It is a queer affair , looked at in any light .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 10]: Do you think I ought to see Pickering himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 34]: You can arrest Betsy Thwaites without a warrant , I believe , and , in any event , I 'll not sit on the bench if the case comes before the court . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 19]: The superintendent was only too glad to have the squire 's counsel in dealing with a knotty problem .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 29]: The social position of the wounded man required some degree of caution before proceedings were commenced , in view of his emphatic declaration that his wound was self-inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 44]: If his state became dangerous , there was only one course open to the representatives of the law ; but the doctor 's verdict was that penetration of the lung had been averted by a hair 's breadth , and Pickering would recover .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 17]: Indeed , he might be taken home in a carriage at the end of the week .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 11]: Meanwhile , the hayfork and the blood-stained knife were impounded .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 17]: The two men went upstairs and were shown to the room occupied by the injured gallant .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 25]: Kitty Thwaites , pale as a ghost , was flitting about attending to her work , the hotel being crowded with stock-breeders and graziers .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 20]: Her unfortunate sister , even more woebegone in appearance , was nursing the invalid , at his special request .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 28]: It was a puzzling situation , and Mr. Beckett-Smythe , who knew Pickering intimately , was inclined to act with the utmost leniency that the law allowed .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 18]: Betsy Thwaites , who was sitting at the side of the bed , rose when they entered .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 19]: Her white face became suffused with color , and she looked at the police officer with frightened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 34]: The magistrate saw this , and he said quite kindly : `` If Mr. Pickering is able to speak with us for a little while , you may leave us with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 17]: `` No , no , '' interrupted the invalid in an astonishingly strong and hearty voice .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 13]: `` There 's nothing to be said that Betsy need n't hear .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: Is there , lass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 13]: She began to tremble , and lifted a corner of her apron .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 35]: Notwithstanding her faithless swain 's statement to her sister , she was quite as good-looking as Kitty , and sorrow had given her face a pathetic dignity that in no wise diminished its charm .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: She knew not whether to stay or go .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: The superintendent took the hint given by the squire .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 28]: `` It would be best , under the circumstances , if we were left alone while we talk over last night 's affair , Mr. Pickering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 6]: Do n't go , Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 7]: What is there to talk over ?
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 34]: I made a fool of myself -- not for the first time where a woman was concerned -- and Betsy here , brought from Hereford by a meddlesome scamp , lost her temper .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 3]: No wonder !
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 32]: Poor girl , she had traveled all day in a hot train , without eatin ' a bite , and found me squeezing her sister at the bottom of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 20]: There 's no denying that she meant to do me a mischief , and serve me right , too .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 29]: I 'll admit I was scared , and in running away I got into worse trouble , as , of course , I could easily have mastered her .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 22]: Kitty , too , what between fear and shame , lost her senses , and poor Betsy cut her own arm .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 21]: You see , a plain tale stops all the nonsense that has been talked since ten o'clock last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 7]: `` Not quite , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 7]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe was serious and magisterial .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 16]: `` You forget , or perhaps do not know , that there were witnesses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 4]: Pickering looked alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 4]: `` Witnesses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 6]: `` What d'you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 38]: `` Well , no outsider saw the blow , or accident , whichever it was ; but a number of children saw and heard incidents which , putting it mildly , tend to discredit your story . ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 5]: Betsy began to sob .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 21]: `` I told you you had better leave the room , '' went on the squire in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 16]: Pickering endeavored to raise himself in the bed , but sank back with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 21]: The unfortunate girl forgot her own troubles at the sound , and rushed to arrange the pillow beneath his head .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 45]: `` It comes to this , then , '' he said huskily ; `` you want to arrest , on a charge of attempting to murder me , a woman whom I intend to marry long before she can be brought to trial ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 8]: Betsy broke down now in real earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: Beckett-Smythe and the superintendent gazed at Pickering with blank incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 7]: This development was wholly unlooked for .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 8]: They both thought the man was light-headed .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 4]: He smiled dryly .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 30]: `` Yes , I mean it , '' he continued , placing his hand on the brown hair of the girl , whose face was buried in the bedclothes .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 28]: `` I -- I did n't sleep much last night , and I commenced to see things in a different light to that which presented itself before .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 17]: I treated Betsy shamefully -- not in a monied sense , but in every other way .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 11]: She 's not one of the general run of girls .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 17]: I promised to marry her once , and now I 'm going to keep my promise .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 5]: That 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 6]: He was desperately in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 10]: Of that there could be no manner of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 28]: The superintendent stroked his chin reflectively , and the magistrate could only murmur : `` Gad , that changes the venue , as the lawyers say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 14]: One thought dominated the minds of both men ; Pickering was behaving foolishly .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 44]: He was a wealthy man , owner of a freehold farm of hundreds of acres ; he might aspire to marry a woman of some position in the county and end his days in all the glory of J. P.-dom and County Aldermanship .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 31]: Yet , here he was deliberately throwing himself away on a dairymaid who , not many hours since , had striven to kill him during a burst of jealous fury .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 5]: The thing was absurd .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 33]: Probably when he recovered he would see this for himself ; but for the time it was best to humor him and give official sanction to his version of the overnight quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 23]: `` Do n't keep us in suspense , squire , '' cried the wounded man , angered by his friend 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 9]: `` What are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 10]: `` Nothing , George ; nothing , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 19]: I only hope your accident with the pitchfork will not have serious results -- in any shape . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 6]: The policeman nodded a farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 23]: As they quitted the room they heard Pickering say faintly : `` Now , Betsy , my dear , no more crying .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 6]: I ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: Damn it all , one does n't get engaged to be married and yelp over it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 18]: On the landing they saw Kitty , a white shadow , anxious , but afraid to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 9]: `` Cheer up , '' said Beckett-Smythe pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 10]: `` This affair looks like ending in smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 26]: Gaining courage from the magistrate 's affability , the girl said brokenly : `` Mr. Pickering and -- my -- sister -- are quite friendly .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: You saw that for yourself , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 5]: `` Gad , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 46]: They 're going to be -- well -- er -- I was going to say we have quite decided that an accident took place and there is no call for police interference -- so long as Mr. Pickering shows progress toward recovery , you understand .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 4]: There , there !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 12]: You women always begin to cry , whether pleased or vexed .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: Bless my heart , let 's get away , Mr. Superintendent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 19]: CHAPTER VIII SHOWING HOW MARTIN 'S HORIZON WIDENS The sufferings of the young are strenuous as their joys .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 15]: When Martin passed into the heart of the bustling fair its glamour had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 22]: The notes of the organ were harsh , the gay canvas of the booths tawdry , the cleanly village itself awry .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 19]: The policeman 's surprise at his lack of knowledge on the subject of his parentage was disastrously convincing .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 8]: The man treated the statement as indisputable .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 25]: There was no question of hearsay ; it was just so , a recognized fact , known to all the grown-up people in Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 43]: Tommy Beadlam , he of the white head , ran after him to ask why the `` bobby '' brought him to the `` Black Lion , '' but Martin averted eyes laden with misery , and motioned his little friend away .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 23]: Tommy , who had seen the fight , and knew of the squire 's presence this morning , drew his own conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 44]: `` Martin 's goin ' to be locked up , '' he told a knot of awe-stricken youngsters , and they thrilled with sympathy , for their champion 's victory over the `` young swell frae t ' Hall '' was highly popular .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 11]: The front door of the White House stood hospitably open .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 26]: Already a goodly number of visitors had gathered , and every man and woman talked of nothing but the dramatic events of the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 26]: When Martin arrived , fresh from a private conversation with the squire and the chief of police , they were on the tip-toe of expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 10]: Perhaps he might add to the store of gossip .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 23]: Even Mrs. Bolland felt a certain pride that the boy should be the center of interest in this _ cause c√©l√®bre _ .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 11]: But his glum face created alarm in her motherly breast .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 15]: `` Why , Martin , '' she cried , `` what 's gone wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 15]: Ye look as if ye 'd seen a ghost wi ' two he√§ds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 21]: The all-absorbing topic to Martin just then was his own history and not the half-comprehended tragedy of the rural lovers .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 23]: If his mother 's friends knew that which was hidden from him , why should he compel his tongue to wag falsely ?
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 28]: Somehow , the air seemed thick with deception just now , but his heart would have burst had he attempted to restrain the words that welled forth .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 46]: `` Mother , '' he said , and his lips quivered at the remembrance that the affectionate title was itself a lie , `` Mr. Benson told the squire I was not your boy -- that father and you adopted me thirteen years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 9]: Mrs. Bolland 's face glowed with quick indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 4]: No one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 15]: Martin 's impetuous repudiation of his name was the last thing they looked for .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 14]: `` It is true , I suppose , '' he went on despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 15]: `` If I am not your son , then whose son am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 8]: Martha lifted her eyes to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 10]: `` Well , of all the deceitful scoundrels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 42]: `` Te think of me fillin ' his blue coat wi ' meat an ' beer last neet , an ' all t ' return he maks is te worry this poor lad 's brains wi ' that owd tale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 17]: `` Oh , he 's sly , is Benson , '' chimed in stout Mrs. Summersgill .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 32]: `` A fortnight sen last Tuesday I caught him i ' my dairy wi ' one o ' t ' maids , lappin ' up cream like a great tomcat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 5]: A laugh went round .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 8]: None paid heed to Martin 's agony .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 7]: A dullness fell on his soul .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 27]: Even the woman he called mother was angered more by the constable 's blurting out of a household secret than by the destruction of an ideal .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 13]: Such , in confused riot , was the thought that chilled him .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 5]: But he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 32]: Martha Bolland 's denunciations of the policeman only covered the pain , sharp as the cut of a knife , caused by the boy 's cry of mingled passion and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 7]: She was merely biding her time .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 24]: When chance served , she called him into the larder , the nearest quiet place in the house , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 29]: `` Martin , my lad , '' she said , while big tears shone in her honest eyes , `` ye are dear to me as my own .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 17]: I trust I may be spared to be muther te ye until ye 're a man .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 43]: John an ' me meant no unkindness te ye in not tellin ' ye we found ye i ' Lunnun streets , a poor , deserted little mite , wi ' nather feyther nor muther , an ' none te own ye .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 10]: What matter was it that ye should know sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 8]: Hev we not done well by ye ?
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 15]: When ye come to think over ` t , ye 're angered about nowt .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 38]: Kiss me , honey , an ' if anyone says owt cross te ye , tell 'em ye hev both a feyther an ' a muther , which is more 'n some of 'em can say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 11]: This display of feeling applied balm to Martin 's wounds .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 15]: Certainly Mrs. Bolland 's was the common sense view to take of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 14]: He forbore to question her further just then , and hugged her contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 20]: The very smell of her lavender-scented clothes was grateful , and this embrace seemed to restore her to him .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 22]: His brightened countenance , the vanishing of that unwonted expression of resentful humiliation , was even more comforting to Martha herself .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 24]: `` Here , '' she said , thrusting a small paper package into his hand , `` I may n't hev anuther chance .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 11]: Ye 'll find two pun ten i ' that paper .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 25]: Gie it te Mrs. Saumarez an ' tell her I 'll be rale pleased if there 's no more talk about t ' money .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 20]: An ' mebbe , later i ' t ' day , I 'll find a shillin ' fer yersen .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: But , fer goodness ' sake , come an ' tell t ' folk all that t ' squire said te ye .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 9]: They 're fair crazed te hear ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 6]: `` Mother , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 21]: he cried eagerly , `` I was so -- so mixed up at first that I forgot to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 9]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe gave me half a crown . ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 6]: `` Ye doa n't say !
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 10]: Well , I ca n't abide half a tale .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 14]: Let 's hae t ' lot i ' t ' front kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 26]: It was noon , and dinner-time , before Martin could satisfy the cackling dames as to all within his cognizance concerning Betsy Thwaites 's escapade .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 25]: Be it noted , they unanimously condemned Fred , the groom ; commiserated with Betsy , and extolled George Pickering as a true gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 23]: P. C. Benson , all unconscious of the rod in pickle for his broad back , strolled in about the eating hour .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 17]: Mrs. Bolland , brindling with repressed fury , could scarce find words wherewith to scold him .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 17]: `` Well , of all the brazen-faced men I 've ever met -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 10]: `` So you 've heerd t ' news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 3]: `` Heerd ?
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 7]: I should think so , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 8]: Martin kem yam -- '' `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 5]: Did he know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 4]: `` Know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 3]: she shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 10]: `` Was n't it ye as said it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 10]: `` No , ma'am , '' he replied stolidly .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 36]: `` Mrs. Atkinson told me , and she said that Mr. Pickerin ' had ta'en his solemn oath te do ' t in t ' presence of t ' super and t ' squire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 5]: `` Do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 4]: was the chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 22]: `` Why , marry Betsy , to be sure , as soon as he can be led te t ' church .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 6]: What else is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 17]: This stupendous addition to the flood of excitement carried away even Martha Bolland for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 39]: In her surprise she set a plate for Benson with the others , and , after that , the paramount rite of hospitality prevented her from `` having it out wi ' him '' until hunger was sated .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 34]: Then , however , she let him `` feel the edge of her tongue '' ; he was so flustered that John had to restore his mental poise with another pint of ale .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 20]: Meanwhile , Martin managed to steal out unobserved , and made the best of his way to The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 14]: Although in happier mood , he was not wholly pleased with his errand .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 30]: He was not afraid of Mrs. Saumarez -- far from it , but he did not know how to fulfill his mission and at the same time exonerate Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 35]: His chivalrous nature shrank from blaming her , yet his unaided wits were not equal to the task of restoring so much money to her mother without answering truthfully the resultant deluge of questions .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 30]: He was battling with this problem when , near The Elms , he encountered the Rev. Charles Herbert , M.A. , vicar of Elmsdale , and his daughter Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 18]: Martin doffed his straw hat readily , and would have passed , but the vicar hailed him .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 33]: `` Martin , is it correct that you were in the stableyard of the ` Black Lion ' last night and saw something of this sad affair of Mr. Pickering 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 3]: Martin blushed .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 17]: The girl 's blue eyes were fixed on his with the innocent curiosity of a fawn .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 15]: She knew him well by sight , but they had never exchanged a word .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 10]: He found himself wondering what her voice was like .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: Would she chatter with the excited volubility of Ang√®le ?
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 18]: Being better educated than he , would she pour forth a jargon of foreign words and slang ?
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 12]: Ang√®le was quiet as a mouse under her mother 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 12]: Was Elsie aping this demure demeanor because her father was present ?
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 9]: Certainly , she looked a very different girl .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 20]: Every curve of her pretty face , each line in her graceful contour , suggested modesty and nice manners .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 34]: Why , he could n't tell , but he knew instinctively that Elsie Herbert would have drawn back horrified from the mad romp overnight , and he was humbled in spirit before her .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 17]: The worthy vicar never dreamed that the farmer 's sturdy son was capable of deep emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 13]: He interpreted Martin 's quick coloring to knowledge of a discreditable episode .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 21]: He said to the girl : `` I 'll follow you home in a few minutes , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 19]: Martin thought that an expression of disappointment swept across the clear eyes , but Elsie quitted them instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 17]: The boy had endured too much to be thus humiliated before one of his own age .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 17]: `` I would have said nothing to offend the young lady , '' he cried hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 15]: Very much taken aback , Mr. Herbert 's eyebrows arched themselves above his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 44]: `` My good boy , '' he said , `` I did not choose that my daughter should hear the -- er -- offensive details of this -- er -- stabbing affray , or worse , that took place at the inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 20]: `` But you did n't mind slighting me in her presence , sir , '' was the unexpected retort .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 7]: `` I am not slighting you .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 27]: Had I met Mr. Beckett-Smythe and sought information as to this matter , I would still have asked her to go on to the Vicarage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 10]: This was a novel point of view for Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 4]: He reddened again .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 11]: `` I 'm sorry , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 9]: `` Everything has gone wrong with me to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 9]: I did n't mean to be rude . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 26]: The vicar deemed him a strange youth , but tacitly accepted the apology , and drew from Martin the story of the night 's doings .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 26]: It shocked him to hear that Martin and Frank Beckett-Smythe were fighting in the yard of the `` Black Lion '' at such an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 9]: `` How came you to be there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 4]: he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 45]: `` You do not attend my church , Martin , but I have always regarded Mr. Bolland as a God-fearing man , and your teacher has told me that you are gifted with intelligence and qualities beyond your years or station in life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 19]: `` I was there quite by accident , sir , and I could n't avoid the fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 6]: `` What caused it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 17]: `` We fought to settle that question , sir , and it 's finished now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 4]: The vicar laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 9]: `` Which means you will not tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 13]: Well , I am no disbeliever in a manly display of fisticuffs .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 16]: It breaks no bones and saves many a boy from the growth of worse qualities .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 12]: I suppose you are going to the fair this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 5]: I 'm not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 18]: `` Would you mind telling me how you will pass the time between now and supper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 52]: `` I am taking a message from my mother to Mrs. Saumarez , and then I 'll go straight to the Black Plantation '' -- a dense clump of firs situate at the head of the ghylls , or small valleys , leading from the cultivated land up to the moor .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 8]: And what will you do there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 7]: The boy smiled , somewhat sheepishly .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 20]: `` I have a nest in a tree there , sir , where I often sit and read . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 7]: `` What do you read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 14]: `` Just now , sir , I am reading Scott 's poems . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 11]: What books do you favor , as a rule ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 21]: Delighted to have a sympathetic listener , Martin forgot his troubles in pouring forth a catalogue of his favorite authors .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 14]: The more Mr. Herbert questioned him the more eager and voluble he became .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 44]: The boy had the rare faculty of absorbing the joys and sorrows , the noble sentiments , the very words of the heroes of romance , and in this scholarly gentleman he found an auditor who appreciated all that was hitherto dumb thought .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 49]: Several people passing along the road wondered what `` t ' passon an ' oad John Bolland 's son were makkin ' sike deed about , '' and the conversation must have lasted fifteen or twenty minutes , when the vicar heard the chimes of the church clock .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 4]: He laughed genially .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 23]: Although , on his part , there was an underlying motive in the conversation , Martin had fairly carried it far afield .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 18]: `` You have had your revenge on me for sending my daughter away , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 7]: `` My lunch will be cold .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 10]: Now , will you do me a favor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 11]: `` Of course , sir ; anything you ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 12]: `` Nay , Martin , make that promise to no man .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 7]: But this lies within your scope .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 15]: About four o'clock leave your crow 's nest and drop over to Thor ghyll .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 6]: I may be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 26]: Overjoyed at the prospect of a renewed chat on topics dear to his heart , the boy ran off , light-heartedly , to The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 6]: His task seemed easier now .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 21]: The wholesome breeze of intercourse with a cultivated mind had momentarily swept into the background a host of unpleasing things .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 16]: He found he could not see Mrs. Saumarez , so he asked for Miss Walker .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 4]: The lady came .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 6]: She was prim and severe .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 15]: Instantly he detected a note of hostility which her first words put beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 17]: `` My mother sent me to return some money to Mrs. Saumarez , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: `` Mrs. Saumarez is ill .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 8]: Mrs. Bolland must wait until she recovers .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 18]: As for you , you bad boy , I wonder you dare show your face here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 7]: Martin never flinched from a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 7]: `` What have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 5]: `` Can you ask ?
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 22]: To drag that poor little mite of a girl into such horrible scenes as those which took place in the village ?
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 3]: Be off !
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 18]: You just wait until Mrs. Saumarez is better , and you will hear more of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 10]: With that , she slammed the door on him .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 14]: So Ang√®le had posed as a simpleton , and he was the villain .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 8]: This phase of the medley amused him .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: He was retreating down the drive , when he heard his name called .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 3]: He turned .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 19]: A window on the ground floor opened , and Mrs. Saumarez appeared , leaning unsteadily on the sill .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 5]: `` Come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 4]: she cried imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 9]: Somehow she puzzled , indeed flustered , him .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 9]: For one thing , her attire was bizarre .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 30]: Usually dressed with unexceptionable taste , to-day she wore a boudoir wrap -- a costly robe , but adjusted without care , and all untidy about neck and breast .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 15]: Her hair was coiled loosely , and stray wisps hung out in slovenly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 46]: Her face , deathly white , save for dull red patches on the cheeks , served as a fit setting for unnaturally brilliant eyes which protruded from their sockets in a manner quite startling , while the veins on her forehead stood out like whipcord .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 5]: Martin was utterly dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 4]: He stood stock-still .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 12]: she said again , glaring at him with a curious fixity .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 5]: `` I want you .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 15]: Fran√ßoise is not here , and I wish you to run an errand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 20]: Save for a strange thickness in her speech , she had never before reminded him so strongly of Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 10]: She had completely lost her customary air of repose .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 9]: She spoke and acted like a peevish child .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 15]: Anyhow , she had summoned him , and he could now discharge his trust .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 9]: In such conditions , Martin seldom lacked words .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 27]: `` I asked for you at the door , ma'am , '' he explained , drawing nearer , `` but Miss Walker said you were ill .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 10]: My mother sent me to give you this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 15]: He produced the little parcel of money and essayed to hand it to her .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 7]: She surveyed it with lackluster eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 6]: `` I do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: Here is plenty of money .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 27]: I want you to go to the village , to the ` Black Lion , ' and bring me a sovereign 's worth of brandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: She held out a coin .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 9]: They stood thus , proffering each other gold .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 8]: `` But this is yours , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 6]: I came to return it .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 24]: I -- er -- borrowed some money from Ang -- from Miss Saumarez -- and mother said -- '' `` Cease , boy .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 9]: I do not understand , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 11]: Keep the money and bring me what I ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 16]: In her eagerness she leaned so far out of the window that she nearly overbalanced .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 7]: The sovereign fell among some flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 9]: With an effort she recovered an unsteady poise .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 7]: Martin stooped to find the money .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 7]: A door opened inside the house .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 6]: A hot whisper reached him .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 5]: `` Tell no one .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 18]: I 'll watch for you in half an hour -- remember -- a sovereign 's worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 19]: The boy , not visible from the far side of the room , heard the voice of Fran√ßoise .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 7]: The window closed with a bang .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 8]: He discovered the coin and straightened himself .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 15]: The maid was seating her mistress in a chair and apparently remonstrating with her .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 22]: She picked up from the floor a wicker-covered Eau de Cologne bottle and turned it upside down with an angry gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 4]: It was empty .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 42]: Martin , whose experience of intoxicated people was confined to the infrequent sight of a village toper , heavy with beer , lurching homeward in maudlin glee or fury , imagined that Mrs. Saumarez must be in some sort of fever .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 17]: Obviously , those in attendance on her should be consulted before he brought her brandy secretly .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: Back he marched to the front door and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 32]: Lest Miss Walker should shut him out again , he was inside the hall before anyone could answer his summons , for the doors of country houses remain unlocked all day .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 12]: The elder sister reappeared , very starchy at this unheard-of impertinence .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 14]: `` I was forced to return , ma'am , '' he said civilly .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: `` Mrs. Saumarez saw me in the drive and asked me to buy her some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 6]: She gave me a sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 17]: She looked very ill , so I thought it best to come and tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 10]: The lady was thoroughly nonplussed by this plain statement .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 29]: `` Oh , '' she stammered , so confused that he did not know what to make of her agitation , `` this is very nice of you .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 6]: She must not have brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: It is -- quite unsuitable -- for her illness .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 11]: It is really very good of you to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 27]: I -- er -- I 'm sorry I spoke so harshly just now , but -- er -- '' `` That 's all right , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 6]: It was all a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 23]: Will you kindly take charge of this sovereign , and also of the two pounds ten which Miss Ang√®le lent me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 7]: `` Which Miss Ang√®le lent you !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 4]: Two pounds ten !
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 27]: I thought you said your mother -- '' `` It is mine , please , '' said a voice from the broad landing above their heads .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 12]: Ang√®le skipped lightly down the stairs and held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 6]: Martin gave her the money .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 17]: `` I do n't understand this , at all , '' said the mystified Miss Walker .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 13]: `` Does Mrs. Saumarez know -- '' `` Mrs. Saumarez knows nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 5]: Neither does Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 18]: With wasp-like suddenness , the girl turned and faced a woman old enough to be her grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 4]: Their eyes clashed .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 24]: The child 's look said plainly : `` Dare to utter another word and I 'll disgrace your house throughout the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 4]: The woman yielded .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 6]: She waved a protesting hand .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 8]: `` It is no business of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 10]: Thank you , Martin , for coming back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 7]: Ang√®le lashed out at him next .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 5]: `` Allez , donc !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 9]: I 'll never speak to you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 6]: She ran up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 4]: He stood irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 10]: `` Anyhow , not now , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 12]: `` I may be out in an hour 's time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 8]: Miss Walker was holding the door open .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 15]: He hurried away , and Fran√ßoise saw him , wondering why he had called .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 46]: And for hours thereafter , until night fell , a white-faced woman paced restlessly to and fro in the sitting-room , ever and anon raising the window , and watching for Martin 's return with a fierce intensity that rendered her almost maniacal in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 22]: Happily , the boy was unaware of the pitiful tragedy in the life of the rich and highly placed Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 30]: While she waited , with a rage steadily dwindling into a wearied despair , he was passing , all unconsciously , into the next great phase of his career .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 14]: He took one forward step into the unknown before leaving the tree-lined drive .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 30]: He met Fritz , the chauffeur , who was so absorbed in the study of a folding road-map that he did not see Martin until the latter hailed him .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 7]: was the boy 's cheery greeting .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 6]: `` That affair is ended .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 10]: Please do n't say anything to Mrs. Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 6]: The German closed the map .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 6]: `` Whad iss ented ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 13]: he inquired , surveying Martin with a cool hauteur rare in chauffeurs .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 12]: `` Why , last night 's upset in the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 5]: `` Ah , yez .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 7]: Id iss nod my beeznez . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 8]: `` I did n't quite mean that .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 17]: But there 's no use in getting Miss Ang√®le into a row , is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 5]: `` Dat iss zo .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 6]: Vere do you leeve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 8]: `` At the White House Farm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 8]: `` Vere de brize caddle are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: Martin smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 13]: He had never before heard English spoken with a strong German accent .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 20]: Somehow he associated these resonant syllables with a certain indefinite stress which Mrs. Saumarez laid on a few words .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 10]: `` My father 's herd is well known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: Fritz 's manner became genial .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 11]: `` Zome tay you vill show me , yez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 7]: `` I 'll be very pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 16]: And will you explain your car to me -- the engine , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 5]: `` Komm now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 10]: `` Sorry , but I have an engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 23]: There was plenty of time at Martin 's disposal , but he did not want to loiter about The Elms that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 42]: This man was a paid servant who could hardly refuse to carry out any reasonable order , and it would have been awkward for Martin if Mrs. Saumarez asked him to give Fritz the sovereign she had intrusted to his keeping .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 42]: `` All aright , '' agreed the chauffeur , whose strong , intellectual face was now altogether amiable ; in fact , a white scar on his left cheek creased so curiously when he grinned that his aspect was almost comical .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 13]: `` We vill meed when all dis noise sdops , yez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 13]: and he waved a hand toward the distant drone of the fair .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 43]: Thus began for Martin another strange friendship -- a friendship destined to end so fantastically that if the manner of its close were foretold then and there by any prophet , the mere telling might have brought the seer to the madhouse .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 15]: CHAPTER IX THE WILDCAT It was nearly three o'clock when Martin re-entered the village .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 47]: Outside the boxing booth a huge placard announced , in sprawling characters , that the first round of the boxing competition would start punctually at 3 P.M. `` Owing to the illness of Mr. George Pickering , deeply regretted , '' another referee would be appointed .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 10]: It cost the boy a pang to stride on .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 12]: He would have dearly liked to watch the display of pugilism .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 35]: He might have gone inside the tent for an hour and still kept his tryst with Mr. Herbert , but John Bolland 's dour teaching had scored grooves in his consciousness not readily effaced .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 23]: The folly of last night must be atoned in some way , and he punished himself deliberately now by going straight home .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 39]: The house was only a little less thronged than the `` Black Lion , '' so he made his way unobserved to the great pile of dry bracken in which he hid books borrowed from the school library .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 46]: Ten minutes later he was seated in the fork of a tree full thirty feet from the ground and consoling himself for loss of the reality by reading of a fight far more picturesque in detail -- the Homeric combat between FitzJames and Roderick Dhu .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 10]: From his perch he could see the church clock .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 21]: Shortly before the appointed hour he climbed down and surmounted the ridge which divided the Black Plantation from Thor ghyll .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 30]: It was a rough passage , naught save gray rock and flowering ling , or heather , growing so wild and bushy that in parts it overtopped his height .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 8]: But Martin was sure-footed as a goat .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 32]: Across the plateau and down the tree-clad slope on the other side he sped , until he reached a point whence he could obtain a comprehensive view of the winding glen .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 30]: On a stretch of turf by the side of the silvery beck that rushed so frantically from the moorland to the river , he spied a small garden tent .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 35]: In front was a table spread with china and cakes , while a copper kettle , burnished so brightly that it shone like gold in the sunlight , was suspended over a spirit lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 40]: Mr. Herbert was there , and an elderly lady , his aunt , who acted as his housekeeper -- also Elsie and her governess and two young gentlemen who `` read '' with the vicar during the long vacation .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 20]: Evidently a country picnic was toward ; Martin was at a loss to know why he had been invited .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 24]: Perhaps they wished him to guide them over the moor to some distant glen or to the early British camp two miles away .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 26]: Sometimes a tourist wandering through Elmsdale called at the farm for information , and Martin would be dispatched with the inquirer to show the way .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 40]: It was a pity that Mr. Herbert had not mentioned his desire , as the daily reading of the Bible was due in an hour , and most certainly , to-day of all days , Martin must be punctual .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 11]: If his brain were busy , his eye was clear .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 10]: He sprang from rock to rock like a chamois .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 16]: Once he swung himself down a small precipice by the tough root of a whin .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 32]: He knew the root was there , and had already tested its capabilities , but the gathering beneath watched him with dismay , for the feat looked hazardous in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 16]: In a couple of minutes he had descended two hundred feet of exceedingly rough going .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 16]: He stopped at the beck to wash his hands and dry them on his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 6]: Then he approached the group .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 14]: `` Do you always descend the ghyll in that fashion , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 4]: cried the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: It is the nearest way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 14]: `` A man might say that who fell out of a balloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 15]: `` But I have been up and down there twenty times , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: `` Well , well ; my imaginary balloonist could make no such answer .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 7]: Sit down and have some tea .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 17]: Elsie , this is young Martin Bolland , of whom I have been telling you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 21]: The girl smiled in a very friendly way and brought Martin a cup of tea and a plate of cakes .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 15]: So he was a guest , and introduced by the vicar to his daughter !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 8]: How kind this was of Mr. Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 43]: How delighted Mrs. Bolland would be when she heard of it , for , however strict her Nonconformity , the vicar was still a social power in the village , and second only to the Beckett-Smythes in the estimation of the parish .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 7]: At first poor Martin was tongue-tied .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 28]: He answered in monosyllables when the vicar or Mrs. Johnson , the old lady , spoke to him ; but to Elsie he said not a word .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 22]: She , too , was at a loss how to interest him , until she noticed a book in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 38]: When told that it was Scott 's poems she said pleasantly that a month ago she went with her father to a place called Greta Bridge and visited many of the scenes described in `` Rokeby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 10]: Unhappily , Martin had not read `` Rokeby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 20]: He resolved to devour it at the first opportunity , but for the nonce it offered no conversational handle .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 41]: He remained dumb , yet all the while he was comparing Elsie with Ang√®le , and deciding privately that girls brought up as ladies in England were much nicer than those reared in the places which Ang√®le named so glibly .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 8]: But his star was propitious that day .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 26]: One of the young men happened to notice a spot where a large patch of heather had been sliced off the face of the moor .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 12]: He asked Mr. Herbert what use the farmers made of it .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 35]: `` Nothing that I can recall , '' said the vicar , a man who , living in the country , knew little of its ways ; `` perhaps Martin can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 40]: `` We make besoms of it , sir , '' was the ready reply , `` but that space has been cleared by the keepers so that the young grouse may have fresh green shoots to feed on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 12]: Here was a topic on which he was crammed with information .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 18]: His face grew animated , his eyes sparkled , the words came fast and were well chosen .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 29]: As he spoke , the purple moor , the black firs , the meadows , the corn land red with poppies , became peopled with fur and feather .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 35]: On the hilltops the glorious black cock , in the woods the dandy pheasant and swift pigeon , among the meadows and crops the whirring partridge , became actualities , present , but unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 22]: There were plenty of hares on the arable land and the rising ground ; as for rabbits , they swarmed everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 20]: `` This ghyll will be alive with them in little more than an hour , '' said Martin confidently .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 30]: `` I should n't be surprised , if we had a dog and put him among those whins , but half-a-dozen rabbits would bolt out in all directions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 11]: `` Please , can I be a little bow-wow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 3]: cried Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 28]: She sprang to her feet and ran toward the clump of gorse and bracken he had pointed out , imitating a dog 's bark as she went .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 17]: `` Take care of the thorns , '' shouted Martin , making after her more leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 18]: She paused on the verge of the tangled mass of vegetation and said , `` Shoo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 10]: `` That 's no good , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 17]: `` You must walk through and kick the thick clumps of grass -- this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 9]: He plunged into the midst of the gorse .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 3]: She followed .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 5]: Not a rabbit budged .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 14]: `` That 's odd , '' he said , rustling the undergrowth vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 10]: `` There ought to be a lot here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 7]: `` You know Ang√®le Saumarez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 5]: said the girl suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 17]: He ceased beating the bushes and looked at her fixedly , the question was so unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 12]: Yet Ang√®le had asked him the selfsame question concerning Elsie Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 11]: One girl resembled another as two peas in a pod .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 7]: `` Do you like her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 9]: `` I think I do , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 9]: `` Do you think she is pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: `` Yes , often . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 14]: `` What do you mean by ` sometimes , ' ` often ? '
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 12]: How can a girl be pretty -- ` often ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 44]: `` Well , you see , I think she is nice in many ways , and that if -- she knew you -- and copied your manner -- your voice , and style , and behavior -- she would improve very greatly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 6]: Martin had recovered his wits .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 6]: Elsie tittered and blushed slightly .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 11]: she said , and recommenced the kicking process with ardor .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 16]: Suddenly , with a fierce snarl , an animal of some sort flew at her .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 19]: She had a momentary vision of a pair of blazing eyes , bared teeth , and extended claws .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 7]: She screamed and turned her head .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 18]: In that instant a wildcat landed on her back and a vicious claw reached for her face .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 7]: But Martin was at her side .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 21]: Without a second 's hesitation he seized the growling brute in both hands and tore it from off her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 24]: His right hand was around its neck , but he strove in vain to grasp the small of its back in the left .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 12]: It wriggled and scratched with the ferocity of an undersized tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 31]: Martin 's coat sleeves and shirt were slashed to shreds , his waistcoat was rent , and deep gashes were cut in his arms , but he held on gamely .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 12]: Mr. Herbert and the others ran up , but came unarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 7]: They had not even a stick .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 45]: The vicar , with some presence of mind , rushed back and wrenched a leg from the camp table , but by the time he returned the cat was moving its limbs in its final spasms , for Martin had choked it to death .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 42]: The vicar danced about with his improvised weapon , imploring the boy to `` throw it down and let me whack the life out of it , '' but Martin was enraged with the pain and the damage to his clothing .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 36]: In his anger he felt that he could wrench the wretched beast limb from limb , and he might have endeavored to do that very thing were it not for the presence of Elsie Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 30]: As it was , when the cat fell to the ground its struggles had ended , but Mr. Herbert gave it a couple of hearty blows to make sure .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 14]: It was a tremendous brute , double the size of its domestic progenitors .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 38]: At one period in its career it had been caught in a rabbit trap , for one of its forelegs was removed at the joint , and the calloused stump was hard as a bit of stone .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 28]: A chorus of praise for Martin 's promptitude and courage was cut short when he took the table leg and went back to the clump of gorse .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 17]: `` I thought it was curious that there were no rabbits here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 6]: `` Now I know why .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 13]: This cat has a litter of kittens hidden among the whins . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: `` Are you gug-gug-going to kuk-kuk-kill them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 3]: sobbed Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: He paused in his murderous search .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 13]: `` It makes no matter now , '' he said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 7]: `` I 'll tell the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 10]: Wildcats eat up an awful lot of game . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 22]: His coolness , his absolute disregard of the really serious cuts he had received , were astounding to the town-bred men .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 12]: The vicar was the first to recover some degree of composure .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 20]: `` Martin , '' he cried , `` come this instant and have your wounds washed and bound up .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 20]: You are losing a great deal of blood , and that brute 's claws may have been venomous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 6]: The boy obeyed at once .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 6]: He presented a sorry spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 16]: His arms and hands were bathed in blood and his clothes were splashed with it .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 8]: Elsie Herbert 's eyes filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 12]: `` This is nothing , '' he said to cheer her .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 12]: `` They 're only scratches , but they look bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 43]: As a matter of fact , he did not realize until long afterwards that were it not for the fortunate accident which deprived the cat of her off foreleg , some of the tendons of his right wrist might have been severed .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 19]: From the manner in which he held her she could not get the effective claws to bear crosswise .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 20]: The vicar looked grave when a first dip in the brook revealed the extent of the boy 's injuries .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 17]: `` You are plucky enough to bear the application of a little brine , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 26]: Suiting the action to the word , he emptied the contents of a paper of salt into a teacup and dissolved it in hot water .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 19]: Then he washed the wounds again in the brook and bound them with handkerchiefs soaked in the mixture .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 24]: It was a rough-and-ready cauterization , and the pain made Martin white , but later on it earned the commendation of the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 27]: Mr. Herbert was pallid himself when Elsie handed him the last handkerchief they could muster , while Mrs. Johnson was already tearing the tablecloth into strips .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 53]: `` It is bad enough to have your wrists scored in this way , my lad , '' he murmured , `` but it will be some consolation for you to know that otherwise these cuts would have been in my little girl 's face , perhaps her eyes -- great Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 5]: -- her eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: The vicar could have chosen no better words .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 7]: Martin 's heart throbbed with pride .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 13]: At last the bandages were secured and the tattered sleeve turned down .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 16]: All this consumed nearly half an hour , and then Martin remembered a forgotten duty .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 7]: `` What time is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 4]: he said anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 7]: `` A quarter past five . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 6]: `` Oh , bother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 8]: `` I 'll get into another row .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 8]: I have missed my Bible lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 6]: `` Your Bible lesson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 13]: My father makes me read a portion of Scripture every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 11]: The vicar passed unnoticed the boy 's unconsciously resentful tone .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 10]: He sighed , but straightway resumed his wonted cheeriness .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 14]: `` There will be no row to-day , Martin , '' he promised .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 10]: `` We shall escort you home in triumphal procession .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 21]: We leave the things here for my man , who will bring a pony and cart in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 24]: Now , you two , tie the hind legs of that beast with a piece of string and carry it on the stick .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 10]: The cat is Martin 's _ spolia opima _ .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 15]: Here , Elsie , guide your warrior 's faltering footsteps down the glen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 40]: They all laughed , but by the time they reached the White House the boy was ready to drop , for he had lost a quantity of blood , and the torment of the saline solution was becoming intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 24]: John Bolland , after waiting with growing impatience long after the appointed time , closed the Bible with a bang and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 10]: `` What 's wrang wi ' ye now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 21]: inquired his spouse as he dropped morosely into a chair and answered but sourly a hearty greeting from a visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: `` Where 's that lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 3]: `` Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 7]: Has n't he come yam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 19]: She trembled for her adopted son 's remissness on this , the first day after the great rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 4]: `` Yam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 24]: -- with intense bitterness -- `` he 's not likely te hearken te t ' Word when he 's encouraged in guile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 26]: `` Eh , but there 's some good cause this time , '' cried the old lady , more flustered than she cared to show .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 14]: `` Happen he 's bin asked to see t ' squire again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 15]: `` T ' squire left Elmsdale afore noon , '' was the gruff reply .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 20]: Then the vicar entered , and Elsie , leading Martin , and the two pupils carrying the gigantic cat .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 18]: Mrs. Johnson and the governess-companion had remained with the tent and would drive home in the dogcart .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 38]: Mr. Herbert 's glowing account of Martin 's conduct , combined with a judicious reference to his anxiety when he discovered that the hour for his lesson had passed , placed even Bolland in a good humor .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 34]: Once again the boy filled the mouths of the multitude , since nothing would serve the farmhands but they must carry off the cat to the fair for exhibition before they skinned it .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 15]: The doctor came , waylaid on his return from the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 39]: He removed the salt-soaked bandages , washed the wounds in tepid water , examined them carefully , and applied some antiseptic dressing , of which he had a supply in his dogcart for the benefit of George Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 11]: `` An ' how is Mr. Pickerin ' te-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 35]: inquired Mrs. Bolland , who was horrified at first by the sight of Martin 's damages , but reassured when the doctor said the boy would be all right in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 13]: `` Not so well , Mrs. Bolland , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 9]: `` Oh , ye do n't say so .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 3]: Poor chap !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 9]: Is it wuss than ye feared for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 14]: `` No ; the wound is progressing favorably , but he is feverish .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 6]: I do n't like that .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 5]: Fever is weakening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 24]: No more would the doctor say , and Mrs. Bolland soon forgot the sufferings of another in her distress at Martin 's condition .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 13]: She particularly lamented that he should be laid up during the Feast .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 6]: At that the patient laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 10]: `` Surely I can go out , doctor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 7]: `` Go out , you imp !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 6]: Of course , you can .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 14]: But , remember , no larking about and causing these cuts to reopen .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 14]: Better stay in the house until I see you in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 38]: So Martin , fearless of consequences , hunted up `` Rokeby , '' and read it with an interest hardly lessened by the fact that that particular poem is the least exciting of the magician 's verse .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 21]: At last the light failed and the table was laid for supper , so the boy 's reading was disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 23]: More than once he fancied he had heard at the back of the house a long , shrill whistle which sounded familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 7]: Curiosity led him to the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 15]: He waited a little while , and again the whistle came from the lane .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 3]: he called .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 3]: `` Me .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 7]: Is that you , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 18]: `` Me '' was Tommy Beadlam , but his white top did not shine in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 6]: `` What 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 4]: `` Come nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 6]: I must n't shout . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 11]: Wondering what mystery was afoot , Martin approached the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 34]: `` Yon lass , '' whispered Tommy -- `` I ca n't say her name , but ye ken fine whe√§ 't is -- she 's i ' t ' fair age√§n . ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 3]: Ang√®le ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 5]: `` That 's her .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 10]: She gemme sixpence te coom an ' tell yer .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 12]: I 've bin whistlin ' till me lips is sore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 20]: `` You tell her from me she is a bad girl and ought to go home at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 4]: `` Not me !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: She 'd smack my fe√§ce . ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 9]: `` Well , I ca n't get out .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 13]: I 've had an accident and must go to bed soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 13]: `` There 's a rare yarn about you an ' a cat .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 4]: I seed it .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 14]: Honest truth -- did you really kill it wi ' your hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but it gave me something first .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 4]: Can you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 11]: My arms and left hand are all bound up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 11]: `` An ' it jumped fust on Elsie Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 10]: `` An ' yer grabbed it offen her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 3]: `` Gosh !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 11]: Yon lass is fair wild te hear all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 37]: She greeted when Evelyn Atkinson telt her yer were nearly dead , but yan o ' t ' farmhands kem along an ' we axed him , an ' he said ye were nowt worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 33]: Martin 's heart softened when he heard of Ang√®le 's tears , but he was sorry she should have stolen out a second time to mix with the rabble of the village .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 13]: `` I ca n't come out to-night , '' he said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 16]: `` Happen ye 'd be able to see her if I browt her here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 45]: The white head evidently held brains , but Martin had sufficient strength of character to ask himself what his new friends , the Herbert family , would think if they knew he was only too willing to dance to any tune the temptress played .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 15]: `` No , no , '' he cried , retreating a pace or two .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 7]: `` You must not bring her .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: I 'm going to supper and straight to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 7]: And , look here , Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 8]: Try and persuade her to go home .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 21]: If you and Jim Bates and the others take her round the fair to-night you 'll all get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 15]: You ought to have heard the parson to-day , and Miss Walker , too .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 13]: I would n't be in your shoes for more than sixpence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 5]: This was crafty counsel .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 12]: Beadlam , after consulting Jim Bates , communicated it to Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 10]: She stared with wide-open eyes at the doubting pair .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 4]: `` Misericorde ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 7]: `` Were there ever such idiots !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 18]: Because he can not come himself , he does n't want me to be with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 6]: There was something in this .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 14]: Their judgment wavered , and -- and -- Ang√®le had lots of money .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 7]: But she laughed them to scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 9]: `` Do you think I want you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 3]: `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 5]: I spit at you .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 12]: Evelyn , ma ch√©rie , walk with me to The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 19]: I want to hear all about the man who was stabbed and the woman who stabbed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 17]: Thereupon , Evelyn and one of her sisters went off with a girl whom they hated .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 23]: But she was clever , in their estimation , and pretty , and well dressed , and , oh , so rich !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 30]: Above all , she was not `` stuck up '' like Elsie Herbert , but laughed at their simple wit , and was ready to sink to their level .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 19]: Martin , taking thought before he slept , wondered why Ang√®le had not come openly to the farm .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 14]: It did not occur to him that Ang√®le dared not face John Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 8]: The child feared the dour old farmer .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 17]: She dreaded a single look from the shrewd eyes which seemed to search her very soul .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 11]: CHAPTER X DEEPENING SHADOWS The doctor came late next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 10]: He did not reach Elmsdale until after eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 15]: He called first at the White House and handed Mrs. Bolland a small package .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 14]: `` These are the handkerchiefs I took away yesterday , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 11]: `` I suppose they belong to Mr. Herbert 's household .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 6]: My servant has washed them .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: Will you see that they are returned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 7]: `` Mercy o ' me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 3]: cried Martha .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 8]: `` I nivver knew ye took 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 10]: What did ye want 'em for , docthor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 51]: `` There might have been some malignant substance -- some poisonous matter -- in the cat 's claws , and as the county analyst was engaged at my place on some other business I -- Oh , come now , Mrs. Bolland , there 's no need to be alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 29]: Martin 's wounds were cleansed , and the salt applied to the raw edges so promptly , that any danger which might have existed was stopped effectually . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 21]: Yet the doctor 's cheery face was grave that morning and his brow was wrinkled as he unfastened the bandages .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 25]: Beyond a slight stiffness of certain sinews and the natural soreness of the cut flesh , Martin had never felt better in his life .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 40]: After a disturbed slumber , when he dreamed that he was choking a wildcat -- a cat with Ang√®le 's face which changed suddenly in death to Elsie Herbert 's smiling features -- he lay awake for some hours .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 39]: Then the pain in his wrists abated gradually , he fell sound asleep , and Mrs. Bolland took care that he was left alone until he awoke of his own accord at half-past eight , an unprecedented hour .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 10]: So the boy laughed at his mother 's fears .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 13]: Her lips quivered , and she tried to choke back a sob .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 7]: The doctor turned on her angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 5]: `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 10]: `` I suppose you think I 'm hoodwinking you .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 5]: It is not so .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 21]: I am very much worried about another matter altogether , so please accept my assurance that Martin is all right .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 11]: He can run about all day , if he likes .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 16]: The only consequence of disturbing these cuts will be that they can not heal rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 15]: Otherwise , they will be closed completely by the end of the week . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 6]: While he talked he worked .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 9]: The dressings were changed and fresh lint applied .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 9]: He handed Mrs. Bolland a store of materials .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 26]: `` There , '' he said , `` I need not come again , but I 'll call on Monday , just to satisfy you .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 7]: Apply the lotion morning and night .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 4]: Good-by , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 9]: You did a brave thing , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 6]: Good-by , Mrs. Bolland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 9]: He closed his bag hurriedly and rushed away .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 21]: Mrs. Bolland , drying her eyes , and quite satisfied now , went to the door and gazed after him .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 24]: `` He 's fair rattled wi ' summat , '' she told another portly dame who labored up the incline at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 10]: `` He a ` most snapped my head off .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 30]: Did he think a body would n't be scared wi ' his talk about malignous p ` ison i ' t ' lad 's bluid , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 13]: The doctor did not pull up outside the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 43]: He drove to the Vicarage -- a circumstance which would most certainly have given Mrs. Bolland renewed cause for alarm , were she aware of it -- and asked Mr. Herbert to walk in the garden with him for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 20]: The two conversed earnestly , and the vicar seemed to be greatly shocked at the outcome of their talk .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: At last they arrived at a decision .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 11]: The doctor hastened back to the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 22]: He did not remain long in the sick room , but scribbled a note downstairs and gave it to his man .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 11]: `` Take that to Mr. Herbert , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 23]: `` I 'll make a few calls on foot and meet you at the bridge in a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 10]: The note read : `` There is no hope .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 8]: Things are exactly as I feared . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 14]: The vicar , looking most woebegone , murmured that there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 19]: He procured his hat and walked slowly to the inn , which was crowded , inside and out .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 31]: Nearly every man knew him and spoke to him , and many noted that `` t ' passon looked varra down i ' t ' mooth this mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 4]: He went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 11]: The conjecture flew around at once that Pickering was worse .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 16]: Someone remembered that Kitty Thwaites said the patient had experienced a touch of fever overnight .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 10]: Surely , his wound had not developed serious symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 22]: The chief herd of his Nottonby estate had seen him during the preceding afternoon and found his master looking wonderfully well .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 21]: Indeed , Pickering spoke of attending to some business matter in person on Saturday , or on Monday for certain .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 9]: Why , then , the vicar 's visit ?
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 5]: What did it portend ?
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 10]: People gathered in small groups and their voices softened .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 18]: By contrast , the blare of lively music and the whistle of the roundabout were intolerably loud .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 37]: In the quiet room at the back of the hotel , with its scent of iodoform mingling with the sweet breath of the garden wafted in through an open window , Pickering moved restlessly in bed .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 18]: His face was flushed , his eyes singularly bright , with a glistening sheen that was abnormal .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 13]: By his side sat the pallid Betsy , reading a newspaper aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 8]: She followed the printed text with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 5]: Her mind was troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 19]: The fatigue of nursing was nothing to one of her healthy frame , but her thoughts were terrifying .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 7]: She lived in a waking nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 22]: Had she dared to weep , she might have felt relief , but this sure solace of womankind was denied her .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 8]: The vicar 's entrance caused a sensation .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 19]: Betsy , in a quick access of fear , dropped the paper , and Pickering 's face blanched .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 17]: Some secret doubt , some inner monitor , brought a premonition of what was to come .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 12]: He flinched from the knowledge , but only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 12]: Mr. Herbert essayed most gallantly to adopt his customary cheerful mien .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 17]: `` Dr. MacGregor asked me to call and see you , George , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 10]: `` I hope you are not suffering greatly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 9]: `` Not at all , thanks , vicar .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 19]: Just a trifle restless with fever , perhaps , but the wound is nothing , a mere cut .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 21]: I 've had as bad a scratch and much more painful when thrusting through a thorn hedge after hounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 5]: That is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 13]: The reverend gentleman seemed to be strangely at a loss for words .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 5]: He glanced at Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 16]: `` Would you mind leaving me alone with Mr. Pickering for a little while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 22]: The wounded man laughed , and there was a note in his voice that showed how greatly the tension had relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 35]: `` If that 's what you 're after , Mr. Herbert , '' he said promptly , `` you may rest assured that the moment I 'm able to stir we 'll be married .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 8]: I told Mr. Beckett-Smythe so yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 10]: `` Indeed ; I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 11]: Nevertheless , I want to talk with you alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 20]: The vicar 's insistence was a different thing to the wish expressed by a magistrate and a police superintendent .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 6]: Betsy went out at once .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 19]: For an appreciable time after the door had closed no word was spoken by either of the men .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 20]: The vicar 's eyes were fixed mournfully on the valley , through which a train was winding its way .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 20]: The engine left in its track white wraiths of steam which vanished under the lusty rays of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 22]: The drone of the showman 's organ playing `` Tommy Atkins '' reached the hardly conscious listeners as through a telephone .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 13]: From a distant cornfield came the busy rattle of a reaping machine .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 10]: The harvest had commenced a fortnight earlier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 16]: Once again was the bounteous earth giving to man a hundredfold what he had sown .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: `` As ye sow , so shall ye reap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 55]: Out there in the field were garnered the wages of honest endeavor ; here in the room , with its hospital perfume , were being awarded the wages of sin , for George Pickering was condemned to death , and it was the vicar 's most doleful mission to warn him of his doom .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 25]: `` Now , Mr. Herbert , pitch into me as much as you like , '' said the patient , breaking an uneasy silence .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 16]: `` I 've been a bad lot , but I 'll try to make amends .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 8]: Betsy 's case is a hard one .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 33]: You 're a man of the world and you know what the majority of these village lasses are like ; but Betsy -- '' The vicar could bear the suspense no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 12]: He must perform his task , no matter what the cost .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 24]: `` George , '' he broke in tremulously , `` my presence here to-day is due to a very sad and irrevocable fact .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 13]: Dr. MacGregor tells me that your condition is serious , most serious .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 13]: Indeed -- indeed -- there is no hope of your recovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 21]: Pickering , who had raised himself on an elbow , gazed at the speaker for an instant with fiery eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 31]: Then , as though he grasped the purport of the words but gradually , he sank back on the pillow in the manner of one pressed down by overwhelming force .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 14]: The vicar moved his chair nearer and grasped his friend 's right hand .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 23]: `` George , '' he murmured , `` bear up , and try to prepare your soul for that which is inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 5]: What are you losing ?
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 15]: A few years of joys and sorrows , to which the end must come .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 18]: And the end is eternity , compared with which this life is but a passing shadow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 6]: Pickering did not answer immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 6]: He raised his body again .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 6]: He moved his limbs freely .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 25]: He looked at a square bony wrist and stretched out the free hand until he caught an iron rail , which he clenched fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 12]: In his veins ran the blood of a race of yeomen .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 18]: His hardy ancestors had exchanged blow for blow with Scottish raiders who sought to steal their cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 24]: They had cracked the iron rind of many a marauder , broken many a border skull in defense of their lives and property .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 20]: Never had they feared death by flood or field , and their descendant scoffed at the grim vision now .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 11]: `` What nonsense is this MacGregor has been talking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 3]: `` Die !
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 5]: A man like me !
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 17]: By gad , vicar , I 'd laugh , if I was n't too vexed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 10]: `` Be patient , George , and hear me .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 8]: Things are worse than you can guess .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 22]: Your wound alone is a small matter , but , unfortunately , the knife -- '' `` There was no knife !
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 6]: It was a pitchfork ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 9]: `` Bear with me , I pray you .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 18]: You will need to conserve your energy , and your protest only makes my duty the harder .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 16]: The knife has been submitted to analysis , as well as corpuscles of your blood .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 12]: Alas , that it should fall to me to tell it !
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 15]: Alas , for the poor girl whom you have declared your intention to marry !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 23]: The knife had been used to carve grouse , and some putrid matter from a shot wound had dried on the blade .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 7]: This was communicated to your system .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: The wound was cleansed too late .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 21]: Your blood was poisoned before the doctor saw you , and -- and -- there is no hope now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 6]: The vicar bowed his head .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 19]: He dared not look in the eyes of the man to whom he was conveying this dire sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 13]: He felt Pickering subsiding gently to the pillow and straightening his limbs .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 5]: `` How long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 22]: The words were uttered in a singularly calm voice -- so calm that the pastor ventured to raise his sorrow-laden face .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 3]: `` Soon .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 4]: Perhaps three days .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 4]: Perhaps a week .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 6]: But you will be delirious .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 10]: You have little time in which to prepare . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 4]: Again a silence .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 27]: A faint shriek reached them from afar , the whistle of the train entering Nottonby , the pleasant little town which Pickering would never more see .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 6]: `` What a finish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 11]: `` I 'd have liked it better in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 16]: I would n't have cared a damn if I broke my neck after hounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 17]: Another pause , and the vicar said gently : `` Have you made your will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: `` Then it must be attended to at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 6]: `` Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 6]: Then , there 's Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: Oh , God , I 've treated her badly .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 9]: Now , help me , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 16]: There 's a hundred pounds in notes and some twenty-odd in gold in that drawer .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 10]: Telegraph first to Stockwell , my lawyer in Nottonby .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 4]: Bring him here .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 13]: Then , spare no money in getting a license for my marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 10]: I ca n't die unless that is put right .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 10]: Do n't delay , there 's a good chap .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 12]: You have to apply to the Archbishop , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 8]: You 'll do everything , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 10]: Will you be a trustee under my will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 9]: `` Yes , if you wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 9]: `` It 'll please me more than anything .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 11]: Of course , I 'll make it worth your while .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 7]: I insist , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 4]: Go , now !
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: Do n't lose a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 3]: Send Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 19]: And , vicar , for Heaven 's sake , not a word to her until we are married .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: I 'll tell her the fever is serious ; just that , and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 7]: `` One other matter , George .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 14]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe will come here to-day or to-morrow to take your sworn deposition .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 17]: You must not die with a lie on your conscience , however good the motive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 14]: `` I 'll jump that fence when I reach it , Mr. Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 8]: Meanwhile , the lawyer and the license .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 5]: They 're all-important . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 7]: The vicar left it at that .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 32]: He deemed it best to take the urgent measures of the hour off the man 's mind before endeavoring to turn his thoughts toward a fitting preparation for the future state .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 9]: With a reassuring handclasp , he left him .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 9]: The two sisters waylaid him in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 24]: `` Ye had but ill news , I fear , sir , '' said Betsy despairingly , catching Mr. Herbert by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 7]: The worried man stooped to deception .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 11]: `` Now , why should you jump to conclusions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 11]: `` Dr. MacGregor asked me to look up his patient .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 14]: Am I a harbinger of disaster , like Mother Carey 's chickens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 26]: `` Oh , parson , '' she wailed , `` I read it i ' yer face , an ' in t ' doctor 's .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 8]: Do n't tell me all is well .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: I know better .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 21]: Pray God I may die -- '' `` Hush , my poor girl , you know not what you say .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 5]: Go to Mr. Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 5]: He wants you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 8]: He knew the appeal would be successful .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 4]: She darted off .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 13]: Before Kitty , in turn , could question him , he escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 12]: It was easier to run the gantlet of friendly inquirers outside .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 20]: He telegraphed to the solicitor and sent a telegraphic remittance of the heavy fees demanded for the special license .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 24]: Within two hours he had the satisfaction of knowing that the precious document was in the post and would reach him next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 16]: Mr. Stockwell 's protests against Pickering 's testamentary designs were cut short by his client .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 49]: `` Look here , Stockwell , '' was the irritated comment , `` you are an old friend of mine and I 'd like this matter to remain in your hands , but if you say another word I 'll be forced to send for someone else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 13]: `` If you put it that way -- '' began the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 7]: `` I do , most emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 8]: Now , what is it to be ?
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 5]: Yes or no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 19]: For answer the legal man squared some foolscap sheets on a small table and produced a stylographic pen .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 10]: `` Let me understand clearly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 25]: `` You intend to marry this -- er -- lady , and mean to settle four hundred a year on her for life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 7]: `` Suppose she marries again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 20]: `` God in heaven , man , do you think I want to play dog-in-the-manger in my grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 13]: `` Then it had better take the form of a marriage settlement .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 16]: It is the strongest instrument known in the law and avoids the death duties . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 10]: Pickering winced , but the lawyer went on remorselessly .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 27]: He regarded the marriage as a wholly quixotic notion , and knew only too well that Betsy Thwaites would be tried for murder if Pickering died .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 7]: `` Have you no relatives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 12]: `` I seem to recollect -- '' `` My cousin Stanhope ?
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 18]: He 's quite well off , an M.P. , and likely to be made a baronet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 18]: `` He will not object to the chance of dropping in for # 1,500 a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 12]: `` Do you think the estate will yield so much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 6]: `` More , I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 9]: Did you ever know what you spent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 12]: `` Well , is it to be this Mr. Stanhope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 7]: He never gave me a thought .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 9]: Why should I endow him and his whelps ?
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 15]: Let the lot go to the County Council in aid of the county orphanage .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 9]: By Jove , that 's a good idea !
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 5]: I like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 4]: demanded the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 11]: You and Mr. Herbert are to be the trustees . ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 6]: `` The deuce we are .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 5]: Who said so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 5]: `` I say so .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 17]: You are to receive # 50 a year each from the estate for administering it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: That gilds the pill .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 3]: Next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 10]: `` I have nearly a thousand in the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 38]: Keep half as working capital , give a hundred to my company in the Territorials , and divide the balance , according to salary , among all my servants who have more than five years ' service .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 20]: And -- Betsy is to have the use of the house and furniture , if she wishes it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 10]: Pickering was exhausted , but continued to laugh weakly .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 8]: `` Yes ; I had almost forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 36]: I bequeath to John Bolland the shorthorn cow he sold me , and to that lad of his -- you must find out his proper name -- my pair of hammerless guns and my sword .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 16]: He frames to be a sportsman , and I think he 'll make a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 19]: He picked up a poker like a shot the other day when I quarreled with old John . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 8]: `` What was the quarrel about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 14]: `` When you send back the cow , you 'll be told . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 7]: Mr. Stockwell scanned his notes rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 16]: `` I 'll put my clerks to work at this to-night , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 17]: `` As I am a trustee , my partner will attend to-morrow to get your signature .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 21]: Of course , you know you must be married before you make your will , or it will be invalid ?
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: Before I go , George , are you sure it is all over with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 5]: `` MacGregor says so .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 6]: I suppose he knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 11]: `` Yes , he knows , if any man does .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 7]: Yet I ca n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 7]: It seems monstrous , incredible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 7]: They gazed fixedly at each other .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 13]: Of the two , the man of law was the more affected .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 34]: Before either could speak again they heard Betsy 's agonized cry : `` Oh , for God 's sake , miss , do n't tell me I may not be with him always !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 11]: I 've done my best ; I have , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 10]: I 'll give neither him nor you any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 16]: Do n't keep me away from him now , or I 'll go mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 21]: The lawyer , wondering what new frenzy possessed the woman who had struck down his friend , opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 12]: He was confronted by a hospital nurse sent by Dr. MacGregor .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 19]: She looked like a strong-minded person and was probably a stickler for the etiquette of the sick room .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: He took in the situation at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 19]: `` There need be no difficulty , nurse , where Miss Thwaites is concerned , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 32]: `` She is to be married to Mr. Pickering to-morrow , and as he has only a few days to live they should see as much of each other as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 24]: Any other arrangement would irritate your patient greatly , and be quite contrary to Dr. MacGregor 's wishes , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 19]: The nurse bowed , and Betsy sobbed as the secret that was no secret to her was revealed .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 34]: None of the three realized that several men standing in the hall beneath , whose talk had been silenced by Betsy 's frenzied exclamation , must have heard every word the lawyer uttered .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 25]: CHAPTER XI FOR ONE , THE NIGHT ; FOR ANOTHER , THE DAWN So Elmsdale was given another thrill , and a lasting one .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 5]: The Feast was ruined .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 11]: Not a man or a woman had heart for enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 37]: If a child sought a penny , it was chided sharply and asked what it meant by gadding about `` when poor George Pickerin ' an ' that lass of his were in such trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 19]: Martin heard the news while standing outside the boxing booth , waiting for the sparring competition to commence .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 21]: He went in , it is true , and saw some hard hitting , but the tent was nearly empty .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 18]: When he and Jim Bates came out an hour later , Elmsdale was a place of mourning .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 33]: A series of exciting events , each crowding on its predecessor 's heels as though some diabolical agency had resolved to disturb the community , had roused the hamlet from its torpor .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 14]: Five slow-moving years had passed since the village had been stirred so deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 10]: Then it endured a fortnight 's epidemic of suicide .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 8]: A traveling tinker began the uncanny cycle .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 35]: On a fine summer 's day he was repairing his kettles on a corner of the green , when he was observed to leave his little handcart and to go into a neighboring wood .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 5]: He did not return .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 26]: Search next day discovered him swaying from a branch of a tall tree , looking like some forlorn scarecrow suspended there by a practical joker .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 42]: The following morning a soldier on furlough , one of the very men who helped to cut down the tinker 's body , went into a cow-house at the back of his mother 's cottage and suspended himself from a rafter .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 24]: An odd feature of this man 's exit was that the rope had yielded so much that his feet rested on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 29]: Before the hanging he had actually cut letters out of his red-cloth tunic and formed the word , `` Farewell '' in a semicircle on the stable floor .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 53]: A girl soon afterwards selected the mill-dam for a consoling plunge ; and , to crown all , the vicar , Mr. Herbert 's forerunner , having received a telegram announcing the failure of a company in which he had invested some money , opened his jugular vein with a sharp scissors .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 29]: That these tragedies should happen within a fortnight in a community of less than three hundred people was enough to give a life-insurance actuary an attack of hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 19]: But each lacked the dramatic flavor attached to the ill-governed passion of Betsy Thwaites and her fickle swain .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 24]: Kitty was known to all in Elmsdale , Betsy to few , but George Pickering was a popular man throughout the whole countryside .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 26]: It was sensation enough that one of his many amours should result in an episode more typical of Paris than of an English Sleepy Hollow .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 40]: But the sequel -- the marriage of this wealthy gentleman-farmer to a mere dairymaid , followed by his death from a wound inflicted by the bride-to-be -- this was undiluted melodrama drawn from the repertoire of the Petit Guignol .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 8]: That night the story spread over England .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 24]: A reporter from the _ Messenger _ came to Elmsdale to glean the exact facts as to Mr. Pickering 's `` accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 23]: Owing to the peculiar circumstances , he , perforce , showed much discretion in compiling the story telegraphed to the Press Association .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 31]: Not even the use of that magic word `` alleged '' would enable him to charge Betsy Thwaites with attempted murder , after the police had apparently withdrawn the accusation .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 21]: But he contrived to retail the legend by throwing utter discredit on it , and the rest was plain sailing .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 9]: Moreover , he was a smart young man .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 8]: He pondered deeply after dispatching the message .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 31]: He was employed on the staff of a local weekly newspaper , so his traveling allowance was limited to a third-class return ticket and a shilling for `` tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 12]: Yet he decided to remain in Elmsdale at his own expense .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 21]: The departure of the German Government agent for another horse-fair left a vacant bedroom at the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 4]: This he secured .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 6]: He foresaw a golden harvest .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 4]: Luck favored him .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 29]: Conversing with a village Solon in the bar , he caught a remark that `` John Bolland 's lad '' would be an important witness at the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 45]: Of course , he made inquiries and was favored with a full and accurate account of the wanderings of the farmer and his wife in London thirteen years earlier , together with their adoption of the baby which had literally fallen from the skies .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 34]: To the country journalist , Fleet Street is the Mecca of his earthly pilgrimage , and St. Martin 's Court , Ludgate Hill , was near enough to newspaperdom to be sacred ground .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 12]: The very name of the boy smacked of `` copy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 15]: John Bolland , lumbering out of the stockyard at tea-time , encountered Dr. MacGregor .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 38]: The farmer had been thinking hard while striding through his diminished cornfields , and crumbling ears of wheat , oats , and barley in his strong hands to ascertain the exact date when they would be ripe .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 39]: Already some of his neighbors were busy , but John was more anxious about the condition of the straw than the forwardness of the grain ; moreover , men and women did not work so well during feast-time .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 11]: Next week he would obtain full measure for his money .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 10]: `` I reckon Martin 'll soon be fit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 4]: The doctor nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 10]: `` He 's a bright lad , yon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 5]: went on the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 10]: What are you going to make of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: Dr. MacGregor knew the ways of Elmsdale folk .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 11]: They required leading up to a subject by judicious questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 10]: Rarely would they unburden their minds by direct statements .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 14]: `` That 's what 's worryin ' me , '' said John slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: `` What d'ye think yersen , docthor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 7]: `` It is hard to say .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 13]: It all hinges on what you intend doing for him , Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 6]: He is not your son .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 21]: If he has to depend on his own resources when he 's a man , teach him a useful trade .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 15]: No matter how able he may be , that will never come amiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 5]: The farmer gazed around .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 25]: As men counted in that locality , he was rich , not in hard cash , but in lands , stock , and tenements .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 10]: His expenses did not grow proportionately with his earnings .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 32]: He ate and dressed and economized now as on the day when Martha and he faced the world together , with the White House and its small meadows their only belongings .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 27]: In a few years the produce of his shorthorn herd alone would bring in hundreds annually , and his Cleveland bays were noted throughout the county .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: He took the doctor 's hint .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 14]: `` I 've nayther chick nor child but Martin , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 22]: `` When Martha an ' me are gone te t ' Lord , all that we hev 'll be Martin 's .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 6]: That 's settled lang syne .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: I med me will four years agone last Easter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 11]: There was something behind this , and MacGregor probed again .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 11]: `` Is n't he cut out for a farmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 12]: `` I hae me doots , '' was the cautious answer .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: The doctor waited , so John continued .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 13]: `` I was sair set on t ' lad being a minister .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 12]: But I judge it 's not t ' Lord 's will .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 11]: He 's of a rovin ' stock , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 16]: When he 's a man , Elmsdale wo n't be big eneuf te hold him .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: He cooms frae Lunnon , an ' te Lunnon he 'll gang .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 6]: It 's in his fe√§ce .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 23]: Lunnon 's a bad ple√§ce for a youngster whe√§ kens nowt but t ' ways o ' moor folk , docthor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 5]: Then the other laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 22]: `` In a word , Bolland , you have made up your mind , and want me to agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 23]: Of course , if Martin succeeds you , and you have read his character aright , there is but one line open .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 40]: Send him to a good school , leave the choice of a profession to his more cultivated mind , and tie up your property so that it can not be sold and wasted in a young man 's folly .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 24]: When he is forty he may be glad to come back to Elmsdale and give thanks for your foresight on his bended knees .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 17]: In any event , a little extra book lore will make him none the worse stock-raiser .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 9]: Eh , is that what you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 9]: `` You 're a sound man , docthor .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 36]: There 's times I wunner hoo it happens ye cling te sike nonsense as that mad Dutchman -- '' MacGregor laughed again , and nudged his groom 's arm as a signal to drive on .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 26]: He favored neither church nor chapel , but claimed a devoted adherence to the doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg , thus forming a sect unto himself .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 11]: There was not a Swedenborgian temple within a hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 11]: Mayhap the doctor 's theological views had a geographical foundation .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 15]: The farmer lumbered across the street and took a corner of the crowded tea-table .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 15]: Mrs. Summersgill was entertaining the company with a description of George Pickering 's estate .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 13]: `` It 's a meracle , that 's what it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 16]: `` Te think of Betsy Thwaites livin ' i ' style in yon fine hoos !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 37]: There 's a revenue o ' trees quarther of a mile long , an ' my husband sez t ' high-lyin ' land grows t ' best wuts -LRB- oats -RRB- i ' t ' county .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 40]: An ' she 's got it by a prod wi ' a carving-knife , while a poor body like me hez te scrat sae hard for a livin ' that me fingers are worn te t ' bone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 13]: Mrs. Summersgill weighed sixteen stone , but she was heedless of satire .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 12]: Her eye fell on Martin , eating silently , but well .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 17]: `` Some folks git their bread easy , I 'm sure , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 43]: `` Ivver sen I was a bit lass I 've tewed and wrowt an ' mead sike deed ower spendin ' hawpenny , whiles uthers hev a silver spoon thrust i ' their gob frae t ' time they 're born ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 14]: `` T ' Lord gives , an ' t ' Lord taks away .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 18]: Ye munnot fly i ' t ' fe√§ce o ' t ' Lord , '' said Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 16]: `` I 'm not built for flyin ' anywhere , '' cried the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 6]: `` I wish I was .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 9]: 'T is flighty ` uns as wins nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 5]: Look at Betsy Thwaites !
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 5]: Look at Mrs. Saumarez !
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 16]: She mun hae gotten her money varra simple te fling it about as she does .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 30]: My man telt me that her little gal , t ' other neet -- '' `` Yer cup 's empty , Mrs. Summersgill , '' put in Martha quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 12]: `` Bless my heart , ye talk an ' eat nowt .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 15]: Speakin ' o ' Mrs. Saumarez , hez anyone heerd if she 's better ?
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 13]: One o ' Miss Walker 's maids said she was poorly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 10]: Martin caught his mother 's eye , and rose .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 9]: He went upstairs ; the farmer followed him .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 23]: The two sat near the window ; on the broad ledge reposed the Bible ; but Bolland did not open the book .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 13]: He laid his hand on it reverently and looked at the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 31]: `` Martin , '' he began , `` yer muther tells me that Benson med yer mind sair by grabbin ' te t ' squire aboot yer bringin ' up .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: Nay , lad , ye need n't say owt .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 5]: 'T is no secret .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 12]: We on ' y kept it frae ye for yer good .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 19]: Anyhow , 't is kent noo , an ' there 's nae need te chew on ` t .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 23]: What troubled me maist was yer muther 's defiance when I was minded te punish ye for bein ' out late . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 14]: `` It wo n't occur again , sir , '' said Martin quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 3]: `` Mebbe .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 14]: T ' spirit is willin ' , but t ' flesh is wake .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 12]: Noo , I want a straight answer te a straight question .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 10]: Are these Bible lessons te yer likin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 19]: It was so rare for the farmer to speak in this downright fashion that the boy was alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 20]: He knew not what lay behind ; but he had not earned his reputation for honesty on insufficient grounds .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 11]: `` No , they 're not , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 3]: Bolland groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 7]: `` T ' minister said so .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 6]: `` I can hardly explain .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 12]: For one thing , I do n't understand what I read .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 23]: And often I would like to be out in the fields or on the moor when I 'm forced to be here .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 35]: All the same , I do try hard , and if I thought it would please you and mother , I 'd do much more than give up half an hour a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 5]: `` Ay , ay .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 7]: 'T is compulsion , not love .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 40]: I telt t ' minister that Paul urged insistence in season an ' out o ' season , but he held that the teachin ' applied te doctrine , an ' not te Bible lessons for t ' young .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 16]: Well , Martin , I 've weighed this thing , an ' not without prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 94]: I 've seen many a field spoiled by bad farmin ' , an ' , when yer muther calls my own hired men te help her age√§n me ; when a lad like you goes fightin ' young gentlemen aboot a lass ; when yon Frenchified ninny eggs ye on te spend money like watter , an ' yer muther gies ye t ' brass next day te pay Mrs. Saumarez , lest it should reach my ears -- why , I 've coom te believe that my teachin ' is mistakken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 13]: Martin was petrified at hearing his delinquencies laid bare in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 39]: He had not realized that the extravagant display of Monday must evoke comment in a small village , and that Bolland could not fail to interpret correctly his wife 's anxiety to hush up all reference to it .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 14]: He blushed and held his tongue , for the farmer was speaking again .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 14]: `` T ' upshot of all this is that I 've sought counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 29]: Ye 're an honest lad , I will say that fer ye , but ye 're a lad differin ' frae those of yer age i ' Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 52]: If all goes well wi ' me , ye 'll nivver want food nor lodgin ' , but an idle man is a wicked man , nine times out o ' ten , an ' I 'd like te see ye sattled i ' summat afore I go te my rest .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 41]: You 're not cut out fer t ' ministry , ye 're none for farmin ' , an ' I 'd sooner see ye dead than dancin ' around t ' countryside after women , like poor George Pickerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 43]: Soa ye mun gang te college an ' sharpen yer wits , an ' happen fower or five years o ' delvin ' i ' books 'll shape yer life i ' different gait te owt I can see at this minnit .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 7]: What think you o n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 16]: `` Oh , I should like it better than anything else in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 11]: The boy 's eyes sparkled at this most unlooked-for announcement .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 25]: Never before had his heart so gone out to the rugged old man whose stern glance was now searching him through the horn-rimmed spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 7]: What magician had transformed John Bolland ?
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 48]: Was it possible that beneath the patriarchial inflexibility of the rugged farmer 's character there lay a spring of human tenderness , a clear fountain hidden by half a century of toil and narrow religion , but now unearthed forcibly by circumstances stronger than the man himself ?
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 10]: The boy could not put these questions into words .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 13]: He was too young to understand even the meaning of psychological analysis .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 16]: He could only sit there mute , stunned by the glory of the unexpected promise .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 31]: Of course , if a thinker like Dr. MacGregor were aware of all the facts , he would have seen that the rebellion of Martha had been a lightning stroke .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 20]: The few winged words she shot at her husband on that memorable night had penetrated deeper than she thought .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 49]: It chanced , too , that the revivalist preacher whom Bolland took into his confidence was a man of sound common sense , and much more acute in private life than anyone could imagine who witnessed his methods of hammering the Gospel into the dullards of the village .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 22]: He it was who advised a timely diminution of devotional exercises which were likely to become distasteful to a spirited lad .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 25]: He recommended the farmer to educate Martin beyond the common run , while the choice of a profession might be left to maturer consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 27]: Among the many influences conspiring in that hour to mold the boy 's future life , none was more wholesome than that of the tub-thumping preacher .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 11]: Bolland seemed to be gratified by Martin 's tongue-tied enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 9]: `` Well , '' he said , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 15]: `` Noo my hand 's te t ' plow I 'll keep it there .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 36]: Remember , Martin , when ye tak te study t ' Word o ' yer own accord , ye can start at t ' second chapter o ' t ' Third Book o ' Kings .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 29]: I 'll be throng wi ' t ' harvest until t ' middle o ' September , but I 'll ax Mr. Herbert te recommend a good school .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 17]: He 's a fair man , if he does lean ower much te t ' Romans .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 16]: Soa , fer t ' next few days , run wild an ' enjoy yersen .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 12]: Happen ye 'll never hae as happy a time again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 21]: He patted the boy 's head , a rare sign of sentiment , and walked heavily out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 20]: Martin saw him cross the road and clout a stable-boy 's ears because the yard was not swept clean .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 17]: Then he called to his foreman , and the two went off to the low-lying meadows .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 27]: Bolland had been turning over in his mind Mrs. Saumarez 's remarks about draining ; they were worthy of consideration and , perhaps , of experiment .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 7]: Martin remained standing at the window .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 38]: So he was to leave Elmsdale , go out into the wide world beyond the hills , mix with people who spoke and acted and moved like the great ones of whom he had read in books .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 11]: He was glad of it ; oh , so glad !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 11]: He would learn Greek and Latin , French and German .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 10]: No longer would the queer-looking words trouble his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 10]: Their meaning would be made clear to his understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 30]: He would soon acquire that nameless manner of which the squire , the vicar , Mrs. Saumarez , the young university students he met yesterday , possessed the secret .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 28]: Elsie Herbert had it , and Ang√®le was veneered with it , though in her case he knew quite well that the polish was only skin deep .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 52]: It was what he had longed for with all his heart , yet now that the longing was to be appeased he had never felt more drawn to his parents ; his only by adoption , it was true ; but nevertheless father and mother by every tie known to him .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 9]: By the way , whose child was he ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 19]: No one had told him the literal manner in which he fell into the hands of the Bollands .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 9]: Probably his real progenitors were dead long since .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 41]: Were it not for the kindness of the farmer and his wife he might have been reared in that awful place , the `` Union , '' of which the poverty-stricken old people in the parish spoke with such dread .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 8]: His own folk must have been poor .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 17]: Those who were well off were fond of their children and loth to part from them .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 14]: Well , he must be a real son to John and Martha Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 10]: They should have reason to be proud of him .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 10]: He would do nothing to disgrace their honored name .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 9]: What was it his father said just now ?
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 23]: When he studied the Bible of his own accord he might begin at the second chapter of the Second Book of Kings .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 26]: It would please the old man to know that he gave the first moment of liberty to reading the Word which was held so precious .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 24]: He opened the book at the page where the long , narrow strip of black silk marked the close of the last lesson .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 190]: For the first time in his life the boy brought to bear on the task an unaided and sympathetic intelligence , and this is what he read : `` Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying , `` I go the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and shew thyself a man ; `` And keep the charge of the Lord thy God , to walk in his ways , to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and his testimonies , as it is written in the law of Moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest , and whithersoever thou turnest thyself : `` That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me , saying , If thy children take heed to their way , to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , there shall not fail thee -LRB- said he -RRB- a man on the throne of Israel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 25]: Not even a boy of fourteen could peruse these words unmoved , coming , as they did , after the memorable interview with Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 11]: The black letters seemed to Martin to have fiery edges .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 7]: They burnt themselves into his brain .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 23]: In years to come they were fated to stand out unbidden before the eyes of his soul many a time and oft .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 30]: He read on , but soon experienced the old puzzled feeling when he encountered the legacy of revenge which David bequeathed to his son after delivering that inspired message .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 52]: It reminded Martin of the farmer 's dignified and quite noble-hearted renunciation of his own dreams in order to follow what he thought was the better way , to be succeeded by his passage to the farm buildings across the road in order to box the ears of a lazy hind .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 16]: Ere he closed the book , Martin went over the opening verses of the chapter .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 29]: He promised himself to obey the injunctions therein contained , and it was with a host of unformed ideals churning in his brain that he descended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 9]: Mrs. Bolland was gazing through the front door .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 33]: `` Mercy on us , '' she cried , `` if there is n't Mrs. Saumarez coomin ' doon t ' road wi ' t ' nuss an ' her little gell .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 11]: An ' do n't she look ill , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 24]: I 'll lay owt she hez eaten summat as disagreed wi ' her , an ' it gev her a bilious attack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 10]: `` Dod , ay , '' said Mrs. Summersgill .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 13]: `` Some things are easy te swallow , but hard te digest .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 23]: Ye could hev knocked me down wi ' a feather when our Tommy bolted a glass ally last June twelve months . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 12]: CHAPTER XII A FRIENDLY ARGUMENT Mrs. Saumarez did indeed look unwell .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 34]: It was not that her pallor was marked or her gait feeble ; obviously , she had applied cosmetics to her face , and her carriage was as imposing and self-possessed as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 16]: But her cheeks were swollen , her eyes bloodshot , her eyelids puffy and discolored .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 54]: To a certain extent , too , she simulated the appearance of illness by wearing a veil of heliotrope tint , for it was part of her intent to-day to persuade Elmsdale that her complete seclusion from its society during the past forty-eight hours was due to a cause beyond her own control .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 24]: In very truth this was so ; she suffered from a malady far worse than any case of dyspepsia ever diagnosed by doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 8]: The unfortunate woman was an erratic dipsomaniac .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 50]: She would exist for weeks without being troubled by a craving for drink ; then , without the slightest warning or contributory error on her part , the demon of intoxication would possess her , and she yielded so utterly as to become a terror to her immediate associates .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 41]: The Normandy nurse , Fran√ßoise , exercised a firmer control over her than any other maid she had ever employed ; hence , Fran√ßoise 's services were retained long after other servants had left their mistress in disgust or fright .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 18]: This distressing form of lunacy seemed also to account for the roving life led by Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 17]: She was proud , with the inbred arrogance of the Junker class from which she sprang .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 19]: She would not endure the scorn , or , mayhap , the sympathy of her friends or dependants .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 21]: Whenever she succumbed to her malady she usually left that place on the first day she was able to travel .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 22]: But the Elmsdale attack , thanks to a limited supply of brandy and Eau de Cologne , was of brief duration .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: Fran√ßoise knew exactly what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 46]: Every drop of alcoholic liquor -- even the methylated spirit used for heating curling-irons -- must be kept out of her mistress 's way during the ensuing twenty-four hours , and a deaf ear turned to frantic pleadings for the smallest quantity of any intoxicant .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 27]: Threats , tears , pitiable requests , physical violence at times , must be disregarded callously ; then would come reaction , followed by extreme exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 28]: Fran√ßoise , despising her German mistress , nevertheless had the avaricious soul of a French peasant , and was amassing a small fortune by attending to her .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 20]: The Misses Walker were so eager to retain their wealthy guest that they pretended absolute ignorance of her condition .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 31]: They succeeded so well -- their own dyspeptic symptoms were described with such ingenuous zeal -- that the lady believed her secret was unknown to the household at The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: Oddly enough , certain faculties remained clear during these attacks .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 32]: She took care that the chauffeur should not see her , and remembered also that young Martin Bolland had conversed with her while she was in the worst paroxysm of drink-craving .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 11]: He was a quick boy , observant beyond his age .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 5]: What did he know ?
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 10]: What wondrous tale had he spread through the village ?
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 28]: A visit to his mother , a meeting with the gossip-loving women sure to be gathered beneath the farmer 's hospitable roof , would tell her all .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 19]: She nerved herself for the ordeal , and approached slowly , fearfully , but outwardly dignified as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 8]: Mrs. Bolland 's hearty greeting was reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 16]: `` Eh , my lady , but ye do look poorly , te be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 33]: I 've bin worritin ' te think ye 've mebbe bin upset by all this racket i ' t ' place , when ye kem here for rest an ' quiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 4]: Mrs. Saumarez smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 15]: `` Oh , no , thank you , Mrs. Bolland , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 38]: `` I can not blame Elmsdale , except , perhaps , that your wonderful air braced up my appetite too greatly , and I had to pay the penalty for so many good things to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 20]: `` Ay , I said so , '' chimed in Mrs. Summersgill , in the accents of deep conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 17]: `` Ower much grub an ' nowt te do is bad for man or beast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 7]: Mrs. Saumarez laughed frankly at that .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 13]: `` In which category do you place me , Mrs. Summersgill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 10]: Meanwhile , her eyes wandered to where Martin stood .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 14]: She was asking herself why the boy should gaze so fixedly at Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 11]: The stout party did not know what a category was .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 9]: She thought it was some species of malady .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 25]: `` Well , ma'am , '' she cried , `` if I was you , I 'd try rabbit meat for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 13]: Eat plenty o ' green stuff an ' shun t ' teapot .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 8]: It 's slow p ` ison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 14]: She stretched out a huge arm and poured out a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 9]: There was a general laugh at this forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 6]: Mrs. Summersgill waved aside criticism .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 6]: `` Ay , ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 37]: she went on , `` it 's easier te preach than te practice , as t ' man said when he fell off a haystack efther another man shooted tiv him te ho 'd fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 6]: Mrs. Saumarez took a seat .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 8]: Thus far , matters had gone well .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 7]: But why did Martin avoid her ?
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 30]: `` Martin , my little friend , '' she said , `` why did you not come in and see me yesterday when you called at The Elms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 14]: `` Miss Walker did not wish it , '' was the candid answer .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 18]: `` I suppose she thought I might be in the way when you were so ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 13]: `` There nivver was sike a bairn , '' protested Martha Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 8]: `` He 's close as wax sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 18]: Not a wud did he say , whether ye were ill or well , Mrs. Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 11]: The lady 's glance rested more graciously on the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 8]: She noticed his bandaged arms and hands .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 8]: `` Have you been scalding yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 3]: Martin reddened .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 22]: It was Ang√®le who answered quickly : `` You were too indisposed last night to hear the story , ch√®re maman .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 7]: It was all over the village .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 9]: Il y a tout le monde qui sait .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 8]: Martin saved Elsie Herbert from a wildcat .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 9]: It almost tore him into little pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 18]: And so the conversation glided safely away from the delicate topic of Mrs. Saumarez 's sudden ailment .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 10]: She praised Martin 's bravery in her polished way .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 41]: She expressed proper horror when the wildcat 's skin was brought in for her edification , and became so lively , so animated , that she actually asked Mrs. Bolland for some tea , notwithstanding Mrs. Summersgill 's earnest warnings .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 6]: She made a hearty meal .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 19]: Fran√ßoise , too , joined in the feast , her homely Norman face perceptibly relaxing its grim vigilance .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 16]: Her mistress was safe now , for a month , two months , perchance six .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 16]: The desire for food was the ultimate sign of complete recovery -- for the time .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 32]: Had Mrs. Saumarez dared ask for a glass of beer from the majestic cask in the corner , Fran√ßoise would have prevented her from taking it , using force if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 21]: The sturdy peasant from Tinchebrai was of stronger moral fiber than the born aristocrat , and her mistress knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 9]: Martin stood somewhat shyly near the broad ingle .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 3]: Ang√®le approached .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 19]: She caressed his lint-wrapped arms , saying sweetly : `` Do they pain you a great deal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: They 're just a bit sore to the touch -- that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 6]: His manner was politely repellant .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 12]: He wished she would not pat him with her nervous fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 8]: She pawed him like a playful cat .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 20]: To-day she wore the beautiful muslin frock he had admired so greatly on the first day of the fair .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 14]: The deep brim of her hat concealed her eyes from all but his .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 12]: `` I am quite jealous of Elsie , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 13]: `` It must be simply lovely to be rescued in that way .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 4]: Poor little me !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 14]: At home nursing mamma , while you were fighting for another girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 10]: `` The thing was not worth so much talk .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 13]: I did nothing that any other boy would not have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 37]: `` My wud , '' cried Mrs. Summersgill suddenly , `` it 'd do your little lass a power o ' good te git some o ' that fat be√§can intiv her , Mrs. Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 26]: From the smoke-blackened rafters over the spacious fireplace were hanging a dozen sides of home-cured bacon , huge toothsome slabs suggesting mounds of luscious rashers .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 42]: The sturdy boy beneath gave proof that there was good nutriment in such ample store , but the girl was so fragile , so fairy-like in her gossamer wings , that she might have been reared on the scent of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 18]: The attention thus drawn to the two caused Martin to flush again , but Ang√®le wheeled round .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 12]: `` Do all pigs grow fat when they are old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 10]: `` Nay , lass , that they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 23]: We feed 'em te mak ' 'em fat while they 're young , but some pigs are skinny ` uns always . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 13]: Mrs. Saumarez smiled indulgently at this passage between two such sharp-tongued combatants .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 5]: Ang√®le 's eyes blazed .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 20]: Fran√ßoise , eating steadily , wondered what had been said to make the women laugh , the child angry .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 11]: Ang√®le caught the astonished expression on the nurse 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 5]: Quickly her mood changed .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 4]: Fran√ßoise sat near .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: She bent over and whispered : `` Tiens , nanna !
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 11]: Voici une vieille truie qui parle comme nous autres ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 12]: Fran√ßoise nearly choked under a combination of protest and bread crumbs .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 23]: Before she could recover her breath at hearing Mrs. Summersgill described `` an old sow who talks like one of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 13]: Ang√®le cried airily to Martin : `` Take me to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 15]: I have n't seen the pony and the dogs for days and days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 6]: He was glad to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 20]: He dreaded Mrs. Summersgill 's mordant humor if a war of wits broke out between her and the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 8]: `` All right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 19]: `` I 'll whistle for Curly and Jim at the back and join you at the gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 8]: But Ang√®le skipped lightly toward her hostess .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 24]: `` Please , Mrs. Bolland , '' she said coaxingly , `` may I not go through the back kitchen , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 9]: `` Sure-ly , honey , '' cried Martha .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 9]: `` One way 's as good as another .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 20]: Martin , tak t ' young leddy anywheres she wants te go , an ' dinnat be so gawky .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 7]: She wo n't bite ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 7]: The two passed into the farmyard .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 34]: `` You see , Martin , '' explained Ang√®le coolly , `` I must find out how Jim Bates and Tommy Beadlam always get hold of you without other people being the wiser .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 13]: Show me the lane and the paddock they tell me of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 17]: `` I do n't see why it should interest you , '' was the ungracious reply .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 5]: `` You dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 17]: Are you angry yet because I would n't let you kiss me the other night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 10]: He was compelled to laugh at the outrageous untruth .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 21]: `` I 'm afraid I spoke very crossly then , '' he admitted , thinking it best to avoid argument .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 5]: I wept for hours .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 8]: My poor little eyes were sore yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 10]: Look and see if they are red now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 7]: They were standing behind the woodpile .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 7]: She thrust her face temptingly near .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 15]: Her beautiful eyes , clear and limpid in their dark depths , blinked saucily .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 27]: Her parted lips revealed two rows of white , even teeth , and her sweet breath mingled with the fragrance that always clung to her garments .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 26]: He experienced a new timidity now ; he was afraid of her in this mood , though secretly flattered by the homage she was paying .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 38]: `` Martin , '' she whispered , `` I like you better than any of the other boys , oh , a great deal better , even though Evelyn Atkinson does say you are a milksop . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 24]: What a hateful word to apply to one whose flesh was scarred by the claws of an infuriated wildcat conquered in fair fight .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 4]: Milksop , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 20]: He knew Ang√®le 's ways well enough by this time to give convincing proof that he was no milksop .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 26]: He placed his bandaged right arm around her waist , boldly drew her toward him , and kissed her three times -- on the lips .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 16]: `` That is more than I ever did to Evelyn Atkinson , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 7]: She returned the embrace with ardor .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 14]: `` Oh , Martin , I do love you , '' she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 17]: `` And you fought for me as well as for Elsie , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 15]: If the thought were grateful to Ang√®le , it stung the boy 's conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 11]: Under what different circumstances had he defended the two girls !
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 13]: He grew scarlet with confusion and sought to unclasp those twining arms .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 10]: `` Someone may see us , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 10]: `` I do n't care , '' she cooed .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 11]: `` Tommy Beadlam is watching us now over the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 7]: Tell him to go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 5]: He wrenched himself free .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 18]: True enough , `` White Head '' was gazing at them , eyes and mouth wide open .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 6]: `` Hello , Tommy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 3]: shouted Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 5]: `` By gum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 3]: gasped Tommy .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 19]: But the spell was broken , and the three joined company to make a tour of the farm .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 12]: Ang√®le was quite unembarrassed and promptly rescued both boys from sheepishness .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 30]: She knew that the observant `` White Head '' would harrow Evelyn Atkinson 's soul with a full description of the tender episode behind the big pile of wood .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 12]: This pleased her more than Martin 's gruff `` spooning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 7]: Inside the farmhouse conversation progressed vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 9]: Mrs. Saumarez joined in the talk with zest .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 9]: The quaint gossip of the women interested her .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 24]: She learnt , seemingly with surprise , that these , her humble sisters , were swayed by emotions near akin to her own .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 27]: Some quiet chronicle of a mother 's loss by the death of a soldier son in far-off South Africa touched a dormant chord in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 14]: `` My husband was killed in that foolish war , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 11]: `` I never think of it without a shudder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 15]: `` I reckon he 'd be an officer , ma'am , '' said Martha .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 20]: `` Yes ; he was shot while leading his regiment in a cavalry charge at the Modder River . ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 16]: `` It 's a dreadful thing , is war , '' observed the bereaved mother .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 35]: `` My lad would n't hurt a fly , yet his capt ` in wrote such a nice letter , sayin ' as how Willie had killed four Boers afore he was struck down .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 20]: T ' capt ` in meant it kindly , no doot , but it gev me small consolation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 11]: `` It is the wives and mothers who suffer most .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 5]: Men like the army .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 15]: I suppose if my child were a boy he would enter the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 13]: `` Thank the Lord , Martin wo n't be a sojer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 4]: cried Martha fervently .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 15]: `` You 're going to make him a minister , are you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 14]: `` Noa , '' said John Bolland 's deep voice from the door .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 8]: `` He 's goin ' to college .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 7]: I 've settled it to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 25]: None present appreciated the force of this statement like Martha , and she resented such a momentous decision being arrived at without her knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 14]: Her head bent , and twitching fingers sought the ends of her apron .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 13]: John strode ponderously forward and placed a huge hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 12]: `` Dinnat be vexed , Martha , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 26]: `` I had n't a chance te speak wi ' ye sen Dr. MacGregor an ' me had a bit crack about t ' lad .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 11]: I did n't need te coom te you for counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 20]: Who knew better 'n me that yer heart was set on Martin bein ' browt up a gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 10]: This recognition of motherly rights somewhat mollified his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 15]: `` Eh , but I 'm main pleased , John , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 11]: `` Yet I 'll be sorry to lose him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 29]: `` Ye 'll wear yer knuckles te t ' bone makkin ' him fine shirts an ' fallals , all t ' same , '' laughed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 29]: Mrs. Saumarez had seen the glint of tears in Mrs. Bolland 's eyes , and came to the rescue with a request for a second cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 13]: `` England is fortunate in being an island , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 16]: `` Now , in my native land every man has to serve in the army .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: It can not be avoided , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 27]: Germany has France on the one hand and Russia on the other , each ready to spring if she relaxes her vigilance for a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 6]: `` Is that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 3]: inquired Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: `` I wunner why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 4]: The lady smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: `` That is a wide political question , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 23]: `` To give one reason out of many , look at our -- at Germany 's thousand miles of open frontier . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 6]: `` Right enough , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 12]: But why is Jarmany buildin ' such a big fleet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 6]: Mrs. Saumarez raised her lorgnette .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 9]: She had not expected so apt a retort .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 14]: `` She is gathering colonies , and already owns a huge mercantile marine .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 10]: Surely , these interests call for adequate protection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 18]: `` Nobody 's threatenin ' 'em , so far as I can see , '' persisted Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 5]: `` Not at present .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 10]: But a wise government looks ahead of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 12]: Germany 's aim is to educate the world by her culture .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 51]: She is doing it already , as any of your own well-informed leading men will tell you ; but the time may come when , in her zeal for advancement , she may tread on somebody 's toes , so she must be prepared , both on land and sea .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 13]: Fortunately , this is the one country she will never attack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 5]: John shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 12]: `` I 'm none so sure , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 31]: `` I hev n't much time fer readin ' , but I did happen t ' other day on a speech by Lord Roberts which med me scrat me head .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 5]: Beg pardon , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 8]: I mean it med me think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 5]: `` Lord Roberts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 5]: began the lady scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 16]: Then she sipped her tea , and the pause gave time to collect her wits .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 20]: `` You must remember that he is a professional soldier , and his views are tainted by militarism . ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 11]: `` Is n't that the trouble i ' Jarmany ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 6]: Mrs. Saumarez drank more tea .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 9]: `` Circumstances alter cases , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 15]: `` The broad fact remains that Germany harbors no evil designs against Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 12]: She believes the world holds plenty of room for both powers .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 16]: And , when all is said and done , why should the two nations quarrel ?
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 6]: They are kith and kin .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 9]: They look at life from the same viewpoints .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 6]: Even their languages are alike .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 31]: Hardly a word in your quaint Yorkshire dialect puzzles me now , because I recognize its source in the older German and in the current speech of our Baltic provinces .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 10]: Germany and England should be friends , not enemies .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 34]: It will be a happy day for England when she ceases worrying about German measures of self-defense , but tries , rather , to imitate her wonderful achievements in every field of science .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 34]: Any woman who uses fabrics need not be told how Germany has taught the whole world how to make aniline dyes , while her chemists are now modernizing the old-time theories of agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 18]: You , Mr. Bolland , as a practical farmer , can surely bear out that contention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 31]: `` Steady on , ma'am , '' said Bolland , leaning forward , with hands on knees , and with eyes fixed on the speaker in an almost disconcerting intensity .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 36]: `` T ' Jarmans hev med all t ' wo ` ld _ buy _ their dyes , but there hez n't been much _ teachin ' _ , as I 've heerd tell of .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 30]: As for farmin ' , they coom here year after year an ' snap up our best stock i ' horses an ' cattle te improve their own breeds .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 9]: _ I _ ca n't grummel at that .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 21]: They compete wi ' t ' Argentine an ' t ' United States , an ' up go my prices .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 25]: Still , I do think our government is te blame for lettin ' our finest stallions an ' brood mares leave t ' country .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 5]: They differ frae cattle .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 20]: They 're bowt for use i ' t ' army , an ' we 're bein ' drained dhry .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 6]: That 's bad for us .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 10]: An ' why are they doin ' it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 9]: Mrs. Saumarez pushed away her cup and saucer .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 19]: She laughed nervously , with the air of one who had gone a little further than was intended .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 6]: `` There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 4]: she cried pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 27]: `` I am only trying to show you Germany 's open aims , but some Englishmen persist in attributing a hostile motive to her every act .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 23]: You see , I know Germany , and few people here trouble either to learn the language or visit the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 12]: `` Likely not , ma'am , '' was the ironical answer .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 37]: `` Mr. Pickerin ' went te some ple√§ce -- Bremen , I think they call it -- two year sen this July , te see a man who 'd buy every Cleveland bay he could offer .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 67]: George had just been med an officer i ' t ' Territorials -- which meant a week 's swankin ' aboot i ' uniform at a camp , an ' givin ' his men free beer an ' pork pies te attend a few drills -- an ' he was fule enough te carry a valise wi ' his rank an ' regiment painted on it .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 13]: Why , they watched him like a cat watchin ' a mouse .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 29]: He could n't eat a bite or tak a pint o ' their light beer that a ` tec was n't sittin ' at t ' next table .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 6]: They fairly chased him away .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 23]: Even his friend , the hoss-buyer , got skeered at last , an ' advised him te quit te avoid arrest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 23]: `` That must have been a wholly exceptional case , '' said Mrs. Saumarez , speaking in a tone of utter indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 28]: `` Had _ I _ known him , for instance , and given him a letter of introduction , he would have been welcomed , not suspected .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 8]: By the way , how is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 13]: I hear -- '' The conversation was steered into a safer channel .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 15]: They were discussing the wounded man 's condition when Mrs. Saumarez 's car passed .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 25]: The door stood open , so they all noted that the vehicle was white with dust , but the chauffeur was the sole occupant .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 9]: `` Her ladyship '' was pleased to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 21]: `` It is a new car , so Fritz took it for a long spin to-day , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 22]: `` You will understand , Mr. Bolland , that the engine has to find itself , as the phrase goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 12]: `` Expensive work , ma'am , '' smiled John , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 24]: `` An ' now , good folk , '' he continued , `` whe√§ 's coomin ' te t ' love feast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 6]: There was a general movement .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: The assembly dear to old-time Methodism appealed to the majority of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: Mrs. Saumarez raised her lorgnette once more .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 8]: `` What is a love feast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 22]: `` It 's a gathering o ' members o ' our communion , ma'am , '' was Bolland 's ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 8]: `` May I come , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 10]: Instantly a rustle of surprise swept through her hearers .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 13]: Even John Bolland was so taken aback that he hesitated to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 9]: But the lady seemed to be in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 11]: `` I really mean it , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 34]: `` I have a spare hour , and , as I do n't care for dinner to-night , I 'll be most pleased to attend -- that is , if I may ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 5]: The farmer came nearer .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 29]: He looked at the bulbous eyelids , the too-evenly tinted skin , the turgid veins in the brilliant eyes , and perhaps saw more than Mrs. Saumarez dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 17]: `` Happen it 'll be an hour well spent , ma'am , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 37]: `` Admission is by membership ticket , but t ' minister gev ' me a few ` permits ' for outside friends , an ' I 'll fill yan in for ye wi ' pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 29]: He produced some slips of paper bearing the written words , `` Admit Brother '' or `` Sister -- , '' and signed , `` Eli Todd . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 14]: With a stubby pencil he scrawled `` Saumarez '' in a blank space .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 14]: The lady thanked him , and gave some instructions in French to Fran√ßoise .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 24]: Five minutes later `` Sister Saumarez , '' escorted by `` Brother '' and `` Sister '' Bolland , entered the village meetinghouse .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 20]: The appearance of a fashionable dame in their midst created a mild sensation among the small congregation already collected .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 15]: They were mostly old or middle-aged people ; youngsters were conspicuous by their absence .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 33]: There was a dance that night in a tent erected in a field close to the chapel ; in the boxing booth the semi-final round would be fought for the Elmsdale championship .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 13]: Against these rival attractions the Gospel was not a `` draw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 22]: Gradually the spacious but bare room -- so unlike all that Mrs. Saumarez knew of churches -- became fairly well filled .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 20]: As the church clock chimed the half-hour after six the Rev. Eli Todd came in from a neighboring classroom .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 23]: This was the preacher with the powerful voice , but his bell-like tones were subdued and reverent enough in the opening prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 14]: He uttered a few earnest sentences and quickly evoked responses from the people .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 10]: The first time John Bolland cried `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 4]: Mrs. Saumarez started .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 16]: She thought her friend had made a mistake , and her nerves were on edge .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 11]: But the next period produced a hearty `` Hallelujah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 10]: and others joined in with `` Glory be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 8]: `` Thy will , O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 4]: and kindred ejaculations .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 6]: One incident absolutely amazed her .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 9]: The minister was reciting the Lord 's Prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 13]: `` Give us this day our daily bread , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 8]: `` And no baccy , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 10]: growled a voice from the rear of the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 20]: The minister had a momentary difficulty in concluding the petition , and a broad grin ran through the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 31]: Mrs. Saumarez learned subsequently that the interrupter was a converted poacher , who abandoned his pipe , together with gun and beer jug , `` when he found Christ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 18]: Eli Todd was a confirmed smoker , and the two were ever at variance on the point .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 43]: All stood up when their pastor gave out the opening verses of a hymn : _ O what a joyful meeting there , In robes of white arrayed ; Palms in our hands we all shall bear And crowns upon our heads .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 30]: _ The joyous energy of his declamation , the no less eager volume of sound that arose from the congregation , atoned for any deficiencies of meter or rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 12]: The village worshipers lost themselves in the influence of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 36]: With spiritual vision they saw the last great meeting , and thundered vociferously the closing lines of the chorus : _ And then we shall in Heaven reign , And never , never part again .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 25]: _ `` Grace before meat '' was sung , and , to Mrs. Saumarez 's great discomfiture , bread and water were passed round .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 28]: Each one partook save herself ; Bolland , with real tact , missed her in handing the tray and pitcher to the other occupants of their pew .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 17]: `` Grace after meat '' followed , and forthwith Eli Todd began to deliver an address .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 20]: His discourse was simple and well reasoned , dealing wholly with the sustenance derived from God 's saving spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 34]: It may be that the unexpected presence of a stranger like Mrs. Saumarez exercised a slightly unnerving influence , as he spoke more seriously and with less dramatic intensity than was his wont .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 9]: Suddenly he rebelled against this sensation of restraint .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 44]: Changing , with the skill of a born revivalist , from the rounded periods of ordinary English to the homely vernacular of the district , he thundered out : `` There 's noa cittidell o ' sin ` at God can not destroy .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 31]: Ay , friends , t ' sword o ' t ' Spirit s ` all oppen a way through walls o ' brass an ' iron yats -LRB- gates -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 10]: We√§n ' t ye jine His conquerin ' army ?
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 9]: He 's willin ' te list ye noo .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 35]: There 's none o ' yer short service whilst ye de√§ t ' Lord 's work -- it 's for ivver an ' ivver , an ' yer pension is life ivverlastin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 39]: And so the curious service went to its end , which came not until various members of the congregation made public confession of faith , personal statements which often consisted of question and answer between pastor and penitent .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 6]: It was a strange interrogatory .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 29]: Eli Todd had a ready quip , a quick appreciation , an emphatic or amusing disclaimer , for each and every avowal of broad-minded Christianity or intolerant views .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 9]: For these dalesfolk did not all think alike .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 20]: Some were inclined to damn others who did not see through the myopic lenses of their own spiritual spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 10]: The preacher would have none of this exclusive righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 16]: As he said , in his own strenuous way : `` The Lord is ivverywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 12]: He is n't a prisoner i ' this little room te-night .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 16]: He 's yonder i ' t ' street amang t ' organs an ' shows .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 19]: He 's yonder i ' t ' tent where foolish youths an ' maidens can not see Him .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 22]: If ye seek Him ye 'll find Him , ay , in the abodes of sin and the palaces of wantonness .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 20]: No door can be closed to His saving mercy , no heart too hardened to resist His love . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 28]: As it happened , his glance fell on Mrs. Saumarez as he uttered the concluding words , and his voice unconsciously tuned itself to suit her understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 21]: She dropped her eyes , and the observant minister thought that she was reading a personal meaning into his address .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 27]: At once he began the `` Doxology , '' which was sung with great fervor , and the love feast broke up after a brief prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: Mr. Todd overtook Mrs. Saumarez on the green .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 11]: Bolland and his wife were escorting her to The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 15]: `` I hope you liked the service , madam , '' he said politely .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 12]: `` I thought it most interesting , '' she answered slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 9]: `` I think I shall come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 18]: He took off his hat and assured her that she would always be welcome at Bethel Chapel .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 26]: He , worthy man , no less than the Bollands , could little guess this woman 's motives in thus currying favor with the villagers .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 30]: Had an angel from Heaven laid bare her intent , they would scarce have believed , or , if conviction came , they would only have deemed her mad .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 10]: A breathless Fran√ßoise met her mistress at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 18]: Ang√®le was not to be found anywhere , and it was so late , nearly eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 7]: Nor was Martin to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 10]: Madam would remember , they had gone off together .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 10]: Mrs. Saumarez explained what all the gesticulation was about .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 18]: `` If she 's wi ' Martin , she 'll be all right , '' said Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 16]: `` He 'll bring her yam afore ye git yer things off , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 36]: Ang√®le had discovered that Elsie Herbert would be at the church bazaar that evening , and planned the ramble with Martin so that the vicar 's daughter might meet them together on the high road .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 45]: It delighted her to see the only rival she feared flash a quick side glance as she bowed smilingly and passed on , for Mr. Herbert did not wholly approve of Ang√®le , so Elsie thought it best not to stop for a chat .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 12]: Martin , too , was annoyed as he doffed his cap .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 10]: He thought Elsie would surely ask how he was .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 19]: Moreover , those hot kisses were burning yet on his lips ; the memory made him profoundly uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 18]: When he left Ang√®le at the gate she did not suggest a rendezvous at a later hour .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 30]: Not only would it be useless , but she had seen Frank Beckett-Smythe earlier in the day , and he said there was a dinner party at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: Perhaps he might be able to slip away unnoticed about nine .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 24]: CHAPTER XIII A DYING DEPOSITION Before Mr. Beckett-Smythe sat down to dinner that evening a very unpleasant duty had been thrust on him .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 17]: The superintendent of police drove over from Nottonby to show him the county analyst 's report .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 26]: Divested of technicalities , this document proved that George Pickering 's dangerous condition arose from blood poisoning caused by a stab from a contaminated knife .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 54]: It was admitted that a wound inflicted by a rusty pitchfork might have had equally serious results , but the analysis of matter obtained from both instruments proved conclusively that the knife alone was impregnated with the putrid germs found in the blood corpuscles , which also contained an undue proportion of alcohol .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 14]: Moreover , Dr. MacGregor 's statement on the one vital point was unanswerable .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 21]: Pickering was suffering from an incised wound which could not have been inflicted by the rounded prongs of a fork .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 16]: The doctor was equally emphatic in his belief that the injured man would succumb speedily .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 21]: In the face of these documents it was necessary that George Pickering 's depositions should be taken by a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 19]: Most unwillingly , Mr. Beckett-Smythe accompanied the superintendent to the `` Black Lion Hotel '' for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 23]: They entered the sick room about the time that Mrs. Saumarez was crossing the green on her way to the Methodist Chapel .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 19]: A glance at Pickering 's face showed that the doctor had not exaggerated the gravity of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 17]: He was deathly pale , save for a number of vivid red spots on his skin .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 6]: His eyes shone with fever .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 23]: Were not his malady identified , the unskilled observer might conclude that he was suffering from a severe attack of German measles .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 9]: Betsy was there , and the prim nurse .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 21]: The contrast between the two women was almost as startling as the change for the worse in Pickering 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 18]: The nurse , strictly professional in deportment , paid heed to naught save the rules of treatment .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 40]: The word `` hospital , '' `` certificate , '' `` method , '' shrieked silently from her flowing coif and list slippers , from the clinical thermometer on the table , and the temperature chart on the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 14]: Poor Betsy was sitting by the bedside , holding her lover 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 42]: She was smiling wistfully , striving to chatter in cheerful strain , yet all the time she wanted to wail her despair , to petition on her knees that her crime might be avenged on herself , not on its victim .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 35]: When the magistrate stepped gingerly forward , Pickering turned querulously to see who the visitor was , for the nurse had nodded permission to enter when the two men looked through the half-open door .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 17]: `` Oh , it 's you , squire , '' he said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 9]: `` I thought it might be MacGregor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 10]: `` How are you feeling now , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 4]: `` Pretty sick .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 9]: I suppose you 've heard the verdict ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 12]: `` The doctor says you are in a bad state . ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 7]: `` Booked , squire , booked !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 5]: And no return ticket .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 5]: I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 31]: I 've made all arrangements -- that is , I 'll have a free mind this time to-morrow -- and then , well , I 'll face the music . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 8]: He caught sight of the police officer .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 5]: `` Hello , Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 3]: You there ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 9]: Come for my last dying depositions , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 3]: All right .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 3]: Fire away !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 11]: Betsy , my lass , leave us for a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 5]: The nurse can stay .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 7]: The more witnesses the merrier . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 3]: Betsy arose .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 13]: There was no fear in her eyes now -- only dumb agony .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 7]: She walked steadily from the room .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 39]: While Mr. Beckett-Smythe was thanking Providence under his breath that a most distressing task was thus being made easy for him , they all heard a dreadful sob from the exterior landing , followed by a heavy thud .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 5]: The nurse hurried out .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 4]: Betsy had fainted .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 11]: With a painful effort Pickering raised himself on one arm .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 9]: His forced gayety gave place to loud-voiced violence .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: `` Confound you all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 16]: `` Why come here to frighten the poor girl 's life out of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 25]: He cursed both the magistrate and Superintendent Jonas by name ; were he able to rise he would break their necks down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 12]: The policeman crept out on tip-toe ; Mr. Beckett-Smythe sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 8]: Pickering stormed away until the nurse returned .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 10]: `` Miss Thwaites is better , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 22]: `` She was overcome by the long strain , but she is with her sister now , and quite recovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 25]: Betsy was crying her heart out in Kitty 's arms : fortunately , the sounds of her grief were shut out from their ears .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 8]: Jonas came back and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 26]: The doomed man sank to the pillow and growled sullenly : `` Now , get on with your business , and be quick over it .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 16]: I 'll not have Betsy worried again while I have breath left to protest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 20]: `` I am , indeed , very sorry to disturb you , George , '' said the magistrate quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: `` It is a thankless office for an old friend .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 5]: Try and calm yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 20]: I do not ask your forbearance toward myself and Mr. Jonas , but there are tremendous issues at stake .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 14]: For your own sake you must help us to face this ordeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 8]: `` Oh , go ahead , squire .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 19]: My bark is worse than my bite -- not that I have much of either in me now .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 8]: If I spoke roughly , forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 11]: I could n't bear to hear yon lass suffering . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 35]: Thinking it best to avoid further delay , Mr. Beckett-Smythe nodded to the police officer , who drew forward a small table , which , with writing materials , he placed before the magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 9]: A foolscap sheet bore already some written words .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 21]: The magistrate bent over it , and said , in a voice shaken with emotion : `` Listen , George .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 56]: I have written here : ` I , George Pickering , being of sound mind , but believing myself to be in danger of death , solemnly take oath and depose as follows ' : Now , I want you to tell me , in your own words , what took place last Monday night .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 11]: You are going to the awful presence of your Creator .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 33]: You must tell the truth , fully and fearlessly , not striving to determine the course of justice by your own judgment , but leaving matters wholly in the hands of God .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 26]: You are conscious of what you are doing , fully sensible that you will soon be called on to meet One who knoweth all things .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 24]: I hope , I venture to pray , that you will give testimony in all sincerity and righteousness ... I am ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 9]: Pickering heard this solemn injunction with due gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 17]: His features were composed , his eyes fixed on the distant landscape through the open window .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 40]: No disturbing noise reached him save the lowing of cattle and the far-off rattle of a reaping machine , for the police had ordered the removal of the shooting gallery and roundabout to the other end of the green .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 28]: He remained silent so long that the two men glanced at him anxiously , but were reassured by the belief that he was only collecting his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 7]: Indeed , it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 30]: He was striving to bridge that dark chasm on whose perilous verge he tottered -- striving to frame an excuse that would not be uttered by his mortal lips .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 5]: At last he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 42]: `` On Monday night , about five minutes past ten , I met Kitty Thwaites , by appointment , at the wicket gate which opens into the garden from the bowling green of the ` Black Lion Hotel , ' Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 7]: We walked down the garden together .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 56]: We were talking and laughing about the antics of a groom in this hotel , a fellow named Fred -- I do not know his surname -- who was jealous of me because I was in the habit of chaffing Kitty and placing my arm around her waist if I encountered her on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 21]: This man Fred , I believe , endeavored to pay attentions to Kitty , which she always refused to encourage .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 24]: Kitty and I stopped at the foot of the garden beneath a pear tree which stands in the boundary fence of the paddock .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 24]: `` I had my arm around her neck , but was only playing the fool , which Kitty knew as well as I .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 31]: There was a bright moon , and , although almost invisible ourselves in the shadow of the hedge and tree , we could see clearly into both paddock and garden .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: My back was toward the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 11]: Suddenly , we heard someone running down the gravel path .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 28]: I turned and saw that it was Betsy Thwaites , Kitty 's sister , a girl whom I believed to be then in a situation at Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 23]: I had promised to marry Betsy , and was naturally vexed at being caught in an apparently compromising attitude with her sister .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 8]: Betsy had a knife in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 10]: I could see it glittering in the moonlight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 3]: He paused .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 6]: He was corpse-like in color .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 17]: The red spots on his face were darker than before by contrast with the wan cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 15]: He motioned to the nurse , who gave him a glass of barley water .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 7]: He emptied it at a gulp .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 13]: Catching Mr. Beckett-Smythe 's mournful glance , he smiled with ghastly pleasantry .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 14]: `` It sounds like a coroner 's inquest , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 42]: Then , while his eyes roved incessantly from the face of the policeman to that of the magistrate , he continued : `` I imagined that Betsy meant to do her sister some harm , so sprang forward to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 23]: Then I saw that she was minded to attack me , for she screamed out : ` You have ruined my life .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 13]: I 'll take care you do not ruin Kitty 's . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 11]: The words , of course , were spoken very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 10]: They alternated with the steady scratching of the pen .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 8]: Others in the room were pallid now .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 12]: Even the rigid nurse yielded to the excitement of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 19]: Her linen bands fluttered and her bosom rose and fell with the restraint she imposed on her breathing .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 10]: George Pickering suddenly became the most composed person present .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 10]: His hearers were face to face with a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 11]: After all , did he mean to tell the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 38]: Ah , it was well that his affianced wife was weeping in an adjoining room , that her soul was not pierced by the calm recital which would condemn her to prison , perchance to the scaffold .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 11]: `` Her cry warned me , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 9]: `` I knew she could not hurt me .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 15]: I was a strong and active man , she a weak , excited woman .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 23]: She was very near , advancing down the path which runs close to the dividing hedge of the garden and the stackyard .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 16]: To draw her away from Kitty , I ran toward this hedge and jumped over .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 5]: It was dark there .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 7]: I missed my footing and stumbled .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 9]: I felt something run into my left breast .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 9]: It was the prong of a pitchfork . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 4]: The pen ceased .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 16]: A low gasp of relief came from the nurse , for she was a woman .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 8]: The superintendent looked gravely at the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 17]: But the magistrate faltered : `` George -- remember -- you are a dying man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 6]: Pickering again lifted his body .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 24]: His face was convulsed with a spasm of pain , but the strong voice cried fearlessly : `` Write what I have said .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 9]: I 'll swear it with my last breath .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 12]: I 'll tell the same story to either God or devil .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 16]: Write , I say , or shall I finish it with my own hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 16]: They thought that by some superhuman effort he would rise forthwith to reach the table .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 11]: The nurse , the policeman , leaped to restrain him .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 6]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe was greatly agitated .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 12]: `` If I can not persuade you -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 7]: `` Persuade me to do what ?
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 15]: To bolster up a lying charge against the woman I am going to marry ?
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 12]: By the Lord , do you think I 'm mad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 4]: They released him .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 9]: The set intensity of his face was terrible .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 20]: It is hard to say what awful power could have changed George Pickering 's purpose in that supreme moment .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 54]: Yet he clenched his hands in the bedclothes , as if he would choke some mocking fiend that grinned at him , and his voice was hoarse as he murmured : `` Oh , man , if you have a heart , end your inquisition , or I 'll die too soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 8]: Again the pen resumed its monotonous scrape .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 5]: It paused at last .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 7]: The fateful words were on record .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 7]: `` And then what happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 8]: The magistrate 's question was judicially cold .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 27]: He held strong convictions regarding the deeper mysteries of life ; his faculties were benumbed by this utter defiance of all that he believed most firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 26]: `` I said something , swore very likely , and staggered into the moonlight , at the same time tearing the fork from my breast .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 10]: Betsy saw what I was doing , and screamed .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 35]: I managed to get over the hedge again , and she ran away in mortal fright , for I had pulled open my waistcoat , and she could see the blood on my shirt .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 13]: She fell as she ran , and cut herself with the knife .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 19]: By that time Kitty had reached the hotel , screaming wildly that Betsy was trying to murder me .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 5]: Betsy never touched me .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 13]: The wound I am suffering from was inflicted by myself , accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 36]: It was not caused by the knife , as is shown by the fact that I am dying of blood poisoning , while Betsy 's cuts are healing and have left her unharmed otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 16]: His hearers were greatly perturbed , but they knew that further protest would be unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 10]: And there was an even greater shock in store .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 22]: Pickering turned in the bed and poised his pain-racked frame so as to reach the manuscript placed before him for signature .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 15]: With unwavering hand he added the words : `` So help me God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 6]: Then he wrote his name .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 24]: `` Now , sign that , all of you , as witnesses , '' he commanded , and they did not gainsay him .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 4]: It was useless .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 8]: Why prolong his torture and their own ?
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 10]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe handed the sheets of paper to Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 26]: He seemed inclined to leave the room without another spoken word , but humane impulse was stronger than dogma ; he held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 11]: `` Good-by , George , '' he said brokenly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 9]: ` Judge not , ' it is written .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 29]: Let my farewell be a prayer that you may die peacefully and painlessly , if , indeed , God in His mercy does not grant your recovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 5]: `` Good-by , squire .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 6]: You 've got two sons .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 14]: Find 'em plenty of work ; they 'll have less time for mischief .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 9]: Damn it all , hark to that reaper !
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 10]: It 'll soon be time to rouse the cubs .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 10]: I 'll miss the next hunt breakfast , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 8]: Well , good luck to you all !
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: I 've had my last gallop .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 4]: Good-by , Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 13]: Do you remember the fight we had that morning with the poachers ?
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 3]: Look here !
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 23]: When you meet Rabbit Jack , tell him to go to Stockwell for a sovereign and swim in beer for a week .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 6]: Nurse , where 's Betsy ?
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 9]: I want her before it is dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 28]: And in a few minutes Betsy , the forlorn , was bending over him and whispering : `` I 'll do it for your sake , George !
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 18]: But , oh , it will be hard to face everybody with a lie in my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 8]: The hand that struck you should wither .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 11]: Indeed , indeed , I shall suffer worse than death .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 19]: If the Lord took pity on me , He would let me be the first to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 14]: He stroked her hair gently , and there were tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 9]: `` Never cry about spilt milk , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 13]: At best , or worst , the whole thing was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 8]: Come , now , no more weeping .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 10]: Sit down there and write what I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 20]: I can remember every word , and Kitty and you must just fit in your stories to suit mine .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 5]: Stockwell will defend you .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 13]: He 's a smart chap , and you need have no fear .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 17]: Bless your heart , you 'll be twice married before you know where you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 4]: She obeyed him .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 8]: With careful accuracy he repeated the deposition .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 8]: He rehearsed the evidence she would give .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 23]: When the nurse came in , he bade her angrily to leave them alone , but recalled her in the next breath .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 4]: He wanted Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 8]: She , too , must be coached .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 13]: At his command she had placed the fork where it was found .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 10]: But she must learn her story with parrot-like accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 11]: There must be no contradiction in the sisters ' evidence .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 18]: Martin was eating his supper when Mrs. Bolland , bustling about the kitchen , made a discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 13]: `` I must be fair wool-gatherin ' , '' she said crossly .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 23]: `` Here 's a little pile o ' handkerchiefs browt by Dr. MacGregor , an ' I clean forgot all about 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 23]: Martin , it 's none ower le√§t , an ' ye can bide i ' bed i ' t ' mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 17]: Just run along te t ' vicarage wi ' these , there 's a good lad .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 9]: They 'll mebbe be wantin ' 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 16]: He hailed the errand not the less joyfully that it led him through the fair .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 6]: But he did not loiter .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 29]: Perhaps he gazed with longing eyes at its vanishing glories , for some of the showmen were packing up in disgust , but he reached the vicarage quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 29]: It lay nearer the farm than The Elms , and , like that pretentious mansion , was shrouded from the highroad by leafy trees and clusters of laurels .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 9]: A broad drive led to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 17]: The night was drawing in rapidly , and the moon would not rise until eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 32]: In the curving avenue it was pitch-dark , but a cheerful light shone from the drawing-room , and through an open French window he could see Elsie bending over a book .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 18]: She was not deeply interested , judging by the listless manner in which she turned the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 41]: She was leaning with her elbows on the table , resting one knee on a chair , and the attitude revealed a foot and ankle quite as gracefully proportioned as Ang√®le 's elegant limbs , though Elsie was more robust .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 20]: Hearing the boy 's firm tread on the graveled approach , she straightened herself and ran to the window .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 6]: `` Who is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 6]: Martin stepped into the light .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 8]: `` Oh , it 's you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 6]: `` Yes , Miss Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 7]: Mother sent me with these . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 8]: He held out the parcel of linen .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 8]: she asked , extending a hesitating hand .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 13]: `` It is perfectly harmless , if you stroke it gently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 15]: She could see the mischief dancing in his eyes , and grabbed the package .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 4]: Then she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 4]: `` Our handkerchiefs !
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 19]: It was very kind of Mrs. Bolland -- '' `` I think Dr. MacGregor had them washed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 15]: This puzzled her , but a more personal topic was present in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 13]: `` I saw you a little while ago , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 18]: `` You were engaged , or I would have asked you if you were recovering all right .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 12]: Your hands and arms are yet bound up , I see .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: Do they hurt you much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 5]: Not a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 19]: He felt absurdly tongue-tied , but bravely continued : `` I was told to take Miss Saumarez home .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 11]: That is how you happened to meet us together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 12]: `` Indeed , '' she said , drawing back a little .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 14]: Her tone conveyed that any explanation of Miss Saumarez 's companionship was unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 14]: No other attitude could have set Martin 's wits at work more effectually .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 8]: He , too , retreated a pace .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 14]: `` I 'm very sorry if I disturbed you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 13]: `` I was going to ring for one of the servants . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 3]: She tittered .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 9]: `` Then I am glad you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 16]: They are both out , and auntie would have wondered who our late visitor was .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 8]: She has just gone to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 14]: `` But is n't your -- is n't Mr. Herbert at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 9]: `` No ; he is at the bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 14]: He asked me to sit up until one of the maids returns . ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 6]: Again she approached the window .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 7]: One foot rested on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 13]: `` I 've been reading ` Rokeby , ' '' ventured Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 7]: `` Do you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 12]: `` It must be very interesting when you know the place .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 28]: Just imagine how nice it would be if Sir Walter had seen Elmsdale and written about the moor , and the river , and the ghylls . ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 15]: `` Do you think he would have found a wildcat in Thor ghyll ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 5]: `` I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 14]: It might have spoiled the verse ; and Thor ghyll is beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: `` I 'll never forget that cat .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 6]: I can see it yet .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 10]: How its eyes blazed when it sprang at me !
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 16]: Oh , I do n't know how you dared seize it in your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 20]: She was outside the window now , standing on a strip of turf that ran between house and drive .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 19]: `` I did n't give a second thought to it , '' said Martin in his offhand way .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 15]: `` I can never thank you enough for saving me , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 12]: `` Then I 'll tell you what , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 27]: `` To make quite sure you wo n't forget , I 'll try and persuade mother to have the skin made into a muff for you .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 16]: One of the men is curing it , with spirits of ammonia and saltpeter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 14]: `` Do you think I may need to have my memory jogged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 10]: `` People forget things , '' he said airily .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 10]: `` Besides , I 'm going away to school .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 13]: When I come back you 'll be a grown-up young lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 10]: `` I 'm nearly as tall as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 7]: `` Indeed you are not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 16]: `` Well , I 'm much taller than Ang√®le Saumarez , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 12]: `` There 's no comparison between you in any respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 20]: And this young spark three short hours ago , behind the woodpile , had gazed into Ang√®le 's eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 18]: `` Do you remember -- we were talking about her when that creature flew at me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 11]: It was odd how Ang√®le 's name kept cropping up .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 6]: The church clock struck nine .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 6]: They listened to the chimes .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 11]: Neither spoke until the tremulous booming of the bell ceased .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid I must be going , '' said Martin , without budging an inch .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 16]: `` Did you -- did you -- find any difficulty -- in opening the gate ?
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 5]: It is rather stiff .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 10]: And your poor hands must be so sore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 13]: From excessive politeness , or shyness , Elsie 's tongue tripped somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 11]: `` It was a bit stiff , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 11]: `` I had to reach up , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 15]: `` Then I think I ought to come and open it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 11]: `` But you will be afraid to return alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 3]: `` Afraid !
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 4]: Of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 24]: `` I really do n't know , '' he said , `` but I thought girls were always scared in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 8]: `` Then I am an exception . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 9]: She cast a backward glance into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 7]: `` The lamp is quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 9]: It will not take me a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 8]: They walked together down the short avenue .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 6]: The gate was standing open .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 14]: `` Really , '' laughed Martin , `` I had quite forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 10]: `` So boys have weak memories , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 7]: `` Of gates , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 10]: `` Well , now , I must be off .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 9]: Good-night , and thank you so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 6]: She held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 8]: He took it in both of his .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 17]: `` I do hope Mr. Herbert will ask me to another picnic , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 9]: A boy on a bicycle rode past slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 11]: Instinctively , they shrank into the shadow of a tree .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 8]: `` Was n't that Frank Beckett-Smythe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 18]: whispered Elsie , forgetting to withdraw her imprisoned hand , and turning a startled face to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 11]: `` Where can he be going at this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 23]: Martin guessed accurately , but sheer chivalry prevented him from saying more than : `` To the fair , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 10]: `` At this hour ; after nine o'clock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 3]: `` S-s-h .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 6]: He 's coming back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 4]: She drew closer .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 15]: There was an air of mystery in this nocturnal bicycle ride that induced bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 10]: Martin 's right hand still inclosed the girl 's .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 26]: What more natural than that his left arm should go around her waist , merely to emphasize the need for caution , concealment , secrecy ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 13]: Most certainly his knowledge of womankind was striding onward in seven-leagued boots .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 12]: The trot of a horse sounded sharply on the hard road .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 10]: It was being ridden by someone in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 22]: The young scion of the Hall , who appeared to be killing time , inclined his machine to the opposite hedge .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 13]: But the rider pulled up with the skill of a practiced horseman .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 17]: Even in the dim light the boy and girl recognized one of Mr. Beckett-Smythe 's grooms .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 9]: `` Is that you , Master Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 5]: they heard him say .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 5]: `` Hello , Williams !
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 5]: What 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 7]: `` What 's up , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 7]: T ' Squire has missed ye .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 7]: A bonny row there 'll be .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 12]: Ye mun skip back lively , let me tell ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 7]: `` Oh , the deuce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 10]: `` Better lose nae mair time , Master Frank .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 15]: I 'll say I found ye yon side o ' T ' Elms . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 12]: `` What has The Elms got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 4]: The man grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 15]: `` Noo , Master Frank , just mount an ' be off in front .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 16]: T ' Squire thinks ye 're efther that black-eyed lass o ' Mrs. Saumarez 's .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 8]: Do n't try an ' humbug him .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 23]: He telt me te lay my huntin ' - crop across yer shoulders , but that 's none o ' my business .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 5]: Off ye go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 11]: The heir , sulky and in deep tribulation , obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 10]: They heard the horse 's hoofbeats dying away rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 11]: Elsie , an exceedingly nice-mannered girl , was essentially feminine .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 24]: The episode thrilled her , and pleased her , too , in some indefinable way , for her companion was holding her tightly .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 6]: `` Just fancy that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 11]: `` Oh , he will only get a hiding . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 14]: `` But , surely , he could not expect to meet Ang√®le ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 6]: `` It looks like it .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 9]: But why should we trouble about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 7]: `` I think it is horrid .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 6]: But I must be going .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 5]: Good-night -- Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 10]: He felt a gentle effort to loosen his clasp .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Elsie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 6]: Their faces were very close .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 20]: Assuredly , the boy must have been a trifle light-headed that day , for he bent and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 8]: She tore herself from the encircling arm .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 5]: Her cheeks were burning .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 12]: At a little distance -- a few feet -- she halted .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 6]: `` How dare you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 8]: He came to her with hands extended .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 13]: `` Forgive me , Elsie ; I could n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 13]: `` You must never , never do such a thing again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 6]: He had nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 4]: `` Promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 13]: she cried , but her voice was less emphatic than she imagined .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 14]: `` I wo n't , '' he said , and caught her arm .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 6]: `` You -- wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 9]: How can you say such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 6]: `` Because I like you .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 18]: I have known you for years , though we never spoke to each other until yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 5]: `` Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 4]: This is terrible !
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 5]: You frightened me so !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 11]: I hope I did n't hurt your poor arms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 10]: `` The pain was awful , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 16]: The girl 's heart was beating so frantically that she could almost hear its pulsations .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 15]: The white bandages on Martin 's wrists and hands aroused a tumult of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 49]: The scene in the ghyll flashed before her eyes ; she saw again the wild struggles of the snarling , tearing , biting animal , the boy 's cool daring and endurance until he crushed the raging thing 's life out of it and flung it away contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 14]: An impulse came to her , and it was not to be repelled .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 18]: She placed both hands on his shoulders and kissed him , quite fearlessly , on the lips .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 37]: `` I think I owed you that , '' she said , with a little sob , and then ran away in good earnest , never turning her head until she was safe within the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 19]: Martin , his brain in a whirl and his blood on fire , closed the gate for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 19]: When the vicar came , half an hour later , his daughter was busy over the same book .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 5]: `` What , Elsie !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 8]: None of the maids home yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 7]: `` No , father , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 7]: But Martin Bolland brought these . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 6]: `` Oh , our handkerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 6]: What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 7]: `` Nothing -- of any importance .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 20]: I understood that Dr. MacGregor caused the linen to be washed , but forgot to ask him why . ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 26]: `` Practically all , except that his arms and hands are all bound up , so I went with him as far as the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 7]: It is stiff , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 12]: And -- yes -- he has been reading ` Rokeby . '
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 5]: He likes it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 6]: The vicar filled his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 7]: He had had a trying day .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 11]: `` Martin is a fine lad , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 12]: `` I hope John Bolland will see fit to educate him .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 16]: Such a youngster should not be allowed to vegetate in a village like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 8]: said Elsie , `` that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 11]: He told me he was going away to school . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 4]: `` Capital ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 4]: agreed the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 7]: `` Out of evil comes good .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: It required an earthquake to move a man like Bolland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 10]: CHAPTER XIV THE STORM On the morrow rain fell .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 24]: At first the village regarded the break in the weather as a thunderstorm , and harvesters looked to an early resumption of work .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 16]: `` A sup o ' wet 'll do nowt any harm , '' they said .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 36]: But a steadily declining `` glass '' and a continuous downpour that lost nothing in volume as the day wore caused increasing headshakes , anxious frowns , revilings not a few of the fickle elements .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 7]: The moorland becks became raging torrents .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 35]: The gorged river rose until all the low-lying land was flooded , hundreds of pounds ' worth of corn in stook swept away , and all standing crops were damaged to an enormous extent .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 21]: Cattle , sheep , poultry , even a horse or two , were caught by the rushing waters and drowned .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 13]: A bridge became blocked by floating debris and crumbled before the flood .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 68]: Three men were standing on the structure , idly watching the articles whirling past in the eddies ; one , given a second 's firm footing , jumped for dear life and saved himself ; the bodies of the others were found , many days afterwards , jammed against stakes placed in the stream a mile lower down to prevent fish poachers from netting an open reach .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 14]: This deluge , if indeed aught else were needed , wrecked the Feast .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 11]: Every booth was dismantled , each wagon and caravan packed .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 42]: The van dwellers only ceased their labors when all was in readiness for a move to the next fair ground ; the Elmsdale week , usually a bright spot in their migratory calendar , was marked this year with absolute loss .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 17]: At the best , and in few instances , it yielded a bare payment of expenses .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 14]: Farmers , of course , toiled early and late to avert further disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 41]: Stock were driven from pastures where danger threatened ; cut corn was rescued in the hope that the next day 's sun might dry it ; choked ditches were raked with long hoes to permit the water to flow off .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 36]: At last , when night fell , and the rain diminished to a thin drizzle , though the barometer gave no promise of improvement , men gathered in the village street and began comparing notes .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 29]: Everyone had suffered in some degree ; even the shopkeepers and private residents complained of ruined goods , gardens rooted up , houses invaded by the all-pervading floods .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 8]: But the farmers endured the greatest damage .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 17]: Some had lost their half-year 's rent , many would be faced with privation and bankruptcy .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 35]: Thrice fortunate now were the men with capital -- those who could look forward with equanimity to another season when the wanton havoc inflicted by this wild raging of the waters should be recouped .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 23]: John Bolland , protected by an oilskin coat , crossed the road between the stockyard and the White House about eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 24]: `` Eh , Mr. Bollan ' , but this is a sad day 's wark , '' said a friend who encountered him .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 35]: `` Ah , it 's bad , very bad , an ' likely te be worse , '' replied John , lifting his bent head and casting a weather-wise glance over the northerly moor .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 24]: `` I 've lost t ' best part o ' six acres o ' wuts , '' -LRB- oats -RRB- growled his neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 22]: `` It 's hard to know what spite there was in t ' clouds te burst i ' that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 19]: `` Times an ' seasons are n't i ' man 's hands , '' was the quiet answer .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 22]: `` There 'd be ill deed if sunshine an ' storm were settled by voates , like a county-council election . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 14]: `` Mebbe , and mebbe nut , '' cried the other testily . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 17]: 'T is easy to leave ivvrything te Providence when yer money 's mostly i ' stock .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: Mine happens te be i ' crops . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 25]: `` An ' if mine were i ' crops , Mr. Pattison , I sud still thry te desarve well o ' Providence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 15]: This shrewd thrust evoked no wrath from Pattison , who was not a chapel-goer .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 4]: `` Gosh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 9]: he laughed , `` some folks are lucky .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 17]: They pile up riches both i ' this wulld an ' t ' wulld te come .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 7]: Hooivver , we wo n't argy .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 17]: Hev ye heerd t ' news fra ' te t ' ` Black Lion ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 7]: `` Aboot poor George Pickerin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 2]: Noa .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 12]: I 've bin ower thrang i ' t ' cow-byre . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 11]: `` He 's married , an ' med his will .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 7]: Betsy is Mrs. Pickerin ' noo .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 13]: But she 'll be a widdy afore t ' mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 10]: `` Is he as bad as all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 9]: `` Sinkin ' fast , they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 25]: He kep ' up , like the game ` un he allus was , until Mr. Croft left him alone wi ' his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 7]: Then he fell away te nowt .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 9]: He 's ravin ' , I hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 3]: `` Croft !
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 9]: I thowt Stockwell looked efther his affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 4]: `` Right enough !
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 16]: But Stockwell 's ya -LRB- one -RRB- trustee , Mr. Herbert 's t ' other .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 7]: So Croft had te act . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 13]: `` Well , I 'm rale sorry for t ' poor chap .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 9]: He 's coom tiv a bad end . ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 17]: `` Ye 'll be t ' foreman o ' t ' jury , most like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 3]: `` Noa .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 7]: I 'll be spared that job .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 11]: Martin is a witness , more 's t ' pity .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 5]: Good-night , Mr. Pattison .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 21]: It 'll hu ' t none if y ' are minded te offer up a prayer for betther weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 16]: But the prayers of many just men did not avail to save Elmsdale that night .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 14]: After a brief respite , the storm came on again with gusty malevolence .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 28]: Black despair sat by many a fireside , and in no place was its grim visage seen more plainly than in the bedroom where George Pickering died .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 43]: Dr. MacGregor watched the fitful flickering of the strong man 's life , until , at last , he led the afflicted wife from the room and consigned her to the care of her weeping sister and the hardly less sorrowful landlady .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 20]: At the foot of the stairs were waiting P. C. Benson and the reporter of the _ Messenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 11]: `` It is all over , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 10]: `` He died at a quarter past ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 15]: `` The same hour that he was -- wounded , '' commented the reporter .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 10]: `` What was the precise cause of death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 8]: `` Failure of the heart 's action .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 6]: It was a merciful release .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 13]: Otherwise , he might have survived for days and suffered greatly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 10]: The policeman adjusted his cape and lowered his chin-strap .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 11]: `` I mun start for Nottonby , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 18]: `` T ' inquest 'll likely be oppenned o ' Satherday at two o'clock , doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 23]: By the way , Benson , you can tell Mr. Jonas that the county analyst and I are ready with our evidence .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 15]: There is no need for an adjournment , unless the police require it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 14]: The constable saluted and set off on a lonely tramp through the rain .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 18]: He crossed the footbridge over the beck -- the water was nearly level with the stout planks .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 17]: `` I have n't seen a wilder night for monny a year , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 17]: `` There 'll be a nice how-d'ye-do if t ' brig is gone afore daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 8]: He trudged the four miles to Nottonby .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 26]: Nearing the outskirts of the small market town , he was startled by finding the body of a man lying face down in the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 8]: The pelting gale had extinguished his lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 14]: He managed to turn the prostrate form and raise the man 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 16]: Then , after several failures , he induced a match to flare for a second .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 4]: One glance sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 5]: `` Rabbit Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 7]: `` And blind as a bat !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: Get up , ye drunken swine .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 28]: ` Twould be sarvin ' ye right te lave ye i ' the road until ye were runned over or caught yer death o ' cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 23]: From the manner of P. C. Benson 's language it may be inferred that his actions were not characterized by extreme gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 9]: He managed to shake the poacher into semi-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 13]: Rabbit Jack , wobbling on his feet , lurched against the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 18]: `` Hello , ole fell ' , coom along wi ' me , '' he mumbled amiably .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 7]: `` Nivver mind t ' brass .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 5]: I 've got plenty .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: Good soart , George Pickerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 11]: Gim me me a sov ' , ' e did .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 17]: Fo-or , ` e 's a jolly good feller -- '' A further shaking was disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 4]: He collapsed again .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 11]: The perplexed policeman noted a haymew behind a neighboring gate .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 22]: He dragged the nondescript thither by the scruff of his neck and threw him on the lee side of the shelter .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 13]: `` He 'll be sober by mornin ' , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 15]: `` I hev overmuch thrubble aboot te tew mysen wi ' this varmint . ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: And so ended the first of the dead man 's bequests .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 26]: The gathering of a jury in a country village for an important inquest like that occasioned by George Pickering 's death is a solemn function .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 32]: Care is exercised in empaneling men of repute , and , in the present instance , several prominent farmers were debarred from service because their children would be called as witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 13]: The inquest was held , by permission , in the National schoolhouse .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 17]: No room in the inn would accommodate a tithe of the people who wished to attend .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 19]: Many journalists put in an appearance , the _ Messenger _ reporter 's paragraphs having attracted widespread attention .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 18]: It was noteworthy , too , that Superintendent Jonas did not conduct the case for the police .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 47]: He obtained the aid of a solicitor , Mr. Dane , with whom the coroner , Dr. Magnus , drove from Nottonby in a closed carriage , for the rain had not ceased , save during very brief intervals , since the outbreak on Thursday morning .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 24]: The jury , having been sworn , elected Mr. Webster , grocer , as their foreman , and proceeded to view the body .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 22]: When they reassembled in the schoolroom it was seen that Betsy , now Mrs. Pickering , was seated next her sister .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 27]: With them were two old people whom a few persons present recognized as the girls ' parents , and by Betsy 's side was Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 16]: Among the crowd of witnesses were Martin , Frank and Ernest Beckett-Smythe , and Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 23]: The mortification , the angry dismay of Mrs. Saumarez when her daughter was warned to attend the inquest may well be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 35]: The police are no respecters of persons , and P. C. Benson , of course , ascertained easily the name of the girl concerning whom Martin and young Beckett-Smythe fought on the eventful night .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 19]: She might be an important witness , so her mother was told to send her to the court .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 19]: Mrs. Saumarez disdained to accompany the girl in person , and Fran√ßoise was deputed to act as convoy .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 34]: The Normandy nurse 's white linen bands offered a quaint contrast to the black robes worn by the other women and gave material for a descriptive sentence to every journalist in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 19]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe , the vicar , Dr. MacGregor , and the county analyst occupied chairs beside the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 24]: The latter gentleman described the nature of the inquiry with businesslike brevity , committing himself to no statements save those that were obvious .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 8]: When he concluded , Mr. Dane rose .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 11]: `` I appear for the police , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 32]: `` And I , '' said Mr. Stockwell , `` am here to watch the interests of Mrs. Pickering , having received her husband 's written instructions to that effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 9]: A deep hush fell on the packed assembly .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 12]: The curious nature of the announcement was a surprise in itself .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 14]: The reporters ' pencils were busy , and the Coroner adjusted his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: `` The written instructions of the dead man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 23]: My friend , my lifelong friend , Mr. George Pickering , was but too well aware of the fate that threatened him .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 15]: I have here a letter , written and signed by him on Thursday morning .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 10]: With your permission , I will read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 9]: `` I object , '' cried Mr. Dane .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 6]: `` On what grounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 4]: asked the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 16]: `` Such a letter may have a prejudicial effect on the minds of the jury .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 20]: They are here to determine , with your direction , a verdict to be arrived at on certain evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 10]: This letter can not be regarded as evidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 6]: Mr. Stockwell shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 12]: `` I do not press the point , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 24]: `` I fail to see any harm in showing a husband 's anxiety that his wife should be cleared of absurd imputations . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 4]: Mr. Dane reddened .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 13]: `` I consider that a highly improper remark , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 5]: The other only smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 7]: He had won the first round .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 22]: The jury knew what the letter contained , and he had placed the case for the police in an unfavorable light .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 15]: The first witness , Pickering 's farm bailiff , gave formal evidence of identity .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 21]: Then the Coroner read the dead man 's deposition , which was attested by the local justice of the peace .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 7]: Dr. Magnus rendered the document impressively .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 12]: Its concluding appeal to the Deity turned all eyes on Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 7]: She was pale , but composed .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 11]: Since her husband 's death she had cried but little .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 7]: Her mute grief rendered her beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: Sorrow had given dignity to a pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 16]: She was so white , so unmoved outwardly , that she resembled a clothed statue .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 16]: Kitty wept quietly all the time , but Betsy sat like one in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 23]: `` Catherine Thwaites , '' said the Coroner 's officer , and Kitty was led by Mr. Jones to the witness stand .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 19]: The girl 's evidence , punctuated by sobs , was practically a r√©sum√© of Pickering 's sworn statement .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 16]: From Mr. Dane 's attitude it was apparent that he regarded this witness as untruthful .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 40]: `` Of course , '' he said , with quiet satire in word and look , `` as Mr. Pickering impaled himself on a fork , you did not see your sister plunge a knife into his breast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 23]: `` Nor did you run down the garden shrieking : ` Oh , Betsy , Betsy , you 've killed him . '
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 9]: You did not cry ` Murder , murder !
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 11]: Come , someone , for God 's sake ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir ; I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 7]: This unexpected admission puzzled the solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 17]: He darted a sharp side glance at Stockwell , but the latter was busy scribbling notes .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 6]: Every pulse in court quickened .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 8]: `` Oh , you did , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 16]: But why charge your sister with a crime you did not see her commit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 23]: `` Because she had a knife in her hand , and I saw Mr. Pickering stagger across the garden and fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 9]: `` In what direction did he stagger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 8]: `` Away from the stackyard hedge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 7]: `` This is a serious matter .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 23]: You are on your oath , and there is such a thing as being an accessory after -- '' Up sprang Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 15]: `` I protest most strongly against this witness being threatened , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 20]: `` I think Mr. Dane is entitled to warn the witness against false testimony , '' said the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 15]: `` Of course , he knows the grave responsibility attached to such insinuations . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 7]: Mr. Dane waved an emphatic hand .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 10]: `` I require no threats , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 7]: `` I have evidence in plenty .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 41]: Do you swear that Mr. Pickering did not lurch forward from beneath the pear tree at the foot of the garden after being stabbed by your sister , who surprised him in your arms , or you in his arms ?
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 7]: It is the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 10]: `` I do , '' was the prompt answer .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 9]: The lawyer sat down , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 13]: `` Any questions to put to the witness , Mr. Stockwell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 4]: said the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: I regard her evidence as quite clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 17]: `` Will you -- er -- does your client Mrs. Pickering wish to give evidence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 29]: `` My client -- she is not my client of her own volition , but by the definite instructions of her dead husband -- will certainly give evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 17]: May I express the hope that my learned friend will not deal with her too harshly ?
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 13]: She is hardly in a fit state to appear here to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 10]: Mr. Dane smiled cynically , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 25]: He declined to help his adversary 's adroit maneuvers by fiery opposition , though again had Mr. Stockwell succeeded in playing a trump card .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 28]: Betsy was duly warned by the Coroner that she might be charged with the wilful murder of George Pickering , notwithstanding the sworn deposition read in court .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 36]: She could exercise her own judgment as to whether or not she would offer testimony , but anything she said would be taken down in writing , and might be used as evidence against her .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 6]: She never raised her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 17]: Not even those terrible words , `` wilful murder , '' had power to move her .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 14]: She stood like an automaton , and seemed to await permission to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 24]: `` Now , Mrs. Pickering , '' said Dr. Magnus , `` tell us , in your own words , what happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 5]: She began her story .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 16]: No one could fail to perceive that she was reciting a narrative learnt by heart .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 8]: She used no words in the vernacular .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 11]: All was good English , coherent , simple , straightforward .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 27]: On the Monday morning , she said , she received a letter at Hereford from Fred Marshall , ostler at the `` Black Lion Hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 7]: `` Have you that letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 4]: asked the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' interposed Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 6]: `` Here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 6]: He handed forward a document .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 7]: A buzz of whispered comment arose .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 13]: In compliance with Dr. Magnus 's request , Betsy identified it listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 6]: Then it was read aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 16]: Apart from mistakes in spelling , it ran as follows : `` Dear Miss Thwaites .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 18]: -- This is to let you know that George Pickering is carrying on with your sister Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 10]: He has promised to meet her here on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 7]: He has engaged a bedroom here .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 8]: You ought to come and stop it .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 10]: I inclose P.O. for one pound toward your fare .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 17]: -- Yours truly , Fred Marshall , groom , ` Black Lion , ' Elmsdale . ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 20]: The fact that this meddlesome personage had sent Betsy her railway fare became known now for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 7]: A hiss writhed through the court .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 4]: `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 11]: yelled a police sergeant , glaring around with steely eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 17]: `` There must be no demonstrations of any sort here , '' said the Coroner sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 12]: `` Well , Mrs. Pickering , you traveled to Elmsdale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 8]: `` With what purpose in view ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 8]: `` George had promised to marry me .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 6]: Kitty knew this quite well .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 17]: I thought that my presence would put an end to any courtship that was going on .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 6]: It was very wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 6]: `` None will dispute that .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 8]: But I prefer not to question you .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 7]: Tell us your own story . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 20]: `` I traveled all day , '' she recommenced , `` and reached Elmsdale station by the last train .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 5]: I was very tired .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 11]: At the door of the inn I met Fred Marshall .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 7]: He was waiting , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 15]: He told me George and Kitty were at the bottom of the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 19]: A quiver ran through the audience , but the police sergeant was watching , and they feared expulsion .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 10]: `` He said they had been there ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 7]: I ran through the hotel kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 14]: On a table was lying a long knife near a dish of grouse .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 18]: I picked it up , hardly knowing what I was doing , and went into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 11]: When I was halfway down Kitty saw me and screamed .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 11]: George turned round and backed away toward the middle hedge .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 21]: I remember crying out -- some -- things -- but I do not -- know -- what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 13]: She swayed slightly , and everyone thought she was about to faint .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 12]: But she clutched the back of a chair and steadied herself .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 14]: Mr. Jones offered her a glass of water , but she refused it .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 11]: `` I can go on , '' she said bravely .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 14]: And she persevered to the end , substantially repeating her sister 's evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 14]: When Mr. Dane rose to cross-examine , the silence in court was appalling .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 9]: The girl 's parents were pallid with fear .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 4]: Kitty sat spellbound .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 13]: Mr. Stockwell pushed his papers away and gazed fixedly at his client .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 13]: `` Why did you pick up the knife , Mrs. Pickering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 5]: was the first question .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 19]: `` I think -- I am almost sure -- I intended to strike my sister with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 5]: This was another bombshell .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 8]: Mr. Dane moved uneasily on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 5]: `` Your sister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 5]: he repeated in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 7]: She was aware of my circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 13]: What right had she to be flirting with my promised husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 3]: `` Hum !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: You have forgiven her since , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 12]: `` I forgave her then , when I regained my senses .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 5]: She was acting thoughtlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 17]: I believe that George and she went into the garden only to spite Fred Marshall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 6]: Mr. Dane shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 23]: `` So , if we accept your statement , Mrs. Pickering , you harmed no one with the knife except yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 6]: `` That is so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 21]: He seemed to hesitate a moment , but seemingly made up his mind to leave the evidence where it stood .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 21]: `` I shall not detain you long , '' said Mr. Stockwell when his legal opponent desisted from further cross-examination .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 15]: `` You were married to Mr. Pickering on Thursday morning by special license ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 17]: `` He had executed a marriage settlement securing you # 400 a year for life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 16]: `` And , after the accident , you remained with him until he died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 8]: `` Yes -- God help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 10]: `` Just one moment , '' interposed the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 15]: `` Were you previously acquainted with this man , Marshall , the groom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 28]: I saw him for the first time in my life when he met me at the hotel door and asked me if I was Miss Thwaites . ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 9]: `` How did he obtain your Hereford address ?
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 12]: It appears to be given in full on the envelope . ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 9]: `` I do n't know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 7]: Fred Marshall was the next witness .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 7]: He was sober and exceedingly nervous .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 16]: He had been made aware during the past week that public opinion condemned him utterly .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 9]: His old cronies refused to drink with him .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 18]: Mrs. Atkinson had dismissed him ; he was a pariah , an outcast , in the village .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 23]: His evidence consisted of a disconnected series of insinuations against Kitty 's character , interlarded with protests that he meant no harm .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: Mr. Stockwell showed him scant mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 27]: `` You say you saw Mrs. Pickering , or Betsy Thwaites , as she was at that time , seize a knife from the table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 5]: `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 13]: `` What did you think she meant to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 11]: `` What she did do -- stick George Pickerin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 14]: I heerd her bawlin ' that oot both afore an ' efther . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 5]: The man was desperate .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 25]: In his own parlance , he might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb , and he would spare no one .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 5]: `` Oh , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 9]: You knew she intended to commit murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 6]: `` I thowt so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 10]: `` Then why did you not follow her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 6]: `` I was skeered . ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 7]: Afraid of a weak woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 15]: `` Well , I did n't give a damn if she did stab him !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 8]: There , ye hev it straight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 7]: Mr. Stockwell turned to Mr. Dane .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 23]: `` If you are looking for accessories in this trumped-up case , you have one ready to hand , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 18]: `` You must be careful what you are saying , Marshall , '' observed the Coroner severely .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 8]: `` And moderate your language , too .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 8]: This court is not a stable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 15]: `` He should n't badger me , '' cried the witness in sullen anger .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 23]: `` I 'll treat you with great tenderness , '' said Mr. Stockwell suavely , and a general smile relieved the tension .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 13]: `` How did you obtain Miss Thwaites 's address at Hereford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 5]: `` Come , now .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 5]: Where are your wits ?
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 23]: Will you accuse me of badgering you , if I suggest that you stole a letter from Kitty Thwaites 's pocket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 7]: `` I did n't steal it .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 15]: It was in a frock of hers , hangin ' in her bedroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 6]: `` You are most obliging .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 7]: And the sovereign you sent her ?
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 14]: Did you , by any chance , borrow it from Mrs. Atkinson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 5]: `` Frae Mrs. Atkinson ?
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 5]: Whe√§ said that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 12]: `` Oh , I mean without her knowledge , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 12]: From Mrs. Atkinson 's till , I should have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 6]: The chance shot went home .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 13]: The miserable groom growled a denial , but no one believed him .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 16]: Quite satisfied that he had destroyed the man 's credibility , Mr. Stockwell sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 6]: `` Martin Court Bolland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 16]: said the Coroner 's officer , and a wave of renewed interest galvanized the court .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 28]: Mr. Dane arranged his papers and looked around with the air of one who says : `` Now we shall hear the truth of this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 4]: Martin came forward .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 14]: It chanced that the first pair of eyes he encountered were Ang√®le 's .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 15]: The girl was gazing at him with a spiteful intensity he could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 47]: He did not know then of the painful expos√© which took place at The Elms when Mrs. Saumarez learnt on the preceding day that her daughter was a leading figure among the children in the `` Black Lion '' yard on the night of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 11]: Ang√®le blamed Martin for having betrayed her to the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 28]: She did not know how resolutely he had declined to mention her name ; he loomed large in her mind , to the exclusion of the others .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 23]: She regarded him now with a venomous malice all the more bitter because of the ultra-friendly relations she had forced on him .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 8]: He looked at her with genuine astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 14]: She reminded him of the wildcat he choked to death in Thor ghyll .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 15]: But he had to collect his wandering faculties , for the Coroner was speaking .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 11]: CHAPTER XV THE UNWRITTEN LAW Martin 's evidence was concise .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 23]: He happened to be in the `` Black Lion '' yard with other children at a quarter past ten on Monday night .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 31]: He heard a woman 's scream , followed by a man 's loud cry of pain , and both sounds seemed to come from the extreme end of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 21]: Kitty Thwaites ran toward the hotel shrieking , `` Oh , Betsy , Betsy , you 've killed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 19]: She screamed `` Murder '' and called for someone to come , `` for God 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 11]: She fell exactly opposite the place where he was standing .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 23]: Then he saw Betsy Thwaites -- he identified her now as Mrs. Pickering -- running after her sister and brandishing a knife .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 18]: She appeared to be very excited , and cried out , `` I 'll swing for him .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 15]: May the Lord deal wi ' him as he dealt wi ' me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 26]: She called her sister a `` strumpet , '' and said it would `` serve her right to stick her with the same knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 10]: He was quite sure those were the exact words .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 33]: He was not alarmed in any way , only surprised by the sudden uproar , and he saw the two women and the knife as plainly as if it were broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 30]: Mr. Dane concluded the examination-in-chief , which he punctuated with expressive glances at the jury , by touching on a point which he expected his acute rival to raise .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 19]: `` What were you doing in the ` Black Lion ' yard at that hour , Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 12]: `` I was having a dispute with Master Frank Beckett-Smythe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 8]: `` What sort of a dispute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: `` Well , we were fighting . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 7]: A grin ran through the court .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 11]: `` He is an intelligent boy and older than you .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 22]: Can you suggest any reason why he should have failed to see and hear all that you saw and heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 3]: Martin paused .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 17]: He disliked to pose as a vainglorious pugilist , but there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 13]: `` I got the better of him , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 25]: `` One , at least , of his eyes were closed , and I had just given him an uppercut on the nose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 10]: `` But his brother was there , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 9]: `` Master Ernest was looking after him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 8]: `` How about the other children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 6]: `` They ran away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 6]: `` All of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 6]: `` Well , nearly all .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 9]: I can only speak for myself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 12]: No doubt the others will tell you what they saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 17]: Obviously , Mr. Dane was unprepared for the cool self-possession displayed by this farmer 's son .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 11]: He nodded acquiescence with Martin 's views and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 40]: Mr. Stockwell , watching the boy narrowly , had caught the momentary gleam of surprise when his look encountered that of the pretty dark-eyed child whose fashionable attire distinguished her from the village urchins among whom she was sitting .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 18]: `` By the way , '' he began , `` why do you call yourself Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 9]: `` That is my name , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 9]: `` Are you John Bolland 's son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: `` Then whose son are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: `` I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 11]: My father and mother adopted me thirteen years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 22]: The lawyer gathered by the expression on the stolid faces of the jury that this line of inquiry would be fruitless .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 15]: `` What was the cause of the fight between you and young Beckett-Smythe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 11]: This was the signal for an interruption from the jury .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 18]: Mr. Webster , the foreman , did not wish any slight to be placed on Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 12]: The upshot might be that he would lose a good customer .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 7]: The Squire dealt at the Stores .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 7]: Let him protect his own children .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 7]: But Mrs. Saumarez needed a champion .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 33]: `` May I ask , sir , '' he said to the Coroner , `` what a bit of a row atween youngsters hez te do wi ' t ' case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 12]: `` Nothing that I can see , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 14]: `` It has a highly important bearing , '' put in Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 28]: `` If my information is correct , this witness is the only one whose evidence connects Mrs. Pickering even remotely with the injuries received by her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 16]: I assume , of course , that Marshall 's testimony is not worth a straw .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 18]: I shall endeavor to elicit facts that may tend to prove the boy 's statements unreliable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 17]: `` I can not interfere with your discretion , Mr. Stockwell , '' was the ruling .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 12]: `` Now , answer my question , '' cried the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 8]: Martin 's brown eyes flashed back indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 21]: `` We fought because I wished to take a young lady home , and he tried to prevent me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 5]: `` A young lady !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: What young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 8]: `` I refuse to mention her name .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 13]: You asked why we fought , and I 've told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 11]: `` Why this squeamishness , my young squire of dames ?
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 7]: Was it not Ang√®le Saumarez ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 6]: Martin turned to the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 8]: `` Must I reply , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 18]: `` Yes ... I fail still to see the drift of the cross-examination , Mr. Stockwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 7]: `` It will become apparent quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 8]: Yes , or no , Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 7]: `` Yes ; it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 12]: `` Was she committed to your care by her mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: She came out to see the fair .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 8]: I promised to look after her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 18]: `` Were you better fitted to protect this child than the two sons of Mr. Beckett-Smythe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 6]: `` I thought so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 16]: `` From what evil influences , then , was it necessary to rescue her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 11]: `` That 's not a fair way to put it .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 11]: It was too late for her to be out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 10]: `` When did you discover this undeniable fact ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 5]: `` Just then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 15]: `` Not when you were taking her through the fair in lordly style ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 21]: There was no harm in the shows , and I realized the time only when the clock struck ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 6]: Every adult listener nodded approval .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 18]: The adroit lawyer saw that he was merely strengthening the jury 's good opinion of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 18]: He must strike hard and unmercifully if he would shake their belief in Martin 's good faith .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 27]: `` There were several other children there -- a boy named Bates , another named Beadlam , Mrs. Atkinson 's three girls , and others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 6]: `` Bates was with me .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 8]: The others were in the yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 14]: `` Ah , yes ; they had left you a few minutes earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 30]: Now , is it not a fact that these children , and you with them , had gone to this hiding-place to escape being caught by your seniors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 9]: `` No ; it is a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 7]: `` Is that your honest belief ?
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 6]: Do you swear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 5]: `` I shirked nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 5]: Neither did the others .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 6]: Hundreds of people saw us .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 19]: As for Miss Saumarez , I think she went there for a lark more than anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 7]: `` A questionable sort of lark .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 15]: It is amazing to hear of respectable children being out at such an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 19]: Did your parents -- did the parents of any of the others realize what was going on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 8]: The whole thing was an accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 19]: `` But , surely , there must be some adequate explanation of this fight between you and Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 11]: It was no mere scuffle , but a severe set-to .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 11]: He bears even yet the marks of the encounter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 18]: Master Frank was supremely uncomfortable when the united gaze of the court was thus directed to him .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 17]: His right eye was discolored , as all might see , but his nose was normal .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 9]: `` I have told you the exact truth .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 15]: I wished her to go home -- '' `` Did she wish it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 13]: `` She meant to tease me , and said she would remain .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 18]: Frank Beckett-Smythe and I agreed to fight , and settle whether she should go or stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 60]: `` So you ask us to believe that not only did you engage in a bout of fisticuffs in order to convoy to her home a girl already hours too late abroad , but that you alone , of all these children , can give us a correct version of occurrences on the other side of the hedge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 21]: `` I do n't remember asking you that , sir , '' said Martin seriously , and the court laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 7]: Mr. Stockwell betrayed a little heat .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 12]: `` You know well what I mean , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 7]: `` You are a clever boy .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 14]: Are you not depending on your imagination for some of your facts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 14]: `` I wish I were , sir , '' was the sorrowful answer .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 8]: Quite unconsciously , Martin looked at Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 24]: Some magnetic influence caused her to raise her eyes for the first time , and each gazed into the soul of the other .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 11]: Mr. Stockwell covered his retreat by an assumption of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 29]: `` Fortunately , there is a host of witnesses to be heard in regard to these particular events , '' he exclaimed , and Martin 's inquisition ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: The superintendent whispered something to Mr. Dane , who rose .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 23]: `` A great deal has been made out of this quarrel about a little girl , '' he said to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 22]: `` Is it not the fact that you have endeavored consistently to keep her name out of the affair altogether ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 21]: `` Because Mrs. Saumarez is only a visitor here , and her daughter could not know anything of village ways .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 25]: I was mostly to blame for allowing her to be there at all , so I tried to take it onto my shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 11]: It was interesting to note how Ang√®le received this statement .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 6]: Her black eyes became tearful .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 5]: Her hero was rehabilitated .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 6]: She worshiped him again passionately .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 5]: Someone else had peached .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 17]: She brushed away the tears and darted a quick look at the Squire 's eldest son .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 6]: He was the next witness .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 21]: He saw George Pickering and Kitty go down the garden , the man 's arm being around Kitty 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: Then he fought with Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 21]: Afterwards he heard some screaming , but could not tell a word that was said -- he was too dazed .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 21]: `` Is it not possible the hubbub was too confused that you should gain any intelligible idea of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 4]: asked Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 9]: `` Yes , that might be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 10]: `` You are a bigger boy than young Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 12]: Surely he could not pummel the wits out of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 10]: `` I do n't think he will next time .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 9]: He caught me a stinger by chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 12]: A roar of laughter greeted this candid confession of future intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 9]: Even Mr. Beckett-Smythe and the vicar joined in .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 19]: `` Why did you wish to keep this girl , Ang√®le Saumarez , away from her residence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 26]: `` She 's a jolly sort of girl , and I think we were all a bit off our heads , '' said Frank ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 10]: `` But you had some motive , some design .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 9]: Remember , you fought to retain her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 17]: `` I wish I had n't , '' said the boy , glancing at his father .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 15]: His most active memory was of a certain painful interview on Wednesday night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 20]: _ You _ were not groggy on your legs , '' was Mr. Stockwell 's first remark to Ernest .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 13]: `` What did you hear or see beyond the garden hedge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 16]: `` There was a lot of yelling , and two women ran toward the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 21]: The woman with a knife was threatening to stick it into somebody , but I could n't tell who . ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 8]: She was running after the other woman .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 13]: Do n't you think she might have been threatening her only ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 8]: `` It certainly looked like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 12]: `` Ca n't you help us by being more definite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 7]: Frank was asking for a pump .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 16]: I was thinking of that more than of the beastly row in the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 4]: He was dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 5]: `` Ang√®le Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 10]: The strangers present surveyed the girl with expectant interest .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 7]: She looked a delightfully innocent child .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 14]: She was attired in the dark dress she wore on the Monday evening .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 12]: Her hat , gloves , and shoes were in perfect taste .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 22]: No personality could be more oddly at variance with a village brawl than this delicate , gossamer , fairy-like little mortal .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 9]: She gave her evidence without constraint or shyness .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 11]: Her pretty continental accent enhanced the charm of her manners .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 29]: In no sense forward , she won instant approbation , and the general view was that she had drifted into an unpleasant predicament by sheer force of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 32]: The mere love of fun brought her out to see the fair , and her presence in the stackyard was accounted for by a girlish delight in setting boys at loggerheads .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 22]: But she helped the police contention by declaring that she heard Betsy say : `` I 'll swing for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 15]: `` I remember , '' she said sweetly , `` wondering what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 5]: To swing for anybody !
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 5]: That is odd . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 18]: `` Might it not have been ` for her ' and not ` for him ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 4]: suggested Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , '' agreed Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 9]: `` I would n't be sure about that .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 7]: They talk queerly , these people .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 10]: I am certain about the ` swing ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 11]: Really , there never was a more simple little maid .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 19]: `` You must never again go out at night to such places , '' remarked the Coroner paternally .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 6]: She cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 10]: `` Mamma was very angry , '' she simpered .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 17]: `` I have been kept at home for days and days on account of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 5]: She glanced at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 7]: That explanation was intended for him .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 26]: As a matter of fact , Mr. Beckett-Smythe called at The Elms on Thursday morning and told Mrs. Saumarez that her child needed more control .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 21]: He had thrashed Frank soundly the previous evening for riding off to a rendezvous fixed with Ang√®le for nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 16]: He whispered this information to Mr. Herbert , and the vicar 's eyes opened wide .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 16]: The other non-professional witnesses , children and adults , did not advance the inquiry materially .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 23]: Many heard Kitty shrieking that her sister had murdered George Pickering , but Kitty herself had admitted saying so under a misapprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 8]: P. C. Benson raised an important point .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 29]: The pitchfork was first mentioned about eleven o'clock , when Mr. Pickering was able to talk coherently , after being laid on a bed and drinking some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 10]: Neither of the two women had spoken of it .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 19]: And there were footprints that did not bear out the movements described in the dead man 's deposition .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 14]: `` But Mr. Pickering 's first lucid thought referred to this implement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 4]: said Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 10]: `` Ne√§body was holdin ' him , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 11]: The policeman imagined the lawyer had said `` loosened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 29]: `` I mean that the first account he ever gave of this accident referred to the pitchfork , and his subsequent statements were to the same effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 5]: `` Oah , yes .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 8]: There 's no denyin ' that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 15]: `` And you found the fork lying exactly where he described its position ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 28]: `` Why , yes ; but he was a desp ` rate lang time i ' studdyin ' t ' matter oot afore he 's speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 15]: `` Do you suggest that someone placed the fork there by his instructions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 5]: `` Noa , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 10]: Most like he 'd seen it there hissen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 17]: `` Then why do you refuse to accept his statement that an accident took place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 26]: `` Because I f ` und his footprints where he ran across t ' garden te t ' spot where he was picked up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 3]: `` Footprints !
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 8]: After a month of fine weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 16]: `` It was soft mold , sir , an ' they were plain enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 17]: `` Were not a dozen men running about this garden at twenty minutes past ten ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 7]: `` Ay -- quite that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 16]: `` And you tell us coolly that you could distinguish those of one man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 18]: `` There was on ' y one man 's track i ' that ple√§ce , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 7]: Benson was not to be flurried .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 10]: Mr. Jonas and a police sergeant corroborated his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 4]: Dr. MacGregor followed .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 18]: He described Pickering 's wound , the nature of his illness , and the cause of death .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 10]: The stab itself was not of a fatal character .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 11]: Had it diverged slightly it must have reached the lung .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 16]: As it was , the poison , not the knife , had done the mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 7]: The county analyst was scientifically dogmatic .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 10]: His analyses had been conducted with the utmost care .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 11]: The knife was contaminated , the pitchfork was only rusty .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 21]: The latter was a dangerous implement , but in no way responsible for the state of Pickering 's blood corpuscles .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 36]: Mr. Dane , of course , made the most of these witnesses , but Mr. Stockwell wisely forbore from pressing them , and thus hammering the main items again into the heads of the jury .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 7]: The Coroner glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 5]: It was six o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 23]: Neither of the solicitors was permitted to address the court , and he made up his mind to conclude the inquiry forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 15]: `` There is one matter which might be cleared up , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 9]: `` Where is Marshall , the groom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 15]: It was discovered that the man had left the court half an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 5]: He had not returned .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 8]: P.C. Benson was sent to find him .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 8]: The two came back in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 11]: Their arrival was heralded by loud shouts and laughter outside .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 11]: When they entered the schoolroom Marshall presented a ludicrous spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 20]: He was dripping wet , and not from rain , for his clothes were covered with slime and mud .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 16]: It transpired that he had gone to a public house for a pint of beer .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 32]: Several men and youths who could not gain admittance to the court took advantage of the absence of the police and amused themselves by ducking him in a convenient horse pond .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 24]: The Coroner , having expressed his official annoyance at the incident , asked the shivering man if he followed Betsy into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: No ; he saw her go out through the back door .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 23]: `` Then the threats you heard were uttered while she was in the passage of the hotel or in the kitchen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 6]: Yes ; that was so .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 25]: `` It is noteworthy , '' said the Coroner , `` that none of the children heard this young woman going toward the couple .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 29]: She must have run swiftly and silently down the path , and the witnesses were so absorbed in the fight that she passed them unheard and unseen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 4]: Mr. Stockwell frowned .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 19]: If this gave any indication of the Coroner 's summing-up , it was not favorable to his client .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 22]: Dr. Magnus showed at once that he meant to cast aside all sentimental considerations and adhere solely to the judicial elements .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 33]: He treated George Pickering 's deposition with all respect , but pointed out that the dying man might be actuated by the desire to make atonement to the woman he had wronged .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 9]: The human mind was capable of strange vagaries .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 47]: A man who would slight , or , at any rate , be indifferent , to one of the opposite sex , when far removed from personal contact , was often swayed by latent ties of affection when brought face to face with the woman herself .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 20]: In a word , the Coroner threw all his weight on the side of the police and against Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 24]: He regarded Fred Marshall and young Bolland as truthful witnesses , though inspired by different motives , and deemed the medical evidence conclusive .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 7]: Betsy sat sphinx-like through this ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 30]: Her unhappy parents , and even more unhappy sister , were profoundly distressed , and Stockwell watched the jury keenly as each damning point against his client was emphasized .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 18]: `` The law is quite clear in affairs of this kind , '' concluded Dr. Magnus gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 26]: `` Either this unfortunate man was murdered , in which event your verdict can only take one form , or he met with an accident .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 24]: Most fortunately , the last word does not rest with this court , or it would be impossible to close the inquiry to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 20]: The deceased himself raised a pertinent question : Why did his wife escape blood-poisoning , although he became infected ?
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 31]: But the solicitors present apparently concur with me that this is a matter which must be determined elsewhere -- '' `` No , no , '' broke in Mr. Stockwell .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 9]: `` I admit nothing of the sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 4]: The Coroner bowed .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 18]: `` You have the benefit of my opinion , gentlemen , '' he said to the jury .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 11]: `` You must retire now and consider your verdict . ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 22]: The jury filed out into a classroom , an unusual proceeding , but highly expedient in an inquiry of such importance .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 20]: Tongues were loosened instantly , and a hum of talk arose , while the witnesses signed their recorded statements .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 28]: Kitty endeavored to arouse her sister from the condition of stupor in which she remained , and the girl 's mother placed an arm around her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 6]: But Betsy paid little heed .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 24]: Her mind dwelt on one object only -- a sheet-covered form , lying cold and inanimate in a room of the neighboring hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 11]: Ang√®le sidled toward Martin when a movement in court permitted .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 24]: Fran√ßoise would have restrained her , but the child slid along a bench so quickly that the nurse 's protest came too late .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 12]: `` Martin , '' she whispered , `` you behaved beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 9]: I was so angry with you at first .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 6]: But it was not you .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 4]: I know now .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 5]: Evelyn Atkinson told . ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 14]: `` I wish it had never happened , '' said the boy bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 19]: He hated the notion that his evidence was the strongest link in the chain encircling the hapless Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't find it bad , this court .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 9]: One is all pins and needles at first .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 7]: But the men are nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 12]: `` I am not thinking of ourselves , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 3]: `` Tiens !
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 6]: Of whom , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 8]: `` Ang√®le , you 're awfully selfish .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 13]: What have we to endure , compared with poor Mrs. Pickering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 5]: `` Oh , pouf !
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 5]: That is her affair .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 6]: Mamma beat me on Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 6]: Beat me , look you !
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 11]: But I made her stop , oh , so quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 8]: Miss Walker pretends that mamma was ill .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 9]: I know better , and so do you .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 14]: I said if she hit me again -- '' He caught her wrist .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 5]: `` Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 7]: he said in a firm whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 4]: `` Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 5]: You are hurting me .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: Why are you so horrid ?
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 9]: Do you want me to be beaten ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 13]: `` No ; but how can you dare threaten your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 18]: `` I would dare anything rather than be kept in the house -- away from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 48]: Frank Beckett-Smythe , sitting near his father , was wondering dully why he had been such a fool as to incur severe penalties for the sake of this `` silly kid , '' who was now ogling his rival and whispering coyly in that rival 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 11]: Martin was welcome to her , for all he cared .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 29]: No girl was worth the uneasiness of the chair he occupied , for his father 's hunting-crop had fallen with such emphasis that he felt the bruises yet .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 4]: The jury returned .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 8]: They had been absent half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 10]: Mr. Webster was flustered -- that was perceptible instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 11]: He , as foreman , had to deliver the finding .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 10]: `` Have you agreed as to your verdict ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 4]: said the Coroner .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 5]: `` We have . ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 6]: `` And it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 5]: `` Not guilty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 7]: `` What are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 7]: This is not a criminal court .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 13]: You are asked to determine how George Pickering met his death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 10]: `` I beg pardon , '' stammered Mr. Webster .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 7]: He turned anxiously to his colleagues .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 6]: Some of them prompted him .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 19]: `` I mean , '' he went on , `` that our verdict is ` Accidental death . '
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 6]: That 's it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: ` Accidental death , ' I should hev said .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 11]: Mr. Pickerin 's own words -- '' The Coroner frowned .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 11]: `` It is an amazing verdict , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 21]: `` I feel it my bounden duty -- '' Mr. Stockwell , pale but determined , sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 9]: `` Do hear me for one moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 16]: The Coroner did not answer , so the solicitor took advantage of the tacit permission .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 19]: `` I well recognize that the police can not let the matter rest here , '' he pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 10]: `` On your warrant they will arrest my client .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 6]: Such a proceeding is unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 11]: In her present state of health it might be fatal .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 18]: Surely it will suffice if you record your dissent and the inquiry is left to other authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 18]: I am sure that you , that Mr. Dane , will forgive the informality of my request .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 9]: It arises solely from motives of humanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 6]: The Coroner shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 16]: `` I am sorry , Mr. Stockwell , but I must discharge my duty conscientiously .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 22]: The verdict is against the weight of evidence , and the ultimate decision rests with me , not with the jury .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 21]: They have chosen deliberately to ignore my directions , and I have no option but to set aside their finding .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 16]: I am compelled to issue a warrant charging your client with ` wilful murder . '
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 30]: Protests only render the task more painful , and I may point out that , under any circumstances , the date of arrest can not be long deferred . ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 11]: A howl of vehement indignation came from the packed court .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 7]: Nearly everyone present sympathized with Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 19]: They accepted George Pickering 's dying declaration as final ; they regarded the Coroner 's attitude as outrageous .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 8]: For an instant the situation was threatening .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 20]: It looked as though the people would wrest the girl from the hands of the police by main force .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 32]: Old Mrs. Thwaites fainted , Kitty screamed dreadful words at the Coroner , and the girl 's father sprawled across the table with his face in his hands and crying pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 9]: Mr. Beckett-Smythe rose , but none would listen .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 8]: There was a scene of tense excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 25]: Already men were crowding to the center of the room , while an irresistible rush from outside drove a policeman headlong from the door .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 27]: Mr. Herbert strove to make himself heard , but an overwrought member of the jury bellowed : `` Mak ' him record oor vardict , parson .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 17]: What right hez he te go age√§n t ' opinion o ' twelve honest men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 33]: Solicitors and reporters gathered their papers hastily , fearing an instant onslaught on the Coroner , and someone chanced to step on Ang√®le 's foot as she clung in fright to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 15]: The child squealed loudly ; her toes had been squeezed under a heavy boot .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 46]: Fran√ßoise , whose broad Norman face depicted every sort of bewilderment at the tumult which had sprung up for some cause she in no way understood , rose at the child 's cry of anguish , and incontinently flung two pressmen out of her path .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 11]: She reached Ang√®le and faced the crowd with splendid courage .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 38]: The voluble harangue she poured forth in French , her uncommon costume , and fierce gesticulations gained her a hearing which would have been denied any other person in the room , save , perhaps , Betsy .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 29]: And Betsy was striving to bring her mother back to consciousness , without , however , departing in the least particular from her own attitude of stoic despair .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 9]: The Coroner availed himself of the momentary lull .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 22]: Fran√ßoise paused for sheer lack of breath , and Dr. Magnus made his voice heard far out into the village street .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 7]: `` Why all this excitement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 20]: `` The jury 's verdict will be recorded , but you can not force me to agree with it .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 13]: The police need not arrest Mrs. Pickering on my warrant at once .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 8]: I hope they will not do so .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 16]: Surely , as men of sense , you will not endeavor to defy the law ?
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 13]: You are injuring this poor woman 's cause by an unseemly turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 21]: Make way , there , at the door , and allow Mrs. Pickering to escort her mother to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 11]: You are frightening women and children by your bluster . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 18]: Mr. Stockwell joined the superintendent in appealing to the crowd to disperse , and the crisis passed .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 34]: In a few minutes the members of the Thwaites family were safe within the portals of the inn , and the schoolroom was empty of all save a few officials and busy reporters .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 19]: Fran√ßoise held fast to Ang√®le , but the girl appealed to Martin to accompany her a little way .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: He yielded , though he turned back before reaching the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 17]: `` Mother and I are coming to tea to-morrow , '' she cried as they parted .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 8]: `` All right , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 10]: `` Mind you do n't vex her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 4]: `` Not I .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 10]: She will want to hear all about the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 8]: It was as good as a play .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 5]: Was n't Fran√ßoise funny ?
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 10]: Oh , I do wish you had understood her .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 10]: She called the men ` sacr√©s cochons d'Anglais ! '
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 8]: It is so naughty in English . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 20]: On the green , and dotted about the roadway , excited groups discussed the lively episode in the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 21]: They were rancorous against the Coroner , and not a few boohed as he entered his carriage with Mr. Dane .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 27]: `` Ay , they 'd hang t ' poor lass , t ' pair of 'em , if they could , '' shouted a buxom woman .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 6]: `` She√§m on ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 3]: screamed another .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 17]: `` I 'll lay owt ye wo n't sleep soond i ' yer beds te-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 28]: But these vaporings broke no bones , and the Coroner drove away , glad enough that so far as he was concerned a distasteful experience had ended .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 13]: The persistent rain soon cleared loiterers from the center of the village .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 14]: John Bolland came to the farm while Martin was eating a belated meal .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 18]: `` A nice deed there was at t ' inquest , I hear , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 11]: `` I do n't know what 's come te Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 10]: It 's fair smitten wi ' a moral pestilence .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 27]: One reads o ' sike doin 's i ' foreign lands , but I nivver thowt te see 'em i ' this law-abidin ' counthry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 5]: Then Martha flared up .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 10]: `` Whe√§ 's i ' t ' fault ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 28]: `` Can ye ble√§m t ' folk for lossin ' their tempers when a daft Crowner cooms here an ' puts hissen up age√§n t ' jury ?
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 19]: If he had a bit o ' my tongue , I 'd teng -LRB- sting -RRB- him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 10]: So Elmsdale declared itself unhesitatingly on Betsy 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 16]: A dead man 's word carried more weight than all the law in the land .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 16]: CHAPTER XVI UNDERCURRENTS Undoubtedly the Coroner 's expedient had prevented a riot in the village .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 33]: The police deferred execution of the warrant , and Mr. Stockwell , recognizing the hopelessness of the situation , co-operated with them in making arrangements which would serve to allay public excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 14]: The dead man was removed unobtrusively to his Nottonby residence on Sunday evening .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 15]: Accompanying the hearse was a closed carriage in which rode Mrs. Pickering and Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 53]: At the door of Wetherby Lodge , Mr. Stockwell met the cort√®ge , and when the coffin was installed in the spacious library the solicitor introduced the weeping servants to their temporary mistress , since he and Mr. Herbert had decided that she ought to reside in the house for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 16]: Such a fact , when it became known , would help to mold public opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 12]: An elderly housekeeper was minded to greet Betsy with bitter words .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 28]: Her young master had been dear to her , and she had not scrupled earlier to denounce in scathing terms the woman who had encompassed his death .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 40]: But the sight of the wan , white face , the sorrow-laden eyes , the graceful , shrinking figure of the girl-widow , restrained an imminent outburst , and the inevitable reaction carried the housekeeper to the other extreme .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 13]: `` How d'ye do , ma'am , '' she said brokenly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 10]: 'T is a weary homecomin ' ye 've had .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: Mebbe ye 'll be likin ' a cup o ' tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 34]: Betsy murmured that she had no wants , but Yorkshire regards food as a panacea for most evils , and the housekeeper bade one of the maids `` put a kettle on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 22]: So the ice was broken , and Mr. Stockwell breathed freely again , for he had feared difficulty in this quarter .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 32]: On Monday Pickering was buried , and the whole countryside attended the funeral , which was made impressive by the drumming and marching of the dead man 's company of Territorials .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 18]: On Tuesday morning a special sitting of the county magistrates was held in the local police court .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 34]: Betsy attended with her solicitor , the Coroner 's warrant was enforced , she was charged by the police with the murder of George Pickering , and remanded for a week in custody .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 26]: The whole affair was carried out so unostentatiously that Betsy was in jail before the public knew that she had appeared at the police court .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 12]: In one short week the unhappy dairymaid had experienced sharp transitions .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 9]: She had become a wife , a widow .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 26]: She was raised from the condition of a wage-earner to the status of an independent lady , and taken from a mansion to a prison .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 41]: Bereft of her husband by her own act and separated from friends and relatives by the inexorable decree of the law , she was faced by the uncertain issue of a trial by an impartial judge and a strange jury .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 13]: Surely , the Furies were exhausting their spite on one frail creature .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 19]: On Sunday evening Mrs. Saumarez drove in her car through the rain to tea at the White House .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 4]: She was alone .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 31]: Her manner was more reserved than usual , though she shook hands with Mrs. Bolland with a quiet friendliness that more than atoned for the perceptible change in her demeanor .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: Her wonted air of affable condescension had gone .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 15]: Her face held a new seriousness which the other woman was quick to perceive .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 16]: `` I have come to have a little chat with you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 8]: `` I am going away soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 8]: The farmer 's wife thought she understood .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 13]: `` I 'm rale sorry te hear that , yer leddyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 9]: `` Indeed , I regret the necessity myself .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 32]: But recent events have opened my eyes to the danger of allowing my child to grow up in the untrammeled freedom which I have permitted -- encouraged , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 10]: It breaks my heart to be stern toward her .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 26]: I must send her to the South , where there are good schools , where others will fulfil obligations in which I have failed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 4]: And , behold !
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 7]: Mrs. Saumarez choked back a sob .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 19]: `` Eh , ma'am , '' cried the perturbed Martha , `` there 's nowt to greet aboot .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: T ' lass is young eneuf yet , an ' she 's a bonny bairn , bless her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 9]: We all hae te part wi ' 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 22]: It 'll trouble me sore when Martin goes away , but ` twill be for t ' lad 's good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 13]: `` You dear woman , you have nothing to reproach yourself with .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 3]: I have .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 34]: Your fine boy would never dream of rending your soul as Ang√®le has rent mine to-day -- all because I wished her to read an instructive book instead of a French novel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 17]: `` Mebbe you were a bit hard wi ' her , '' said the older woman .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 25]: `` To be sure , ye would n't be suited by this nasty inquest ; but is it wise to change all at once ?
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 15]: Slow an ' sure , ma'am , is better 'n fast an ' feckless .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 10]: Where is t ' little ` un now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 18]: `` At home , crying her eyes out because I insisted that she should remain there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 15]: `` Ay , I reckon she 'd be wantin ' te see Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 14]: `` Do you think I may have been too severe with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 40]: `` It 's not for t ' likes o ' me to advise a leddy like you , but yon bairn needs to be treated gently , for all t ' wulld like a bit o ' delicate chiney .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 31]: Noo , when Martin was younger , I 'd gie him a slap ower t ' head , an ' he 'd grin t ' minnit me back was turned .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 7]: Your little gell is different . ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 14]: `` In my place , would you go back for her now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 9]: `` No , ma'am , I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 5]: That 'd show weak .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 10]: But I 'd mek up for ' t te-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 14]: Then she 'll think all t ' more o ' yer kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 7]: So the regeneration of Ang√®le commenced .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 5]: Was it too late ?
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 8]: She was only a child in years .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 13]: Surely there was yet time to mold her character in better shape .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 5]: Mrs. Saumarez hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 20]: She dried her tears , and , with Bolland 's appearance , the conversation turned on the lamentable weather .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 27]: She was surprised to hear that August was often an unsettled month , though this storm was not only belated but almost unprecedented in its severity .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 9]: Mr. Herbert went to Nottonby early next day .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 44]: He attended the funeral , heard the will read at Wetherby Grange in the presence of some disappointed cousins of the dead man , visited Betsy to say a few consoling words , and drove back to the vicarage through the unceasing rain .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 16]: Tea awaited him in the drawing-room , but his first glance at Elsie alarmed him .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 9]: Her face was flushed , her eyes red .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 8]: She was a most woebegone little maid .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 16]: `` My dear child , '' he cried , `` what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 16]: `` I want you -- to forgive me -- first , '' she stammered brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 7]: `` Forgive you , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 6]: Forgive you for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 10]: `` I 've been -- reading the paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 7]: He drew her to his knee .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 14]: `` What crime is there in reading the paper , sweet one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 11]: `` I mean that horrid inquest , father dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 7]: The smiling wonder left his face .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 5]: Elsie looked up timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 53]: `` I ought to have asked your permission , '' she said , `` but you were away , and auntie has a headache , and Miss Holland -LRB- her governess -RRB- has gone on her holidays , and I was so curious to know what all the bother was about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 6]: Yet he did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 20]: Hitherto his daughter , his one cherished possession , had been kept sedulously from knowledge of the external world .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 17]: But she was shooting up , slender and straight , the image of her dead mother .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 39]: Soon she would be a woman , and it was no part of his theory of life that a girl should be plunged into the jungle of adult existence without a reasonable consciousness of its snares and pitfalls .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 19]: So ideal were the relations of father and daughter that the vicar had deferred the day of enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 9]: It had come sooner than he counted on .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 5]: Elsie was frightened now .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 10]: Her tears ceased and the flush left her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 7]: `` Are you very angry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 4]: He kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 14]: `` No , darling , not angry , but just a little pained .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 9]: It was an unpleasing record for your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 4]: There , now .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 12]: Give me some tea , and we 'll talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 8]: You may have formed some mistaken notions .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 9]: Tell me what you thought of it all .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 12]: In any case , Elsie , why were you crying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 10]: `` I was so sorry for that poor woman .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 22]: And why did the Coroner believe she killed her husband , when Mr. Pickering said she had not touched him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 17]: The vicar saw instantly that the girl had missed the more unpleasing phases of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 4]: He smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 10]: `` Bring me the paper , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 8]: `` I was present at the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 8]: Perhaps the story is somewhat garbled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 3]: She obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 42]: He cast a critical glance over the leaded columns , for the weekly newspaper had given practically a verbatim report of the evidence , and there was a vivid description of the scene in the schoolroom , with its dramatic close .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 25]: `` It is by no means certain , from the evidence tendered , that the Coroner is right , '' said Mr. Herbert slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 28]: `` In these matters , however , the police are compelled to sift all statements thoroughly , and the only legal way is to frame a charge .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 20]: Although Mrs. Pickering may be tried for murder , it does not follow that she will be convicted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 24]: `` But , '' questioned Elsie , `` Martin Bolland said he heard her crying out that she had killed Mr. Pickering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 7]: `` He may have misunderstood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 16]: `` Just imagine him fighting with Frank , and about Ang√®le Saumarez , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 14]: `` You may take it from me that Martin behaved very well indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 16]: Ang√®le is a little vixen , a badly behaved , spoilt child , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 10]: Young Beckett-Smythe is a booby who encouraged her wilfulness .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 4]: Martin thrashed him .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 29]: It would have been far better had Martin not been there at all ; but if he were my son I should still be proud of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 7]: The girl 's face brightened visibly .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 8]: There was manifest relief in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 15]: `` I am so glad we 've had this talk , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 22]: `` I -- like Martin , and it did seem so odd that he should have been fighting about Ang√®le . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 15]: `` He knew she ought to be at home , and told her so .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 10]: Frank interfered , and got punched for his pains .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 6]: It served him right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 10]: She helped herself to a large slice of tea-cake .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 28]: `` I do n't know why I was so silly as to cry -- but -- I really did think Mrs. Pickering was in awful trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 7]: The vicar laid the paper aside .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 17]: His innocent-minded daughter had not even given a thought to the vital issues of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 11]: He breathed freely , and told her of the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 14]: Nevertheless , he had failed to fathom the cause of those red eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 20]: A servant clearing the tea-table bethought her of a note which came for Mr. Herbert some two hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 7]: She brought it from the study .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 15]: It was from Mrs. Saumarez , inviting him and Elsie to luncheon next day .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 19]: `` Ang√®le will be delighted , '' she wrote , `` if Elsie will remain longer than usual .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 15]: It is dull for children to be cooped within doors during this miserable weather .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 12]: I am asking Martin Bolland to join us for tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 21]: Mr. Herbert was a kind-hearted man , yet he wished most emphatically that Mrs. Saumarez had not proffered this request .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 35]: To make an excuse for his daughter 's non-attendance would convey a distinct slight which could only be interpreted in one way , after the publicity given to Ang√®le 's appearance at the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 5]: He shirked the ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 3]: Bother Ang√®le !
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 6]: He glanced covertly at Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 19]: All unconscious of the letter 's contents , the girl was looking out ruefully at the leaden sky .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 9]: There might be no more picnics for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 13]: `` Mrs. Saumarez has invited us to luncheon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 4]: she asked unconcernedly .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 3]: `` To-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 11]: She wishes you to spend the afternoon with Ang√®le . ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 7]: Elsie turned , with quick animation .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 12]: `` I do n't care to go , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 8]: You know very little about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: `` She seems to me -- curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 16]: `` Well , I personally do n't regard her as a desirable companion for you .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 24]: But there is no need to give offense , and it will not hurt you to meet her for an hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 9]: Your friend Martin is coming , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 15]: `` Oh , '' she cried , `` that makes a great difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 4]: Her father laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 15]: `` Between you , you will surely manage to keep Ang√®le out of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 25]: And , now , my pet , what do you say to an hour with La Fontaine , while I attend to some correspondence ?
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 6]: Where are my pupils ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 8]: `` They went for a long walk .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 12]: Mr. Gregory said they would not be home until dinner-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 24]: Next morning , for a wonder , the clouds broke , and an autumn sun strove to cheer the scarred and drowned earth .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 14]: Mrs. Saumarez met her guests with the unobtrusive charm of a skilled hostess .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 26]: Ang√®le , demure and shrinking , extended her hand to Elsie with a shy civility that was an exact copy of Elsie 's own attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 30]: During luncheon she behaved so charmingly and spoke with such sweet naturalness when any question was addressed to her that Mr. Herbert found himself steadily recasting his unfavorable opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 11]: The conversation steered clear of any reference to the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 20]: Mrs. Saumarez was a widely read and traveled woman , and versed in the art of agreeable small talk .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 24]: Once , in referring to Ang√®le , she said smilingly : `` I have been somewhat selfish in keeping her with me always .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 14]: But , now , I have decided that she must go to school .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 13]: I 'll winter in Brighton , with that object in view . ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 7]: `` Will you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 7]: said the vicar to the child .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 13]: `` I 'll not like leaving mamma ; but school , yes .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 9]: I feel I want to learn a lot .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 11]: I suppose Elsie is , oh , so clever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 29]: She peeped at the other girl under her long eyelashes , and made pretense of being awe-stricken by such eminent scholastic attainments in one of her own age .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 20]: `` Elsie has learnt a good deal from books , but you have seen much more of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 15]: If you work hard , you will soon make up the lost ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 5]: `` I 'll try .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 9]: I have been trying -- all day yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 5]: Eh , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 4]: Mrs. Saumarez sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 13]: `` I ought to have engaged a governess , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 6]: `` I can not teach .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 6]: I have no patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 25]: Mr. Herbert did not know that Ang√®le 's educational efforts of the preceding day consisted in a smug decorum that irritated her mother exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 14]: This luncheon party had been devised as a relief from Ang√®le 's burlesque .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 10]: She termed it `` jouer le bon enfant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 9]: After the meal they strolled into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 27]: The storm had played havoc with shrubs and flowers , but the graveled paths were dry , and the lawn was firm , if somewhat damp .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 15]: Mrs. Saumarez had caused a fine swing to be erected beneath a spreading oak .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 16]: It held two cushioned seats , and two propelling ropes were attached to a crossbar .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 10]: It made swinging a luxury , not an exercise .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 19]: `` By the way , '' cried Mrs. Saumarez to the vicar , `` do you smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 7]: He pleaded guilty to a pipe .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 8]: `` Then you can smoke a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 18]: Fran√ßoise packed a box among my belongings -- the remnants of some forgotten festivity in the Savoy .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 4]: Do try one .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 13]: If you like it , may I send you the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 20]: The vicar discovered that the gift would be costly -- nearly forty Villar y Villars , of exquisite flavor .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 13]: `` Do you know that you are giving me five pounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 10]: `` I never learn the price of these things .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 8]: I am so glad they are good .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 6]: You will enjoy them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 20]: `` It tickles a poor country vicar to hear you talk so easily of Lucullian feasts , Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 16]: What must the banquet have been , when the cigars cost a half-crown each ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 9]: `` Oh , I am not hard up .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 28]: Colonel Saumarez had only his army pay , but my estates lie near Hamburg , and you know how that port has grown of recent years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 8]: `` Do you never reside there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 22]: Mrs. Saumarez inclined a pink-lined parasol so that its reflected tint mingled with the rush of color which suffused her face .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 32]: Had the worthy vicar given a moment 's thought to the matter , he would have known that his companion wished she had bitten her tongue before it wagged so freely .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 17]: `` I prefer English society to German , '' she answered , after a slight pause .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 38]: Oddly enough , this statement was literally true , but she dared not qualify it by the explanation that an autocratic government exacted heavy terms for permitting her to draw a large revenue from her Hamburg property .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 15]: Blissfully unaware of treading on anyone 's toes , Mr. Herbert pursued the theme .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 16]: `` In my spare hours I take an interest in law , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 9]: `` Your marriage made you a British subject .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 16]: Does German law raise no difficulty as to alien ownership of land and houses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 13]: `` My family , the von Edelsteins , have great influence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 16]: This time the vicar awoke to the fact that he might be deemed unduly inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 14]: He knew better than to apologize , or even change the subject abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 16]: `` Land tenure is a complex business in old-established countries , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 8]: `` Take this village , for example .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 18]: You may have noticed how every garth runs up the hillside in a long , narrow strip .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 32]: Ownership of land bordering the moor carries the right of free grazing for a certain number of sheep , so every freeholder contrives to touch the heather at some point . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 25]: said Mrs. Saumarez , promptly interested , `` that explains the peculiar shape of the Bolland land at the back of the White House .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 8]: An admirable couple , are they not ?
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 7]: And so medieval in their notions .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 14]: I attended what they call a ` love feast ' the other evening .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 10]: John Bolland introduced me as ` Sister Saumarez . '
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 28]: When he became wrapped up in the service he reminded me , or , rather , filled my ideal , of a high priest in Israel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 7]: `` Was Eli Todd there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 4]: `` The preacher ?
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 7]: `` He is a fine fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 20]: Given to use a spiritual sledge-hammer , perhaps , but the implements of the Lord are many and varied .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 16]: Far be it from me to gainsay the good work done by the dissenting congregations .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 19]: If there were more chapels , there would be more churches in the land , Mrs. Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 23]: They had strolled away from the girls , and little did the vicar dream what deeps they had skirted in their talk .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 7]: Ang√®le led Elsie to the swing .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 8]: `` Try this , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 15]: `` It 's just lovely to feel the air sizzing past your ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 17]: `` I have a swing , '' said Elsie , `` but not like this one .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 23]: It is a single rope , with a little crossbar , which I hold in my hands and propel with my feet .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 10]: It is hard work , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 4]: `` Grand Dieu !
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 6]: So I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: cried Elsie , `` you should n't say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 6]: `` Vous me faites rire !
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 5]: You speak French ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 7]: `` Yes -- a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 9]: `` How stupid of me not to guess .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 10]: I can say what I like before Martin Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 9]: He is a nice boy -- Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' agreed Elsie shortly .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 3]: She blushed .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 16]: They were in the swing now , and swooping to and fro in long rushes .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 11]: Ang√®le 's black eyes were searching Elsie 's blue ones .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 4]: She tittered unpleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 13]: `` What makes you so red when I speak of Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 17]: `` I am not red -- that is , I have no reason to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 7]: `` You know him well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 7]: `` Do you mean Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 3]: `` Sapristi !
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 10]: -- I beg your pardon -- who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 14]: `` I -- I have only met him twice , to speak to .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 10]: I have known him by sight for years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: `` Twice ?
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 12]: The first time when he killed that thing -- the cat .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 6]: When was the second ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 19]: Ang√®le was tugging her rope with greater energy than might be credited to one of her slight frame .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 9]: The swing was traveling at a great pace .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 13]: Her fierce gaze disquieted Elsie , to whom this inquisition was irksome .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 10]: `` Let us stop now , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 8]: Tell me when next you saw Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 7]: I _ must _ know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 12]: `` Because he became different in his manner all at once .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 17]: One day he kissed me -- '' `` Oh , you _ are _ horrid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 5]: `` I swear it .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 7]: He kissed me last Wednesday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 9]: I did not see him again until Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 5]: Then he was cold .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 7]: He saw you after Wednesday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 9]: By this time Elsie 's blood was boiling .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' she said , and the blue in her eyes held a hard glint .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 8]: `` He saw me on Wednesday night .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 9]: We happened to be standing at our gate .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 7]: Frank Beckett-Smythe passed on his bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 22]: He was chased by a groom -- sent home to be horsewhipped -- because he was coming to meet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 6]: `` O l√† l√† ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 3]: shrilled Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 6]: `` That was nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 5]: Does papa know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 10]: Poor Elsie crimsoned to the nape of her neck .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 12]: She wanted to cry -- to slap this tormentor 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 10]: Yet she returned Ang√®le 's fiery scrutiny with interest .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' she said with real heat .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 20]: `` I told him Martin came to our house , but I said nothing about Frank -- and you .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 6]: It was too disgraceful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 14]: She jerked viciously at her rope to counteract the pull given by Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 7]: The opposing strains snapped the crossbar .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 13]: Both ropes fell , and with them the two pieces of wood .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 17]: One piece tapped Ang√®le somewhat sharply on the shoulder , and she uttered an involuntary cry .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 14]: The vicar and Mrs. Saumarez hurried up , but the swing stopped gradually .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 9]: Obviously , neither of the girls was injured .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 24]: `` You must have been using great force to break that stout bar , '' said Mr. Herbert , helping Ang√®le to alight .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 9]: Elsie and I were pulling against each other .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 14]: But we had a lovely time , did n't we , Elsie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 15]: `` I think I enjoyed it even more than you , '' retorted Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 10]: The elders attributed her excited demeanor to the accident .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 25]: `` If the ropes were tied to the crossbeam , they would be safer , and almost as effective , '' said the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 4]: Here comes Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 8]: Perhaps he can put matters right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 14]: `` I do n't want to swing any more , '' vowed Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 9]: `` But Martin will , '' laughed Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 6]: `` We can swop partners .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 10]: That will be jolly , wo n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 12]: Blissfully unaware of the thorns awaiting him , the boy advanced .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 11]: To be candid , he was somewhat awkward in manner .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 20]: He did not know whether to shake hands all round or simply doff his cap to the entire company .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 23]: Moreover , he noted Elsie 's presence with mixed feelings , for Mrs. Saumarez 's note had merely invited him to tea .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 8]: There was no mention of other visitors .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 7]: He was delighted , yet suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 8]: Elsie and Ang√®le were flint and steel .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 5]: There might be sparks .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 11]: Mrs. Saumarez rescued him from one horn of the dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 18]: She extended a hand and asked if Mr. Bolland were not pleased that the rain had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 24]: `` Now , Martin , '' said the vicar briskly , `` shin up the pole and tie the ropes to the center-piece .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 15]: These strong-armed giantesses have smashed a chunk of timber as thick as your wrist .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 10]: Do n't allow either of them to hit you .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 9]: They 'll pulverize you at a stroke . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 14]: `` I fear it was I who broke it , '' admitted Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 11]: `` Then it is you he must beware of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 24]: The vicar , in the midst of this chaff , gave Martin a `` leg-up '' the pole , and repairs were effected .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 12]: When the swing was in order he slid to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 9]: Mr. Herbert resumed the stroll with Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 15]: There was an awkward pause before Martin said : `` You girls get in .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 6]: I 'll start you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 8]: He spoke collectively , but addressed Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 9]: He wondered why her air was so distant .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: `` No , thank you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 9]: `` I 've done damage enough already . ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 19]: `` Martin , '' murmured Ang√®le , `` she is furious because I said you kissed me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 8]: This direct attack was a crude blunder .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 21]: Mischievous and utterly unscrupulous though the girl was , she could not measure this boy 's real strength of character .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 25]: The great man is not daunted by great difficulties -- he grapples with them ; and Martin had in him the material of greatness .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 31]: He felt at once that he must now choose irrevocably between the two girls , with a most unpromising chance of ever again recovering lost ground with one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 7]: He did not hesitate an instant .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 7]: `` Did you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 4]: he demanded sternly .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 4]: `` Ma foi !
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 6]: Is n't it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 8]: `` The truth may be an insult .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 14]: You had no right to thrust your schemes into Elsie 's knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 9]: `` My schemes , you -- you pig .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 5]: I spit at you .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 6]: Is n't it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 5]: `` Yes -- unfortunately .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 7]: I shall regret it always . ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 9]: Ang√®le nearly flew at him with her nails .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 7]: But she contrived to laugh airily .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 8]: `` Eh bien , mon cher Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 6]: There will come another time .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 5]: I shall remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 8]: `` There will come no other time .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 6]: You dared me to it .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 12]: I was stupid enough to forget -- for a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 5]: `` Forget what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 22]: `` That there was a girl in Elmsdale worth fifty of you -- an English girl , not a mongrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 20]: It was a boyish retort , feeble , unfair , but the most cutting thing he could think of .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 27]: The words were spoken in heat ; he would have recalled them at once if that were possible , but Ang√®le seized the opening with glee .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 6]: `` That 's you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: she cried , stabbing her rival with a finger .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 3]: `` Parbleu !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 17]: I 'm a mixture , half English , half German , but really bad French ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 18]: `` Please do n't drag me into your interesting conversation , '' said Elsie with bitter politeness .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 14]: `` I am sorry I said that , '' put in the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 8]: `` I might have had two friends .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 7]: Now I have lost both . ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 3]: He turned .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 9]: His intent was to quit the place forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 9]: Elsie caught his arm with an alarmed cry .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 15]: `` Martin , '' she almost screamed , `` look at your left hand .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 7]: It is covered with blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 9]: Surprised as she , he raised his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 7]: Blood was streaming down the fingers .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 10]: `` It 's nothing , '' he said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 14]: `` I must have opened a deep cut by climbing the swing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 5]: `` Quelle horreur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 3]: exclaimed Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 6]: `` I hate blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 10]: `` I 'm awfully sorry -- '' began Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 16]: Come at once to the kitchen and have it bound up , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 5]: They hurried off together .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 8]: Ang√®le did not offer to accompany them .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 11]: Martin glanced at Elsie through the corner of his eye .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 7]: Her set mouth had relaxed somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 6]: Anger was yielding to sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 18]: `` I was fighting another wildcat , so was sure to get scratched , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 14]: `` You need n't have kissed it , anyhow , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 13]: `` That , certainly , was a mistake , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 5]: She made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 26]: Once within the house she removed the stained bandage without flinching from the ugly sight of half-healed scars , one of which was bleeding profusely .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 26]: Cold water soon stopped the outflow , and one of the maids procured some strips of linen , with which Elsie bound the wound tightly .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 11]: They had a moment to themselves in recrossing the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 9]: Martin ventured to touch the girl 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 18]: `` Look here , Elsie , '' he said boldly , `` do you forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 14]: Something in his voice told her that mere verbal fencing would be useless .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' she murmured with a wistful smile .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 17]: `` I 'll forgive , but I ca n't forget -- for a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 8]: On the lawn they encountered Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 20]: Learning from Ang√®le why the trio had dispersed so suddenly , she was coming to attend to Martin herself .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 5]: The vicar joined them .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 21]: `` Really , '' he said , `` some sort of ill luck is attached to that swing to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 13]: And then Fran√ßoise appeared , to tell them that tea was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 13]: `` What curious French she talks , '' commented the smiling Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' cried Ang√®le tartly .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 6]: `` Bad French , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 10]: And I know heaps and heaps of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 21]: She caught Mr. Herbert 's eye , and added an excuse : `` I 'm going to change all that .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 12]: People think I 'm naughty when I speak like a domestic .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 10]: And I really do n't mean anything wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 14]: `` We all use too much slang , '' said the tolerant-minded vicar .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 6]: `` It is sheer indolence .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 12]: We refuse to bother our brains for the right word . ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 36]: CHAPTER XVII TWO MOORLAND EPISODES Though all hands were needed on the farm in strenuous endeavor to repair the storm 's havoc , Dr. MacGregor forbade Martin to work when he examined the reopened cut .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 26]: Thus , the boy was free to guide Fritz , the chauffeur , on the morning the man came to look at Bolland 's herd .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 20]: Fritz Bauer -- that was the name he gave -- had improved his English pronunciation marvelously within a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 14]: He no longer confused `` d 's '' and `` t 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 51]: He had conquered the sibilant sound of the `` s. '' He was even wrestling with the elusive `` th , '' substituting `` d '' for `` z. '' `` I learnt from a book , '' he explained , when Martin complimented him on his mastery of English .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 32]: `` Dat is goot -- no , good -- but one trains de ear only in de country where de people spik -- speak -- de language all de time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 55]: The sharp-witted boy soon came to the conclusion that his German friend was more interested in the money value of the cattle as pedigreed stock than in the `` points '' -- such as weight , color , bone , level back , and milking qualities -- which commended them to the experienced eye .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 18]: Bauer asked where he could obtain a show catalogue , and jotted down the printer 's address .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 34]: When they happened on a team of Cleveland bays , however , Fritz was thoroughly at home , and gratified his hearer by displaying a horseman 's knowledge of a truly superb animal .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 25]: `` Dey are light , yet strong , '' he said , his eyes roving from high-set withers to shapely hocks and clean-cut fetlocks .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 14]: `` Each could pull a ton on a bad road -- yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 3]: Martin laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 13]: He was blind to the cynical smile called forth by his amusement .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 4]: `` A ton ?
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 3]: Two tons .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 43]: Why , one day last winter , when a pair of Belgians could n't move a loaded lorry in the deep snow , my father had the man take out both of 'em , and Prince walked away with the lot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 4]: `` So ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 5]: cried the German admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 11]: `` But you understand horses , '' went on Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 22]: `` Yet I 've read that men who drive motors do n't care for anything else , as a rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 12]: `` Ah , dat reminds me , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 7]: `` It is a fine day .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 8]: Come wid me in de machine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 11]: `` That 'll be grand , '' said Martin elatedly .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 8]: `` Can you take it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 21]: Any time I -- dat is , I 'll ask Mrs. Saumarez , and she will permit -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 34]: Quarter of an hour later the chauffeur was explaining , in German , that he was going into the country for a long spin , and Mrs. Saumarez was listening , not consenting .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 5]: `` Going alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 4]: she inquired languidly .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 9]: `` No , madam , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 9]: `` Martin Bolland will come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 8]: `` Why not take Miss Ang√®le ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 4]: The man smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 12]: `` I want the boy to talk , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 4]: Mrs. Saumarez nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 7]: She treated the matter with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 19]: Not so Ang√®le , who heard the car purring down the drive , and inquired Fritz 's errand .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 16]: She was furious when her mother blurted out the news that Martin would accompany Bauer .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 6]: `` Ce cochon d'Allemand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 11]: she stormed , her long lashes wet with vexed tears .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 7]: `` He has done that purposely .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 7]: He knew I wanted to go .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 8]: But I 'll get even with him !
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 7]: See if I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 4]: `` Ang√®le ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 30]: and Mrs. Saumarez reddened with annoyance ; `` if ever you say a word about such matters to Fritz I 'll pack you off to school within the hour .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 9]: I mean it , so believe me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 13]: Ang√®le stamped a rebellious foot , but curbed her tongue and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 30]: She ran all the way to the village and was just in time to see the Mercedes bowling smoothly out of sight , with Martin seated beside the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 23]: She was so angry that she stamped again in rage , and Evelyn Atkinson came from the inn to inquire the cause .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 21]: But Ang√®le snubbed her , bought some chocolates from Mr. Webster , and never offered the other girl a taste .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 17]: It happened that Martin , for his part , had suggested a call at the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 6]: Fritz vetoed the motion promptly .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 3]: he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 12]: `` I had to dodge de odder one , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 10]: Evidently Fritz had kept both eyes and ears open .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 6]: They headed for the moors .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 49]: Wise Martin had counseled a slow speed in the village to allay Mrs. Bolland 's dread of a new-fangled device which she `` could n't abide '' ; but once on the open road the car breasted a steep hill at a rate which the boy thought neck-breaking .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 10]: `` Dat is nodding , '' said Fritz nonchalantly .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 5]: `` Twenty -- twenty-five .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 8]: Wait till we are on de level .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 7]: Den I show you fifty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 12]: Within six minutes Martin flew past Mrs. Summersgill 's moor-edge farm .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 14]: Never before had he reached that point in less than half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 15]: The stout party was in the porch , peeling potatoes for the midday meal .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 13]: She lifted her hands in astonishment as her young friend sped by .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 5]: Martin waved a greeting .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 21]: He could almost hear her say : `` That lad o ' Bolland 's must ha ' gone clean daft .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 16]: I 'm surprised at Martha te let him ride i ' such a conthraption . ''
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 27]: On the hedgeless road of the undulating moor , even after the ravages of the gale , fifty miles an hour was practicable for long stretches .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 6]: Fritz was a skilled driver .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 22]: He seemed to have a sixth sense which warned him of rain-gullies , and slowed up to avoid straining the car .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 32]: He began explaining the mechanism , and halted on the highest point of a far-flung tableland to lift the bonnet and show the delighted boy the operations of the Otto cycle .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 21]: In those days the self-starter was unknown , but Martin found he could start the heated engine without any difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 16]: Fritz permitted him to drive slowly , and taught him the use of the brakes .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 12]: Finally , this most agreeable Teuton produced a packet of sandwiches .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 8]: He was in no hurry to return .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 34]: `` Dese farms , '' he said , pointing to a low-built house with tiled roof , and a cluster of stables and haymows , `` dey do not raise stock , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 5]: Only little sheep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 27]: `` They all keep milk-cows , and bring butter to the market , so they often have calves and yearlings , '' was the ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 5]: `` And horses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 14]: `` Always a couple , and a nag for counting the sheep . ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 6]: `` How many sheep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 7]: `` Never less than a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 10]: Some flocks run to three or four hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 5]: Where are dey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 30]: Martin , proud of his knowledge , indicated the position and approximate distance of the hollows , invisible for the most part , in which lay the larger holdings .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 8]: `` Do you understand a map ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 3]: inquired Fritz .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 4]: I love maps .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 13]: They tell you everything , when you can read them properly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 10]: `` Not everyding , '' and the man smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 13]: `` Some day I want to visit one of dose big farms .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 7]: Can you mark a few ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 17]: He spread an Ordnance map -- a clean sheet -- and gave his guide a pencil .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 24]: Soon Martin had dotted the paper with accurate information , such as none but one reared in that wild country could have supplied .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 31]: He was eager to prove his familiarity with a map , and followed each bend and twist of the prehistoric glacier beds , where the lowland becks had their origin .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 11]: He was not `` showing off '' before a foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 17]: He loved this brown moor and was only too pleased to have found a sympathetic listener .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 21]: `` The heather is losing its color now , '' he said , pausing for a moment in his task .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 38]: `` You ought to see it early in August , when it is all one mass of purple flowers , with here and there a bunch of golden gorse -- ` whin , ' we call it .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 18]: Our moor is almost free from bog-holes , so you can walk or ride anywhere with safety .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 16]: I have often thought what a fine place it would be for an army . ''
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 6]: `` Wass ist das ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: cried Fritz sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 8]: He corrected the slip with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 5]: `` An army ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 12]: he went on , though his newly acquired accent escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 10]: `` Vot woot an army pe toing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 10]: `` Oh , just a camp , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 9]: We hold maneuvers every year in England . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 3]: `` Yez .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 11]: You coot pud all your leedle army on dis grount .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 7]: Bud dere iss von grade tefecd .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 5]: Dere iss no water .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 26]: A vell , in eej farm , yez ; bud nod enough for a hundret dousand men , und de horses of four divisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 10]: This point of view was novel to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 5]: He knit his brows .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 12]: `` I had n't thought of that , '' he confessed .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 7]: `` But , wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 11]: There 's far more water here than you would imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 9]: Stocks have to be watered , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 8]: Some of the farmers dam the becks .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 29]: Why , in the Dickenson place over there , '' and out went a hand , `` they have quite a large reservoir , with trout in it .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 14]: You 'd never guess it existed , if you were n't told . ''
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 3]: Fritz nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 20]: He had turned against the breeze to shield a match for a cigarette , and his face was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 16]: `` You surprise me , '' he murmured , speaking slowly and with care again .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 10]: `` And dere are odders , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 7]: `` Five that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 17]: Mrs. Walker , at the Broad Ings , rears hundreds of ducks on her pond . ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 7]: Fritz took the map and pencil .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 9]: `` You show me , '' he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 21]: `` I write an essay on Yorkshire moor farms , and perhaps earn a new suit of clo'es , yes ?
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 8]: Our Cherman magazines print dose tings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 33]: * * * * * That same afternoon a party of guns on a Scottish moor had been shooting driven grouse flying low and fast over the butts before a strong wind .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 11]: The sportsmen , five in number , were all experts .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 25]: Around each shelter , with its solitary marksman and his attendant loader , lay a deep crescent of game , every bird shot cleanly .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 11]: The last drive of the day was the most successful .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 58]: One man , whose bronzed skin and military bearing told his profession , handed the empty 12-bore to the gillie when the line of beaters came over the crest of the hill , and betook himself , filling his pipe the while , to a group of ponies waiting on the moorland road in the valley beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 8]: He joined another , the earliest arrival .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 10]: `` Capital ground , this , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 42]: `` I do n't know whose lot is the more enviable , Heronsdale -- yours , who have the pains as well as the pleasure of ownership , or that of wandering vagabonds like myself whom you make your guests . ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 4]: Lord Heronsdale smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 21]: `` You may call yourself a wandering vagabond , Grant -- the envy rests with me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 27]: `` It 's all very well to have large estates , but I feel like degenerating into a sort of head gamekeeper and farm bailiff combined .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 27]: Of course , I 'm proud of Cairn-corrie , yet I pine sometimes for the excitement of a life that does not travel in grooves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 6]: The other shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 10]: `` Do n't tempt fate , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 11]: `` My life has been spent among the outer beasts .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 6]: It is n't worth it .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 14]: For a few years of a man 's youth , yes -- perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 12]: But I am forty , and I live in a club .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 11]: There , you have my career in a nutshell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 8]: `` There is a fine kernel within .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 3]: By Gad !
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 12]: Grant , why do n't you pretend I meant that pun ?
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 12]: I did n't , but I 'll claim it at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 7]: Gad , it 's fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 4]: Colonel Grant laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 9]: His mirth had a pleasant , wholesome ring .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 36]: `` If you bribe me with as good a berth to-morrow , '' he said , `` I 'll give you the chance of throwing it off spontaneously during the first lull in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 12]: The best impromptus are always prepared beforehand , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 4]: Others came up .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 19]: The shooters mounted , and the wise ponies picked their way with cautious celerity over an uneven track .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 10]: Colonel Grant again found himself riding beside his host .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 23]: `` Tell you what , '' said Lord Heronsdale suddenly , `` you 're a bit of an enigma , Grant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 9]: `` I have often been told that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 9]: `` Gad , I do n't doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 51]: A chap like you , with five thousand a year , to chuck the Guards for the Indian Staff Corps , exchange town for the Northwest frontier , go in for potting Afghans instead of running a drag to Sandown ; and , to crown all , remain a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 7]: I do n't understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 24]: `` Yet , ten minutes ago you were growling about the monotony of existence at Cairn-corrie and half a dozen other places . ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 15]: `` Not even a _ tu quoque _ like that explains the mystery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 11]: `` Some day I 'll tell you all about it .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 21]: When the time comes I must ask Lady Heronsdale to find me a nice wife , with a warranty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 10]: `` Gad , that 's the job for Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 13]: _ She 'll _ put the future Mrs. Grant through her paces .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 12]: You 're not flying off to India again , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 19]: I heard last week that a post is to be found for me in the Intelligence Department . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 3]: `` Capital !
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 14]: You 'll soon have a K. before the C. B. '' `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 13]: Some fellows wear themselves to the bone in trying for those things .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 14]: My scheming for years has been to avoid the humdrum of cantonment life .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 4]: And , behold !
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 6]: I am spotted for promotion .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 17]: I do n't know how the deuce they ever heard of me in Pall Mall . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 8]: Do n't you read the papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 13]: `` My dear fellow , they were full of you last year .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 27]: That march through the snow , pulling those guns through the pass , the final relief of the fort -- Gad , Molly has the cuttings .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 10]: She 'll show 'em to you after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 12]: `` I sincerely hope Lady Heronsdale will do no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 10]: Why on earth does she keep such screeds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 7]: His lordship dropped his bantering air .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 31]: `` Do you really imagine , Grant , '' he said seriously , `` that either she or I will ever forget what you did for Arthur at Peshawar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 5]: The other man reddened .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 10]: `` A mere schoolboy episode , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 7]: `` Yes , in a sense .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 32]: Yet Arthur told me that he had a revolver in his pocket when you met him that night at the mess and persuaded him to leave the business in your hands .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 7]: You saved our boy , Grant .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 9]: Gad , ask Mollie what she thinks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 8]: `` Has he been steady since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 14]: `` A rock , my dear chap -- adamant where women are concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 26]: His mother is beginning to worry about him ; he would n't look at Helen Forbes , and Madge Bolingbrooke does her skirt-dances in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 8]: Both deuced nice girls , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 16]: Colonel Grant had navigated the talk into a safe channel , and kept it there .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 7]: He never spoke of the past .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 14]: At dinner a man asked him if he was reading the Elmsdale sensation .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 29]: He had not even heard of it , so the tale of Betsy and George Pickering , of Martin Bolland and Ang√®le Saumarez was poured into his ears .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 17]: `` I am interested , '' said his neighbor , `` because I knew poor Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 10]: He hunted regularly with the York and Ainsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 4]: `` Saumarez ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 4]: murmured Colonel Grant .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 10]: `` I once met a man of that name .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 9]: He was shot on the Modder River . ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 8]: `` This girl may be his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 20]: The paper describes her mother as a lady of independent means , visiting the moors for her health . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 4]: `` Poor Saumarez !
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 30]: From what I remember of his character , the child must be a chip of the same block -- he was an irresponsible daredevil , a terror among women .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 6]: But he died gallantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 18]: `` There 's a lot about her in the local paper , which reached me this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 8]: Would you care to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 6]: `` Newspapers are so inaccurate .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 7]: They never know the facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 33]: Yet the colonel , not caring to play bridge , asked later for the loan of the journal named by his informant , and read therein the story of the village tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 25]: As fate willed it , the writer was the reporter of the _ Messenger _ , and his account was replete with local knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 16]: Yes , Mrs. Saumarez was the widow of Colonel Saumarez , late of the Hussars .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 6]: But -- what was this ?
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 29]: `` Martin Court Bolland , a bright-faced boy , of an intelligence far greater than one looks for in rustic youth , has himself a somewhat romantic history .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 14]: He is the adopted son of the sturdy yeoman whose name he bears .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 21]: Mr. and Mrs. Bolland were called to London thirteen years ago to attend the funeral of the farmer 's brother .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 17]: One evening while seeing the sights of the great metropolis they found themselves in Ludgate Hill .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 54]: They were passing the end of St. Martin 's Court , when a young woman named Martineau -- '' The colonel laid aside his cigar and twisted his body sideways , so that the light of the billiard-room lamps should fall clearly on the paper yet leave his face in the shade . ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 34]: -- a young woman named Martineau threw herself , with a baby in her arms , from the fourth story of a house in the court , and was killed by the fall .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 19]: The baby 's frock was caught by a projecting sign , and the child hung perilously in air .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 33]: John Bolland , whose strong , stern face reveals a character difficult to surprise , impossible to daunt , jumped forward and caught the tiny mite as it dropped a second time .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 32]: Mrs. Bolland still treasures a letter written by the infant 's unhappy mother , and prizes to the utmost the fine boy whom she and her husband adopted from that hour .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 26]: The old couple are childless , though with Martin calling them ` father ' and ` mother , ' they would scoff at the statement .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 42]: This , then , is the well-knit , fearless youngster who fought the squire 's son on that eventful night , and whose evidence is of the utmost importance in the police theory of crime , as opposed to accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 18]: Colonel Grant went steadily through the neat sentences on which the _ Messenger _ correspondent prided himself .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 42]: He was a man of bronze ; he showed no more emotion than a statue , though the facts staring from the printed page might well have produced external signs of the tempest which sprang into instant being in his soul .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 10]: He read each line of descriptive matter and report .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 18]: For the sorrows of Betsy , the final daring of George Pickering , he had no eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 84]: It was the boy he sought in the living record : the boy who fought young Beckett-Smythe to rescue the thoughtless child -- for so Ang√®le figured in the text ; the boy who repudiated with scorn the solicitor 's suggestion that he formed part and parcel of the crowd of urchins gathered in the hotel yard ; the farmer 's adopted son , who spoke so fearlessly and bore himself so well that the newspaper noted his intelligence , his bright looks .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 14]: At last Colonel Grant laid down the sheet and lighted a fresh cigar .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 22]: He smoked for a few minutes , watching the pool players , and declining an invitation to join in the game .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 25]: He seemed to be planning some line of action ; soon he went to the library and unrolled a large scale map of England .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 27]: He found Nottonby -- Elmsdale was too small a place to be denoted -- and , after consulting a railway timetable , wrote a long telegram .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 29]: These things accomplished , he seized an opportunity to tell Lord Heronsdale that business of the utmost importance would take him away by the first train next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 16]: Of course , his host was voluble in protestations , so the soldier explained matters .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 22]: `` You asked me to-day , '' he said , `` why I turned my back on town thirteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 10]: I meant telling you at a more convenient season .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 18]: Will it suffice now to say that a kindred reason tears me away from your moor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 10]: `` Gad , I hope there is nothing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 5]: Can I help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 8]: `` Yes ; by letting me go .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 7]: You will be here until October .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 5]: May I return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 13]: `` My dear Grant -- '' So they settled it that way .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 31]: About three o'clock on the second day after the colonel 's departure from Cairn-corrie he and an elderly man of unmistakably legal appearance walked from Elmsdale station to the village .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 34]: The station master , forewarned , had procured a dogcart from the `` Black Lion , '' but the visitors preferred dispatching their portmanteaux in the vehicle , and they followed on foot .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 58]: Thus it happened -- as odd things do happen in life -- that the two men met a boy walking rapidly from the village , and some trick of expression in his face caused the colonel to halt him with a question : `` Can you tell me where the ` Black Lion ' inn is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 13]: On the left , just beyond the bend in the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 8]: `` And the White House Farm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 10]: The village youth looked at the speaker with interest .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 14]: `` On the right , sir ; after you cross the green . ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 32]: The two men stood and stared at Martin , who was dressed in a neat blue serge suit , obtained by post from York , the wildcat having ruined its predecessor .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 55]: The older man , who reminded the boy of Mr. Stockwell , owing to the searching clearness of his gaze , said not a word ; but the tall , sparsely-built soldier continued -- for Martin civilly awaited his pleasure -- `` Is your name , by any chance , Martin Court Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 4]: The boy smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 10]: `` It is , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 28]: `` Are you -- can you -- that is , if you are not busy , you might show us the inn -- and the farm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 56]: The gentleman seemed to have a slight difficulty in speaking , and his eyes dwelt on Martin with a queer look in them : but the answer came instantly : `` I 'm sorry , sir ; but I am going to the vicarage to tea , and you can not possibly miss either place .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 35]: The inn has a signpost by the side of the road , and the White House stands by itself on a small bank about a hundred and fifty yards farther down the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 16]: The older gentleman broke in : `` That will be our best course , Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 10]: We can easily find our way -- alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 13]: The hint in the words was intended for the ears that understood .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 10]: Colonel Grant nodded , yet was loath to go .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 10]: `` Is the vicar a friend of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 5]: he said to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 7]: I like him very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 9]: `` Does a Mrs. Saumarez live here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 11]: She is at the vicarage now , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 18]: You might tell her you met a Colonel Grant , who knew her husband in South Africa .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 12]: You will not forget the name , eh -- Grant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 8]: `` Of course not , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 8]: Martin surveyed the stranger with redoubled attention .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 12]: A live colonel is a rare sight in a secluded village .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 16]: The man , seizing any pretext to prolong the conversation , drew out a pocketbook .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 10]: `` Here is my card , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 10]: `` You need not give it to Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 8]: She will probably recognize my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 7]: The boy glanced at the pasteboard .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 5]: It read : Lieut.-Col .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 9]: Reginald Grant , `` Indian Staff Corps . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 35]: Now , it chanced that among Martin 's most valued belongings was a certain monthly publication entitled `` Recent British Battles , '' and he had read that identical name in the July number .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 36]: As was his way , he remembered exactly the heroic deeds with which a gallant officer was credited , so he asked somewhat shyly : `` Are you Colonel Grant of Aliwal , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 32]: He pronounced the Indian word wrongly , with a short `` a '' instead of a long one , but never did misplaced accent convey sweeter sound to man 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 6]: The soldier was positively startled .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 18]: `` My dear boy , '' he cried , `` how can you possibly know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 8]: `` Everyone knows your name , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 9]: No fear of me forgetting it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 27]: The honest admiration in those brown eyes was a new form of flattery ; for the first time in his life Colonel Grant hungered for more .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 15]: `` You have astonished me more than I can tell , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 10]: `` What have you read of the Aliwal campaign ?
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 5]: All right , Dobson .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 7]: We are in no hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 12]: This to his companion , who ventured on a mild remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 41]: `` I have a book , sir , which tells you all about Aliwal '' -- this time Martin pronounced the word correctly ; no wonder the newspaper commented on his intelligence -- `` and it has pictures , too .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 20]: There is a grand picture of you , riding through the gate of the fort , sword in hand .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 19]: Do you mind me saying , sir , that I am very pleased to have met you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 6]: The man averted his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 7]: He dared not look at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 11]: He made pretense to bite the end off a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 13]: He was compelled to do something to keep his lips from trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 16]: `` I hope we shall meet often again , Martin , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 18]: `` I 'll tell you more than the book does , though I have not read it .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 9]: Run off to your friends at the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 12]: He held out his hand , which the boy shook diffidently .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 18]: There was no doubt whatever in Martin 's mind that Colonel Grant was an extraordinarily nice gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 7]: `` My God , Dobson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 30]: cried the soldier , turning again to look after the alert figure of the boy ; `` I have seen him , spoken to him -- my own son !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 9]: I would know him among a million . ''
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 22]: `` He certainly bears a marked resemblance to your own photograph at the same age , '' admitted the cautious solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 7]: `` And what a fine youngster !
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 17]: By Jove , did you twig the way he caught on to the pronunciation of Aliwal ?
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 4]: Bless that book !
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 24]: It shall be bound in the rarest leather , though I never rode through that gate -- I ran , for dear life !
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 28]: I -- I tell you what , Dobson , I 'd sooner do it now than face these people , the Bollands , and explain my errand .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 7]: I suppose they worship him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 13]: `` The position differs from my expectations , '' said the solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 12]: `` The boy does not talk like a farmer 's son .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 17]: And he is going to tea at the vicarage with a lady of good social position .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 15]: Can the Bollands be of higher grade than we are led to believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 8]: `` The newspaper is my only authority .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 11]: Ah , here is the ` Black Lion . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 14]: Mrs. Atkinson bustled forward to assure the gentlemen that she could accommodate them .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 12]: Colonel Grant was allotted the room in which George Pickering died !
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 8]: It was the best in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 17]: He glanced for a moment through the window and took in the scene of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 26]: `` That must be where the two young imps fought , '' he murmured , with a smile , as he looked into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 13]: as Heronsdale says , I 'd like to have seen the battle .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 19]: And my boy whipped the other chap , who was bigger and older , the paper said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 16]: Soon the two men were climbing the slight acclivity on which stood the White House .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 17]: The door stood hospitably open , as was ever the case about tea-time in fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 9]: In the front kitchen was Martha , alone .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 4]: The colonel advanced .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 8]: `` Is Mr. Bolland at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 7]: he asked , raising his hat .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 9]: `` Noa , sir ; he is n't .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 12]: But he 's on ' y i ' t ' cow-byre .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 13]: If it 's owt important -- '' He followed her meaning sufficiently .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 10]: `` Will you oblige me by sending for him ?
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 10]: And -- er -- is Mrs. Bolland here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 9]: `` I 'm Mrs. Bolland , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 8]: `` Oh , I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 10]: Of course , I did not know you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 10]: He thought he would find a much younger woman .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 51]: Martha , in the close-fitting sunbonnet , with its wide flaps , her sleeves rolled up , and her outer skirt pinned behind to keep it clear of the dirt during unceasing visits to dairy and hen-roosts , looked even older than she was , her real age being fifty-five .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 10]: `` Will you kindly be seated , gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 12]: She was sure they were county folk come about the stock .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 16]: Her husband 's growing reputation as a breeder of prize cattle brought such visitors occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 22]: She wondered why the taller stranger asked for her , but he said no more , taking a chair in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 9]: She dispatched a maid to summon the master .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 7]: `` Hev ye coom far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 4]: she asked bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 5]: Colonel Grant looked around .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 15]: His eyes were searching the roomy kitchen for tokens of its occupants ' ways .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 21]: `` We traveled from Darlington to Elmsdale , '' he said , `` and walked here from the station . ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 10]: `` My goodness , ye 'll be fair famished .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 5]: Hev summat te eat .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 47]: There 's plenty o ' tea an ' cakes ; an ' if ye 'd fancy some ham an ' eggs -- '' `` Pray do not trouble , Mrs. Bolland , '' said the colonel when he had grasped the full extent of the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 14]: `` We wish to have a brief talk with you and your husband .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 18]: Afterwards , if you ask us , we shall be most pleased to accept your hospitality . ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 18]: He spoke so genially , with such utter absence of affectation , that Martha rather liked him .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 14]: Yet , what could she have to do with the business in hand ?
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 13]: Anyhow , here came John , crossing the road with heavy strides .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 8]: The farmer paused just within the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 7]: His huge frame filled the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 24]: He wore spectacles for reading only , and his deep-sunken eyes rested steadily , first on Colonel Grant , then on the solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 14]: Then they went back to the colonel and did not leave him again .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 10]: `` Good day , gentlemen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 9]: `` What can I de√§ for ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 18]: The man who stormed forts on horseback -- in pictures -- quailed at the task before him .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 6]: He nodded to the solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 14]: `` Dobson , '' he said , `` you know all the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 8]: Oblige me by stating them fully . ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 19]: The solicitor , who seemed to expect this request , produced a bulky packet of papers and photographs .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 37]: He prefaced his explanation by giving his companion 's name and rank , and introduced himself as a member of the firm of Dobson , Son and Smith , Solicitors , of Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 29]: `` Fifteen years ago , '' he went on , `` Colonel Grant was a subaltern , a junior officer , in the Guards , stationed in London .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 20]: A slight accident one day outside a railway station led him to make the acquaintance of a young lady .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 34]: She was hurrying to catch a train , when she was knocked down by a frightened horse , and might have been injured seriously were it not for Lieutenant Grant 's prompt assistance .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 38]: He escorted her to her lodgings , and discovered that she was what is known in London as a daily governess -- in other words , a poor , well-educated woman striving to earn a respectable living .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 38]: The horse had trampled on her foot , and she required proper attention and rest ; a brief interview with her landlady enabled Mr. Grant to make the requisite arrangements , unknown to the young lady herself .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 13]: He called a week later and found that she was quite recovered .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 32]: She was a very beautiful girl , of a lively disposition , only twenty years of age , and working hard in her spare time to perfect herself as a musician .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 22]: She had no idea of the social rank of her new friend , or perhaps matters might have turned out differently .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 15]: As it was , they met frequently , became engaged , and were married .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 11]: I have here a copy of the marriage certificate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 23]: He selected a long , narrow strip of blue paper from the documents he had placed before him on the kitchen table .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 19]: He opened it and offered it to Bolland , as though he wished the farmer to examine it .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 5]: John did not move .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 9]: He was still looking intently at Colonel Grant .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 33]: Martha , all a-flutter , with an indefinite anxiety wrinkling the corners of her eyes , said quickly : `` What might t ' young leddy 's ne√§m be , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 4]: `` Margaret Ingram .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 21]: She was of a Gloucestershire family , but her parents were dead , and she had no near relatives . ''
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 22]: Martha cried , somewhat tartly : `` An ' what hez all this te de√§ wi ' us , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 6]: `` Let be , wife .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 5]: Bide i ' patience .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 11]: T ' gentleman will tell us , ne√§ doot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 9]: John 's voice was hard , almost dissonant .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 8]: The solicitor gave him a rapid glance .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 13]: That harsh tone boded ill for the smooth accomplishment of his mission .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 16]: Martha wondered why her husband gazed so fixedly at the other man who spoke not .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 12]: But she toyed nervously with her apron and held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 14]: Mr. Dobson resumed : `` The young couple could not start housekeeping openly .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 34]: Lieutenant Grant depended solely on the allowance made to him by his father , whose ideas of family pride were so extreme that such a marriage must unquestionably have led to a rupture .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 11]: Moreover , a campaign in northern India was then threatening .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 13]: It broke out exactly a year and two months after the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 43]: Mr. Grant 's regiment was ordered to the front , and when he sailed from Southampton he left his young wife and an infant , a boy , four months old , installed in a comfortable flat in Clarges Street , Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 17]: It is important that the exact position of family affairs at this moment should be realized .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 34]: General Grant , father of the young officer , had suffered from an apopletic stroke soon after his son 's marriage , and to acquaint him with it now meant risking his life .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 14]: Young Grant 's action was known to and approved by several trustworthy friends .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 28]: He and his wife were very happy , and Mrs. Grant was correspondingly depressed when the exigencies of the national service took her husband away from her .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 25]: The parting between the young couple was a bitter trial , rendered all the more heartrending by reason of the concealment they had practiced .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 38]: However , as matters had been allowed to drift thus far , no one will pretend that there was any special need to worry General Grant at the moment of his son 's departure for a campaign .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 11]: Lieutenant Grant hoped to return with a step in rank .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 13]: Then , whatever the consequences , there must be a full explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 17]: He had not a great deal of money , but sufficient for his wife 's needs .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 23]: He left her two hundred pounds in notes and gold , and his bankers were empowered to pay her fifty pounds monthly .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 32]: His own allowance from General Grant was seventy-five pounds a month , and it was with great difficulty that he maintained his position in such an expensive regiment as the Guards .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 18]: The campaign eased the pressure , or he could not have kept it up for long . ''
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 11]: `` Are all these details quite necessary , Dobson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 34]: said the colonel , for the steady glare of the farmer , the growing pallor of poor Martha , around whose heart an icy hand was taking sure grip , were exceedingly irksome .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 16]: `` They are if I am to do you justice , '' replied the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 5]: `` Never mind me .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 10]: Tell them of Margaret -- and the boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 23]: `` I will pass over the verification of my statement , '' went on Mr. Dobson , bending over the folded papers .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 5]: `` Seven months passed .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 11]: Mrs. Grant expected soon to be delivered of another child .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 7]: She heard regularly from her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 31]: His regiment was in the Khyber Pass , when one evening she was robbed of her small store of jewelry and a considerable sum of money by a trusted servant .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 24]: The theft was reported in the papers , and General Grant read of his son 's wife being a resident in Clarges Street .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 40]: He went to the flat next day , saw the poor girl , behaved in a way that can only be ascribed to the folly of an old man broken by disease , and cut off supplies at once .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 21]: Within a week Mrs. Grant found herself in poverty , and her husband at least a month 's post distant .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 7]: She did not lose her wits .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 19]: She sold her furniture and raised money enough to support herself and her baby boy for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 33]: Of course , she was very much distressed , as General Grant wrote to her , called her an adventuress , and stated that he had disinherited his son on her account .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 6]: This was only partly true .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 25]: He tore up one will , but made no other , and forgot that there was a second copy in possession of my firm .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 8]: Mrs. Grant then did a foolish thing .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 16]: She concealed her troubles from her husband 's friends , who would have helped her .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 15]: She took cheap lodgings in another part of London , and changed her name .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 25]: This seems to be accounted for by the fact that General Grant , in his insane suspicions , set private detectives to watch her .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 15]: Moreover , the bankers wrote her a curt letter which added to her miseries .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 21]: She rented rooms in St. Martin 's Court , Ludgate Hill , and gave her name as Mrs. Martineau . ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 32]: Martha sprang at the solicitor with an eerie screech : `` Hev ye coom to steal oor bairn , the bonny lad we 've reared i ' infancy an ' childhood ?
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 4]: Leave this house !
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 13]: John -- husband -- will ye let 'em drive me mad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 7]: John took her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 34]: `` Martha , '' he said , with a break in his voice that shook his hearers and stilled his wife 's cries ; `` dinnat mak ' oor burthen harder te bear .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 16]: A man 's heart deviseth his way , but the Lord directeth his steps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 16]: Servants , men and women , came running at their mistress 's scream of terror .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 10]: They stood , abashed , in the kitchen passage .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: None paid heed to them .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 15]: Colonel Grant rose and approached the trembling woman cowering at her husband 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 20]: Her old eyes were streaming now ; she gazed at him with the pitiful anguish of a stricken animal .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 11]: He took her wrinkled hand and bent low before her .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 22]: `` Madam , '' he said , `` God forbid that my son should lose his mother a second time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 7]: He could say no other word .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 22]: Even in her agony , Martha felt hot tears falling on her bare arm , and they were not her own .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 17]: `` Eh , but it 's a sad errand ye 're on , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 6]: `` Wife , wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 18]: cried John huskily , `` if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 7]: Colonel Grant is a true man .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 6]: It 's in his fe√§ce .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 23]: He we√§n ' t rive Martin frae yer arms , an ' no man can tak ' him frae yer heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 6]: Colonel Grant drew himself up .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 6]: He caught Bolland 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 9]: `` Bear with me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 6]: `` I have suffered much .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 11]: I lost my wife and two children , one unborn .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 12]: They were torn from me as though by a destroying tempest .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 12]: One is given back , after thirteen long years of mourning .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 12]: Can you not spare me a place in his affections ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 9]: `` Ay , ay , '' growled John .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 28]: `` We 're nobbut owd folk at t ' best , an ' t ' lad was leavin ' oor roof for school in a little while .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 20]: We can sattle things like sensible people , if on ' y Martha here will gie ower greetin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 10]: It troubles me sair to hear her lamentin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 16]: We 've had no sike deed i ' thirty-fower years o ' married life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 15]: The man was covering his own distress by solicitude in his wife 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 4]: She knew it .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 28]: She wiped her eyes defiantly with her apron and made pretense to smile , though she had received a shock she would remember to her dying day .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 9]: Some outlet was necessary for her surcharged feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 24]: She whisked around on the crowd of amazed domestics , dairymaids and farmhands , pressing on each other 's heels in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 9]: `` What are ye gapin ' at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 4]: she cried shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 7]: `` Is there nowt te de√§ ?
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 27]: If tea 's overed , git on wi ' yer work , an ' be sharp aboot it , or I 'll side ye quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 8]: The stampede that followed relieved the situation .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 9]: The servants faded away under her fiery glance .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 4]: Colonel Grant smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 21]: `` I am glad to see , '' he said , `` that you maintain discipline in your regiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 14]: `` They 're all ears an ' ne√§ brains , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 17]: `` My , but I 'm that upset I hardly ken what I 'm sayin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 9]: Mebbe ye 'll finish yer tale , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 41]: I 'm grieved I med sike a dash at ye , but I could n't bide -- '' `` There , there , '' said John , with his gruff soothing , `` sit ye doon an ' listen quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 16]: I guessed their business t ' first minnit I set eyes on t ' colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 8]: Why , Martha , look at him .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 10]: He hez Martin 's eyes and Martin 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 20]: Noo , ye 'd hev dark-brown hair , I reckon , when ye were a lad , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 19]: For answer , Colonel Grant stooped to the lawyer 's papers and took from them a framed miniature .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 20]: `` That is my portrait at the age of twelve , '' he said , placing it before them .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 9]: `` Eh , but that caps owt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 3]: cried Martha .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 6]: `` It 's Martin hissel !
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 44]: Oh , my honey , how little did I think what was coomin ' when I set yer shirt an ' collar ready , an ' med ye tidy te gan te tea wi ' t ' fine folk at t ' vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 15]: An ' noo ye 're a better bred ` un than ony of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 5]: The Lord love ye !
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 9]: Here ye are , smilin ' at me .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 34]: They may mak ' ye a colonel or a gin ` ral , for owt I care : ye 'll nivver forgit yer poor old muther , will ye , my bairn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 13]: She kissed the miniature as if it were Martin 's own presentment .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 10]: The men left her to sob again in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 34]: Soon she calmed herself sufficiently to ask : `` But why i ' t ' wulld did that poor lass throw herself an ' her little ` un inte t ' street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 22]: Mr. Dobson took up his story once more : `` She explained her action in a pathetic letter to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 9]: She was ill , lonely , and poverty-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 16]: She brooded for days on General Grant 's cruel words and still more cruel letter .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 17]: They led her to believe that she was the unwitting cause of her husband 's ruin .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 17]: She resolved to free him absolutely and at the same time preserve his name from notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 25]: Therefore she wrote him a full account of her change of name , and told him that her children would die with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 10]: `` That was a mad thing te de√§ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 30]: The doctor who knew her best told her husband six months later that Mrs. Grant was , in his opinion , suffering from an unrecognized attack of puerperal fever .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 19]: It was latent in her system , and developed with the trouble so suddenly brought upon her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 21]: `` Yon was a wicked owd man -- '' `` The general was called to account by a higher power .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 11]: Mrs. Grant wrote him also a statement of her intentions .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 17]: Next morning he read of her death , and a second attack of apoplexy proved fatal .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 17]: Her letter did not reach her husband until after a battle in which he was wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 21]: He cabled to us , and we made every inquiry , but it was remarkable how chance baffled our efforts .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 36]: In the first instance , the policeman whom you encountered in Ludgate Hill and who knew you had adopted the child , had left the force and emigrated , owing to some unfortunate love affair .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 23]: In the second , several newspapers reported the child as dead , though the records of the inquest soon corrected that error .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 28]: Thirdly , someone named Bolland died in the hotel where you stayed and was buried at Highgate -- '' `` My brother , '' put in John .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 7]: `` Yes ; we know now .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 22]: But conceive the barrier thus placed in our path when the dates of the two events were compared long afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 5]: The farmer looked puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 30]: The solicitor went on : `` Of course , you wonder why there should have been any delay , but the Coroner 's notes were lost in a fire .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 10]: Nevertheless , we advertised in dozens of newspapers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 14]: `` We hardly ever see a paper , sir , '' said Martha .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 19]: `` Yet , the wonder is that some of your friends did not see it and tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 19]: Finally , a sharp-witted clerk of ours solved the Highgate Cemetery mystery , and the advertisements were repeated .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 46]: Colonel Grant was back in India by that time trying hard to leave his bones there , by all accounts , and perhaps we did not spend as much money on this second quest as if he were at home to authorize the expenditure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 19]: `` When was that , sir -- t ' second lot o ' advertisements , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 3]: asked John .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 11]: `` Quite a year after Mrs. Grant 's death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 6]: Bolland stroked his chin thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 23]: `` I remember , '' he said , `` a man at Malton fair sayin ' summat aboot an inquiry for me .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 32]: But yan o ' t ' hands rode twenty miles across counthry te tell me that Martin had gotten t ' measles , an ' I kem yam that neet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 18]: `` Naturally , I can give you every proof of my statements , '' said Mr. Dobson .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 29]: `` They are all here -- '' `` Mebbe ye 'll know this writin ' , '' interrupted Martha , laying down the miniature for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 29]: She unlocked a drawer , took out a small tin box , and from its depths produced , among other articles , a crumbling sheet of note paper .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 12]: On it was written : `` My name is not Martineau .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 8]: I have killed myself and my boy .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 18]: If he dies with his unhappy mother he will never know the miseries of this life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 13]: It was unsigned , undated , a hurried scrawl in faded ink .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 19]: `` Margaret 's handwriting , '' said Colonel Grant , looking at the pathetic message with sorrow-laden eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 21]: `` It was found on t ' poor leddy 's dressin ' - table , fastened wi ' a hatpin .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 17]: An ' these are t ' clothes Martin wore when he fell into John 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 35]: Nay , sir , '' she added , as Colonel Grant began examining the little frock , `` she took good care , poor thing , that ne√§body should find oot whe√§ she was .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 8]: Ivvery mark hez bin picked off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 45]: `` Martin is his feyther 's son , or I ken nowt aboot stock , '' cried John Bolland , making a fine effort to dispel the depression which again possessed the little gathering at sight of these mournful mementoes of the dead past .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 14]: `` Coom , gentlemen , sit ye doon an ' hev some tea .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 15]: Ye 'll not be for takkin ' Martin away by t ' next train .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 11]: Martha , what 's t ' matter wi ' ye ?
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 26]: I 've nivver known folk be so lang i ' t ' hoose afore an ' not be asked if they had a mooth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 17]: `` Ye 're on t ' wrang gait this time , John , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 9]: `` I axed 'em afore ye kem in .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 18]: By this time , sure-ly , ye 'll be wantin ' soom ham an ' eggs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 6]: she added to the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 12]: I believe I could eat some , '' laughed the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 5]: Martha smiled once more .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 6]: She liked Martin 's father .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 9]: Each moment the first favorable impression was deepening .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 31]: She was on the point of bustling away to the back kitchen , when they all heard the patter of feet , in desperate haste , approaching the front door .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 5]: Elsie Herbert dashed in .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 4]: She was hatless .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 16]: Her long brown hair was floating in confusion over her shoulders and down her back .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 11]: She was crying in great gulps and gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 7]: `` Oh , Mr. Bolland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 6]: `` Oh , Mrs. Bolland !
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 6]: -- what shall I say ?
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 4]: Martin is hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 6]: He fell off the swing .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 4]: Ang√®le did it !
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 5]: I 'll kill her !
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 9]: I 'll tear her face with my hands !
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 10]: Oh , come , someone , and help father .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 10]: He is trying to bring back Martin 's senses .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 8]: -- it was all on my account .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 5]: Oh , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 8]: And she sank fainting to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 17]: CHAPTER XVIII THE SEVEN FULL YEARS But Martin was not dead , nor even seriously injured .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 26]: At first , the affair looked so ugly -- its main features were so incomprehensible -- that Mr. Herbert was startled into somewhat panic-stricken action .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 37]: Here was Martin lying unconscious on the ground , with Elsie kneeling by his side , passionately beseeching him in one breath to speak to her , and in the next accusing Ang√®le Saumarez of murder .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 23]: The vicar was not blameworthy , in that he failed to grasp either the nature of the accusation or its seeming unreasonableness .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 42]: The single rope of the gymnastic swing erected in the garden for Elsie 's benefit had been cut deliberately with a sharp knife a few inches above the small bar on which the user 's weight was supported by both hands .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 11]: Of the cutting there could be no manner of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 37]: The jagged edges of the few strands left by a devilish ingenuity -- so that the swing must need be in violent motion before the rope snapped -- were clearly visible at the point of severance .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 15]: But who had done this thing , and with what deadly object in view ?
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 45]: And why did Elsie pitch on Ang√®le Saumarez so readily , glaring at her with such eyes of vengeance that the vicar was constrained to order , with the utmost sternness of which he was capable , that the torrent of words should cease .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 26]: Indeed , he dispatched her to acquaint the Bollands with tidings of the disaster as a haphazard pretext to get her out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 15]: Apart from sensing the accident 's inexplicable motive , its history was simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 43]: Before tea was served , Martin and Elsie were using the swing alternately , vying with each other in the effort to touch with their toes the leaves of a tree nearly twenty feet distant from the vertical line of the rope .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 31]: Ang√®le , of course , took no part in this contest ; she contented herself with a sarcastic incredulity when Elsie vowed that she had accomplished the feat twice already .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 23]: Martin , stronger , but less skilled in the trick of the swing than the girl , strove hard to excel her .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 15]: Yet he , too , fell short by a few inches time after time .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 35]: At last , Elsie vowed that when she was rested after tea she would prove her words , and threw a pebble at the branch which she claimed to have reached a week ago .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 19]: Neither Mrs. Saumarez nor the vicar attached any weight to the somewhat emphatic argument between the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 10]: It was a splendid contest between Martin and Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 8]: It interested the elders for conflicting reasons .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 58]: To see the graceful girl propelling herself through the air in a curve of nearly forty feet at each pendulum stroke of the swing was a pleasing sight to her father , but it caused Mrs. Saumarez to regret again that her daughter had not been taught to think more of athletic exercises and less of dress .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 31]: While the young people were following their seniors to the drawing-room , Ang√®le said to Elsie : `` I think I could do that myself with a little practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 31]: `` You are not tall enough , '' was the uncompromising answer , for Elsie 's temper was ruffled by the simpering unbelief with which the other treated her assurances .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 21]: `` Not so tall , no ; but I can bend back like this , and you can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 23]: Without a second 's hesitation Ang√®le twisted her head and shoulders around until her chin was in a line with her heels .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 22]: Then she dropped lightly so that her hands rested on the grass of the lawn , straightening herself with equal ease .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 18]: The contortion was performed so quickly that neither Mr. Herbert nor Mrs. Saumarez was aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 26]: It was a display not suited to the conditions of ordinary costume , and it necessarily exhibited portions of the attire not usually in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 15]: Martin had eyes only for the girl 's acrobatic agility , but Elsie blushed .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 11]: `` I do n't like that , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 18]: `` I can stand on my head and walk on my hands , '' cried Ang√®le instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 11]: `` Martin , some day I 'll show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 21]: Conscious though she was that these things were said to annoy her , Elsie remembered that Ang√®le was a guest .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 7]: `` How did you learn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 8]: `` Were you taught in school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 3]: `` School !
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 2]: Me !
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 7]: I have never been to school .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 9]: Education is the curse of children 's lives .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 5]: I never leave mamma .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 15]: One day in Nice I saw a circus girl doing tricks of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 7]: I practiced in my bedroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 8]: `` Does your mother wish that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 7]: `` She does n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 29]: `` I wonder you have n't broken your neck , '' said the practical Martin , who felt his bones creaking at the mere notion of such twisting .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 3]: Ang√®le laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 14]: `` It is quite easy , when you are slim and elegant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 6]: Her vanity amused the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 17]: `` You speak as though Elsie were as stiff as a board , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 29]: `` If you had watched her carefully , Ang√®le , you would have seen that she is quite as supple as you , only in a different way .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 7]: And she is strong , too .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 25]: I dare say she could swing with one hand and carry you in the other , if she had a mind to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 12]: This ready advocacy of a new-found divinity angered Ang√®le beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 43]: Possibly she meant no greater harm than the disconcerting of a rival ; but she slipped out of the room when Mr. Herbert sent Elsie to the library to bring a portfolio of old prints which he wished to show Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 25]: Although it was never definitely proved against Ang√®le , someone tampered with the rope before a move was made to the garden after tea .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 16]: The cause , the effect , were equally clear ; the human agent remained unknown .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 23]: `` Now , I 'll prove my words , '' cried Elsie , darting across the lawn in front of the others .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 14]: `` Here , it 's my turn , '' shouted the boy gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 7]: `` I 'll race you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 3]: `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 5]: I want you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 7]: shrieked Ang√®le , running after him .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 8]: He paid no heed to her cries .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 31]: Outstripping both girls in the race , he sprang at the swing , and was carried almost to the debated limit of the tree by the impetus of the rush .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 32]: When he felt himself stopping he threw up his feet in a wild effort to touch the leaves so tantalizingly out of reach , and in that instant the rope broke .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 18]: He turned completely over and fell with a heavy thud on the back of his bent head .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 31]: The screaming of the girls brought the vicar from his prints in great alarm , and his agitation increased when he discovered that the boy could neither move nor speak .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 13]: Elsie was halfway to the White House before Martin regained his breath .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 14]: Once vitality returned , however , he was quickly on his feet again .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 5]: `` What happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 8]: he asked , craning his head awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 9]: `` I thought someone fired a gun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 15]: `` You frightened us nearly out of our wits , '' cried the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 14]: `` And I was stupid enough to send Elsie flying to your people .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 11]: Goodness knows what she will have said to them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 13]: Promptly the boy shook himself and tried to break into a run .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 11]: `` I must -- follow her , '' he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 17]: But not yet was the masterful spirit able to control relaxed muscles ; he collapsed again .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 29]: Mrs. Saumarez cried aloud in a new fear , but the vicar , accustomed to the minor accidents of the cricket field and gymnasium , was cooler now .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 23]: `` He 's all right -- only needs a drink of water and a few minutes ' rest , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 43]: He bade one of the maids go as quickly as possible to the Bollands ' farm and say that the mischief to Martin was a mere nothing , and then busied himself in more scientific fashion with restoring his patient 's animation .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 22]: Unfastening the boy 's collar and the neckband of his shirt , Mr. Herbert satisfied himself that the clavicle was uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 16]: There was a slight abrasion of the scalp , which was sore to the touch .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 20]: In a minute , or less , Martin was again protesting that there was little the matter with him .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 25]: He would not be satisfied until the vicar allowed him to start once more for the village , though at a more sedate pace .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 22]: Then Mrs. Saumarez , in a voice of deep distress , asked Mr. Herbert if the rope had really been cut .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 14]: `` You can see yourself that there is no doubt about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 12]: `` But your daughter charged Ang√®le with this -- this crime .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 5]: My child denies it .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 13]: She has no knife or implement of any sort in her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 12]: I assure you I have satisfied myself on that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 10]: `` The affair is a mystery , Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 6]: It must be cleared up .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 6]: Thank God , Martin escaped !
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 11]: He might be lying here dead at this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 11]: `` Are you sure it was not an accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 7]: `` What am I to say ?
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 24]: Here is a stout hempen cord with nearly all its strands severed as if with a razor , and the other torn asunder .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 26]: And , from what I can gather , it was Elsie , and not Martin , for whose benefit this diabolical outrage was planned . ''
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 19]: The vicar spoke warmly , but the significance of the incident was dawning slowly on his perplexed mind .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 20]: Providence alone had ordained that neither the boy nor the girl had been gravely , perhaps fatally , injured .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 5]: Mrs. Saumarez was haggard .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 10]: She seemed to have aged in those few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 4]: `` Ang√®le ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 11]: The girl , who was sobbing , came to her .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 20]: `` Can it be possible , '' said the distracted mother , `` that you interfered with the swing ?
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 10]: Why did you leave the drawing-room during tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 11]: `` I only went to stroke a cat , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 8]: Indeed , I never touched the swing .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 11]: And I could not cut it with my fingers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 26]: `` On second thoughts , '' said the vicar coldly , `` I think that the matter may be allowed to rest where it is .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 26]: Of course , one of my servants may be the culprit , or a mischievous village youth who had been watching the children at play .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 16]: But the two girls do not seem to get on well together , Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 11]: I fear they are endowed with widely different temperaments . ''
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 7]: The hint could not be ignored .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 5]: The lady smiled bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 18]: `` It is well that I should have decided already to leave Elmsdale , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 17]: `` It is a charming place , but my visit has not been altogether fortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 10]: Mr. Herbert remembered the curious phrase in after years .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 5]: He understood it then .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 16]: At the moment he was candidly relieved when Mrs. Saumarez and Ang√®le took their departure .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 21]: He jammed on a hat and hastened to the White House to learn what sort of sensation Elsie had created .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 8]: A week later he made a discovery .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 36]: He had a curious hobby -- he was his own bootmaker , and Elsie 's , having taught himself to be a craftsman in an art which might well claim higher rank than it holds .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 16]: When next he rummaged among his implements for a shoemaker 's knife it was missing .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 24]: It was found in the garden next spring , jammed to the top of the hilt into the soft mold beneath a rhododendron .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 24]: The tools were kept on a bench in the conservatory ; so Ang√®le might have accomplished her impish desire in a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 60]: On reaching the White House he was mildly surprised at finding Martin propped against the knee of a tall , soldierly stranger , who was consoling the boy with a reminiscence of a far worse toss at polo , by which a hard _ sola topi _ was flattened on the iron surface of an Indian _ maidan _ .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 15]: Elsie , white , but much interested , was sipping a glass of milk .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 30]: `` Eh , Vicar , '' cried Mrs. Bolland , in whose face Mr. Herbert saw signs of recent excitement , `` your lass gev us a rare start .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 27]: She landed here like a mad thing , screamed oot that Martin was dead , an ' dropped te t ' flure half dead herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 9]: `` The fault was mine , Mrs. Bolland .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 5]: There was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: At first I thought Martin was badly hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 13]: I am , indeed , very sorry if Elsie alarmed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 21]: His words were meant to reassure the others , but his eyes were fixed on the girl 's pallid face .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 8]: John Bolland laughed in his dry way .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 10]: `` Nay , Passon , dinnat fret aboot Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 11]: She 's none t ' warse for a sudden stop .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 4]: She was ower-excited .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 11]: Where 's yon lass o ' Mrs. Saumarez 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 7]: `` Gone home with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 8]: I hear they are leaving Elmsdale . ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 6]: `` A good riddance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 4]: said John heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 5]: He turned to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 11]: `` Ye 'll be winded again , I reckon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 15]: `` Well , I left my ash stick i ' t ' low yard .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 12]: Mebbe you an ' t ' young leddy will fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 8]: There 's noa need te hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 17]: This was an oblique instruction to the boy to make himself scarce for half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 10]: With Elsie as a companion he needed no urging .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 8]: They set off , happy as grigs .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 31]: `` Noo , afore ye start te fill t ' vicar wi ' wunnerment , '' cried Martha , `` I want te ax t ' colonel a question . ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 9]: `` What is it , Mrs. Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 11]: Colonel Grant was smiling at the vicar 's puzzled air .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 9]: These good people knew naught of formal introductions .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 9]: `` How old is t ' lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 14]: `` He was fourteen years old on the sixth of last June . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 9]: `` Eh , but that 's grand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 6]: She clapped her hands delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 10]: `` I guessed him tiv a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 21]: We reckoned his birthday as a twel ` month afore we found him , and that was June the eighteenth .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 8]: And what 's his right ne√§m ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 13]: `` He was christened after me and after his mother 's family .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 8]: His name is Reginald Ingram Grant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 14]: `` May I ask who in the world you are talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 5]: interposed the perplexed vicar .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 3]: `` Whe√§ ?
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 6]: Why , oor Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 3]: cried Martha .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 12]: `` He 's a gentleman born , God bless him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 23]: `` And , what is much more important , Mrs. Bolland , he is a gentleman bred , '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 31]: * * * * * The scene in the kitchen of the White House had been too dramatic that some hint of it should not reach the village that night .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 44]: Soon all Elmsdale knew that the mystery of Martin 's parentage had been solved , and great was the awe of the boy 's playmates when they heard that his father was a `` real live colonel i ' t ' army . ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 28]: A garbled version of the story came to Mr. Beckett-Smythe 's ears , and he called on Colonel Grant at the `` Black Lion '' next day .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 20]: He arrived in state , in a new Mercedes car , handled by a chauffeur replica of Fritz Bauer .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 29]: Beckett-Smythe had hardly mastered his surprise at the colonel 's confirmation of that which he had regarded as `` an incredible yarn '' when Mrs. Saumarez drove up .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 28]: She , too , recalling the message brought by Martin from her husband 's comrade-in-arms , came to verify the strange tale told by the Misses Walker .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 34]: Ang√®le accompanied her , and the girl 's eyes shot lightning at Martin , who was on the point of guiding his father to the moor when Mr. Beckett-Smythe put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 42]: The lawyer had departed for London by the morning train ; the three older people and the two youngsters gathered in the room thus set at liberty , Mrs. Atkinson having remodeled it into a sitting-room for the colonel 's use .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 7]: Mrs. Saumarez hailed the stranger effusively .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 17]: `` It is delightful to run across anyone who knew my husband , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 16]: `` In this remote part of Yorkshire none seems to have ever heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 21]: Believe me , Colonel Grant , it is positively a relief to meet a man who recognizes my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 27]: She may have intended this for an oblique thrust at Beckett-Smythe , relations between the Hall and The Elms having been somewhat strained since the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 22]: The Squire , a good fellow , who had no inkling of Ang√®le 's latest escapade , hastened to make amends .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 16]: `` You two must want to chat over old times , '' he said breezily .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 10]: `` Why not come and dine with me to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 11]: I have only one other guest -- an Admiralty man .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 18]: He 's prowling about the coast trying to select a suitable site for a wireless station . ''
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 18]: Now , Mrs. Saumarez would have declined the invitation had Beckett-Smythe stopped short at the first sentence .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 8]: As it was , she accepted instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 11]: `` Do come , Colonel Grant , '' she urged .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 34]: `` What between the Navy and the Intelligence Department it should be an interesting evening ... Oh , do n't look so surprised , '' she went on , with an engaging smile .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 13]: `` I still read the _ Gazette _ , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 8]: `` And what of the kiddies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 3]: said Beckett-Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 6]: `` They know my boys .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 9]: Your chauffeur can bring them home at nine .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 17]: By the way , the meal will be quite informal -- come as you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 9]: `` What do you say , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 4]: said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 20]: `` I shall be very pleased , sir ; but may I -- ask -- my mother first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 4]: The boy reddened .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 42]: His new place in the world was only twenty-four hours old , and his ideas were not yet adjusted to an order of things so astounding that he thought every minute he would wake up and find he had been dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 15]: `` Oh , certainly , '' and a kindly hand fell on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 9]: `` I am glad you spoke of it .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 16]: Mrs. Bolland is worthy of all the respect due to the best of mothers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 14]: `` I 'll go with you , Martin , '' announced Ang√®le suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 3]: Martin hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 36]: He was doubtful of the reception Mrs. Bolland might give the minx who had nearly caused him to break his neck , and , for his own part , he wanted to avoid Ang√®le altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 6]: She was a disturbing influence .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 10]: He feared her not at all as a spitfire .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 31]: It was when she displayed her most engaging qualities that she was really dangerous , and he knew from experience that her mood had changed within the past five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 14]: On alighting from the car she would like to have scratched his face .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 21]: Now he would not be surprised if she elected to walk with him hand in hand through the village street .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 7]: His father came to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 14]: `` Let us all go and see Mrs. Bolland , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 9]: `` It is only a few yards . ''
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 7]: They went out into the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 8]: Then Beckett-Smythe was struck by an afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 28]: `` If you 'll excuse me , I 'll run along to the vicarage and ask Herbert and his daughter to join us , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 6]: Mrs. Saumarez bit her lip .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 18]: `` I think I 'll leave Ang√®le at home , '' she said in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 6]: `` The child is delicate .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 18]: During the past week I have insisted that she goes to bed at eight every evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 35]: Colonel Grant understood why the lady did not want the two girls to meet , but it was borne in on him that she herself was determined not to miss that impromptu dinner party .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 12]: In a vague way he wondered what her motive could be .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 14]: `` Ah , that 's a pity , '' he heard Beckett-Smythe say .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 15]: `` She can be well wrapped up , and the weather is mild . ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 9]: He moved a little ahead of the two .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 19]: Martin , determined not to be left alone with Ang√®le , hastened to greet his friend , Fritz .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 8]: The two chauffeurs were conversing in German .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 12]: Apparently , they were examining the engine of the new car .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 14]: `` Martin , '' murmured Ang√®le , `` do n't bother about Fritz .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 7]: He 'll snap your head off .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 13]: He 's furious because he lost a map the other day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 5]: But Martin pressed on .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 22]: No longer could Ang√®le deceive him -- `` twiddle him around her little finger , '' as she would put it .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 6]: `` Hello , Fritz ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 7]: `` What map did you lose ?
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 9]: Not the one I marked for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 3]: Fritz turned .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 10]: The new chauffeur closed the bonnet of the engine .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 15]: `` No , '' he said , speaking slowly , and looking at Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 8]: `` It was a small road map .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 10]: You haf not seen it , I dink . ''
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 13]: `` Was it made of linen , with a red cover ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 13]: `` Yez , '' and the man 's face became curiously stern .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 25]: `` Oh , I saw you studying it one day at The Elms , but you did n't have it on the moor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 10]: Fritz 's scowl changed to an expression of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 32]: `` I haf mislaid it , '' he grunted , and again his glance dwelt on Ang√®le , who met his gaze with a bland indifference that seemed to gall him .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 5]: Colonel Grant drew near .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 9]: He had been eyeing the two spick-and-span chauffeurs .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 9]: `` Who is your friend , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 15]: He was interested in everything the boy did and in everyone whom he knew .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 26]: `` Oh , this is Fritz Bauer , Mrs. Saumarez 's chauffeur ... Fritz , this is Colonel Grant , of the Indian Army . ''
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 20]: Instantly the two young Germans straightened as though some mechanism had stiffened their spines and thrown back their heads .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 15]: The newcomer 's heels clicked and his right hand was raised in a salute .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 33]: Fritz , better schooled than his comrade by longer residence in England , barely prevented his heels from clicking , and managed to convert the salute into a raising of his cap .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 29]: There could be no doubt that he was flustered , because he said not a word , and the open-air tan of his cheeks assumed a deeper tint .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 24]: Apparently , Colonel Grant saw nothing of this , or , if he noticed the man 's confusion , attributed it to nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 10]: `` Two Mercedes cars in one small village ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 4]: he exclaimed laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 12]: `` You Germans are certainly conquering England by peaceful penetration . ''
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 39]: Mrs. Saumarez elected , after all , not to visit the White House that afternoon , so Ang√®le , having said good-by to the colonel and Martin in her prettiest manner , was whisked off in the car .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 19]: `` By the way , Martin , '' said his father as the two walked to the farm .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 8]: `` Mrs. Saumarez is German by birth .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 10]: Have you ever heard anything about her family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 6]: Martin had a good memory .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 13]: `` She is a baroness -- the Baroness Irma von Edelstein . ''
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 9]: The colonel was surprised at this glib answer .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 6]: `` Who told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 5]: `` Ang√®le , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 12]: But Mrs. Saumarez did not wish people to use her title .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 11]: She was vexed with Ang√®le for even mentioning it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 16]: Mrs. Saumarez sent her car to bring Colonel Grant and his son to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 28]: She was slightly ruffled when Fritz told her that they had gone already , Mr. Beckett-Smythe having collected his guests from both the inn and the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 27]: She might have been positively indignant if she had overheard Grant 's comments to the Admiralty official while the two strolled on the lawn before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 20]: `` A couple of Prussian officers , if ever I saw the genuine article , '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 9]: `` Real junkers -- smart-looking fellows , too .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 30]: Mrs. Saumarez is the widow of a British officer -- a fine chap , but poor as a church mouse -- and she belongs to a wealthy German family .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 4]: _ Verbum sap .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 11]: _ '' `` Nuff said , '' grinned the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 8]: `` But what is one to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 43]: No sooner is this outfit erected but it 'll be added to the display of local picture postcards , and the next German bigwig who visits this part of the country will be invited to amuse himself by ringing up Bremen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 24]: At any rate , Mrs. Saumarez was told that night that the Yorkshire coast was too highly magnetized to suit a wireless station .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 14]: The sailor thought an inland town like York would provide an ideal site .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 31]: `` You see , '' he explained politely , `` when the German High Seas Fleet defeats the British Navy it can shell our coast towns all to smithereens . ''
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 3]: She smiled .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 19]: `` You fighting men invariably talk of war with Germany as an assured thing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 22]: `` Yet I , who know Germany , and have relatives there , am convinced that the notion is absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 25]: `` The Emperor has been twenty years on the throne and has never drawn sword except on parade , '' put in the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 43]: `` There may have been danger once or twice in his hot youth , but he has grown to like England , and I can not conceive him plunging a great and thriving country into the morass of a doubtful campaign . ''
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 18]: `` Ninety-nine per cent of Englishmen like to think that way , '' said the Admiralty man .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 19]: `` In a multitude of counselors there is wisdom , so let 's hope they 're right . ''
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 20]: When the young folk got together on the terrace , Frank Beckett-Smythe asked Martin why his neck was stiff .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 17]: `` I took a toss off Elsie 's swing yesterday , '' was the airy answer .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 23]: Not a word did he or Elsie say as to Ang√®le , and the Beckett-Smythes knew better than to introduce her name .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 14]: * * * * * Mrs. Saumarez left for the South rather hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 6]: She paid no farewell visits .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 14]: She and Ang√®le traveled in the car ; Fran√ßoise followed with the baggage .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 26]: The Misses Walker were consoled for the loss of a valued lodger by receiving a less exacting one in the person of Martin 's father .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 26]: The boy himself , when his mental poise was adjusted to the phenomenal change in his life , soon grew accustomed to a new environment .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 43]: Mr. Herbert undertook to direct his studies in preparation for a public school , and Martha Bolland became reconciled gradually to seeing him once or twice daily , instead of all day , for he , too , lived at The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 27]: Officially , as it were , he adopted his new name , but to the small world of Elmsdale he would ever be `` Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 8]: Even his father fell into the habit .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 20]: The colonel drove him to the adjourned petty sessions at Nottonby when Betsy 's case came on for hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 27]: Mr. Stockwell abandoned his critical attitude and concurred with the police that there was no need to bring Ang√®le Saumarez from London to attend the trial .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 41]: Mrs. Saumarez gave no thought to the fact that the girl might be needed to give evidence , but the authorities decided that there were witnesses in plenty as to the outcry raised in the garden after Pickering was wounded .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 11]: It was November before Betsy appeared at the county assizes .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 19]: When she entered the dock , those who knew her were astonished by the improvement in her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 27]: It was probable that the enforced rest , the regular exercise , the judicious diet of the prison had exercised a beneficial effect on her health .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 37]: Her demeanor was calm as ever , and the able barrister who defended her did not scruple to suggest that it would create a better effect with the jury if she adopted a less unemotional attitude .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 5]: Her reply silenced him .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 23]: `` Do you think , '' she said , `` that I will be permitted to atone for my wrongdoing by punishment ?
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 10]: I live because my husband wished me to live .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 17]: I will be called to account , but not by an earthly judge or jury . ''
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 4]: She was right .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 44]: The assize judge held the scales of justice impartially between the sworn testimony of George Pickering and Betsy 's witnesses , on the one hand , and the evidence of Martin and the groom , backed by the scientists , on the other .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 31]: The jury gave her the benefit of the doubt and acquitted her , but it was noticed by many that his lordship contented himself with ordering her discharge from custody .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 8]: He passed no opinion on the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 24]: So Betsy was installed as mistress of Wetherby Lodge , the trustees having decided that she was well fitted to manage the estate .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 36]: Tongues wagged in Elmsdale when Mr. Stockwell drove thither one day and solemnly handed over to Martin the sword and the double-barreled gun , and to John Bolland the pedigree cow bequeathed by George Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 8]: The farmer eyed the animal grimly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 10]: 'T is an unfortunate beast , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 22]: `` Mebbe if I had n't sold her te poor George he might nivver hae coom te Elmsdale just then . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 12]: `` Do not think that , '' the solicitor assured him .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 10]: `` Pickering would most certainly have visited the fair .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 21]: I know , as a matter of fact , that he wished to purchase one of your brood mares . ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 5]: `` Ay , ay .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 5]: She went te Jarmany .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 17]: Well , if I 'm spared , I 'll send a good calf to Wetherby . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 10]: The lawyer and he shook hands on the compact .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 26]: Yet Pickering 's odd bequest was destined to work out in a way that would have amazed the donor , could he but know it .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 22]: Martin was at Winchester -- his father 's old school -- when he received a letter in Bolland 's laborious handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 23]: It read : `` MY DEAR LAD -- Yours to hand , and this leaves your mother and self in good health .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 21]: We were glad to hear that the box arrived all right and that your mates think well of Yorkshire cakes .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 25]: You may learn a lot of useful things at school , but you will not often meet with a better cook than your mother .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 16]: She is sore upset just now about a mishap we have had on the farm .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 14]: I turned out nearly all my shorthorns to graze on the low pastures .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 19]: The ground was a bit damp , and a strange cow broke in at night to join them .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 18]: I do n't rightly know what to blame , but next day they showed signs of rinderpest .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 38]: I sent for the vet , and they had to be slaughtered -- all but one two-year-old bull , Bainesse Boy IV. , and Mr. Pickering 's cow , which were not with them in the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 47]: It is a great loss , but I do n't repine , now that you are provided for , and it is not quite like starting all over again , as I have my land and my Cleveland bays , and I am in no debt .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 11]: In such matters I turn to the Lord for consolation .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 36]: I have just read this verse to Martha : ' I have been young , and now am old ; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread . '
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 18]: If you are minded to look it up , you will find it in the Thirty-seventh Psalm .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 43]: `` I do n't want to pretend that the blow has not been a hard one , but , God willing , there will be a hamper for you at Christmas , if Colonel Grant is too busy to bring you North .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 7]: Your mother joins in much love .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 9]: `` Your affect. , `` JOHN BOLLAND . ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 19]: `` P. S. -- Maybe you will not have forgotten that Mrs. Saumarez said the land needed draining .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 10]: She was a clever woman in some ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 8]: The boy 's eyes filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 14]: He understood only too well the far-reaching misfortune which had befallen the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 27]: The total value of the herd was # 5,000 , and he remembered that experts valued the young surviving bull at # 300 as a yearling .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 31]: In all , twenty-three animals had been slaughtered by the law 's decree , and the compensation payable to Bolland would not cover a twentieth part of the actual loss .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 30]: Martin not only wrote a letter of warm sympathy to his adopted parents but sent Bolland 's letter to his father , with an added commentary of his own .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 12]: Colonel Grant obtained short leave and traveled to Elmsdale next day .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 62]: It took some trouble to bring John round to his point of view , but the argument that the farm should be restocked in Martin 's interests prevailed , and negotiations were opened with prominent breeders elsewhere which resulted in the purchase of a notable bull and eight heifers , for which Bolland and the colonel each found half the money .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 30]: The farmer would listen to no other arrangement , though he promised that if he experienced any tightness for money he would not hesitate to apply for further help .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 7]: The need never made itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 13]: The first animal to produce successful progeny was George Pickering 's cow !
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 14]: No man in the North Riding was more pleased than John that day .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 22]: Throughout the whole of his life the only person who ever brought a charge of unfair dealing against him was Pickering .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 30]: The memory rankled , and its sting was none the less bitter because of a secret dread that he had perhaps been guilty of a piece of sharp practice .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 6]: Now his character was cleared .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 28]: Pattison , his old crony , asked him , by way of a joke , how much `` he 'd tak ' for t ' cauf . ''
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 6]: John blazed into unexpected anger .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 16]: `` At what figger de you reckon yer own good ne√§m , Mr. Pattison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 21]: `` I do n't kno√§ as I 'd care te sell it at onny price , Mr. Bollan ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 12]: `` Then ye 'll think as I do aboot yon cauf .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 22]: Neyther it nor any other of its dam 's produce will ivver leave my farm if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 59]: CHAPTER XIX OUT OF THE MISTS This record of a Yorkshire village -- a true chronicle of life among the canny folk who dwell on the `` moor edge '' -- might well be left at the point it reached when one of its chief characters saw before him the smooth and sunlit road of a notable career .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 23]: But history , though romantic , is not writ as romance , and the story of Elmsdale is fact , not fiction .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 10]: After eight years of somnolence the village awoke again .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 30]: It was roused from sleep by the tumult of a world at war ; mayhap the present generation shall pass away before the hamlet relapses into its humdrum ways .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 33]: Martin was twenty-two when his father and he journeyed north to attend the annual sale of the Elmsdale herd , which was fixed for the two opening days of July , 1914 .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 40]: Each year Colonel Grant brought his son to the village for six weeks prior to the twelfth of August ; this year there was a well-founded rumor in the little community that the colonel meant to buy The Elms .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 21]: The announcement of Bolland 's sale brought foreign agents from abroad and well-known stock-raisers from all parts of the Kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 10]: No less than forty animals entered the auction ring .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 11]: One bull , Bainesse Boy IV. , realized # 800 .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 4]: Bainesse Boy IV .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 10]: held a species of levee in a special stall .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 7]: He had grown into a wonder .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 66]: On a table , over which Sergeant Benson mounted guard , were displayed five championship cups he had carried off , while fifteen cards , arranged in horseshoe pattern on the wall , each bore the magic words , `` First Prize , '' awarded at Islington , Birmingham , the Royal , and wherever else in Britain shorthorns and their admirers most do congregate .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 47]: The village hummed with life ; around the sale ring gathered a multitude of men arrayed in Melton cloth and leather leggings , whose general appearance betokened the wisdom of Dr. Johnson 's sarcastic dictum : `` Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat . ''
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 18]: Martha and a cohort of maids boiled hams by the dozen and baked cakes in fabulous quantities .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 24]: John graced the occasion by donning a new suit and new boots , in which the crooked giant was singularly ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 40]: Mrs. Pickering drove over from Nottonby -- Kitty was married two years before to a well-to-do farmer at Northallerton -- and someone rallied her on `` bein ' ower good-lookin ' te remain a widow all her days . ''
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 4]: She laughed pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 55]: `` I 'm far too busy at Wetherby to think of adding a husband to my cares , '' she said ; but those who knew her best could have told that she had refused at least two excellent offers of matrimony and meant to remain Mrs. Pickering during the rest of her days .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 53]: At the close of the second day 's sale , when the crowd was thinned by the departure of a fleet of cars and a local train at five o'clock , the White House was thronged by its habitu√©s , who came to make a meal of the `` high tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 32]: Colonel Grant and John had just concluded an amicable wrangle whereby it was decided that they should jointly provide the considerable sum needed to acquire The Elms and some adjoining land .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 18]: The house and grounds were to be remodeled and the property would be deeded to Martin forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 55]: The young gentleman himself , as tall as his father now , and wearing riding breeches and boots , was standing at the front door , turning impatient eyes from a smart cob , held by a groom , to the bend in the road where it curved beyond the `` Black Lion . ''
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 26]: A smartly-dressed young lady passed , and although Martin lifted his hat with a ready smile his glance wandered from her along the road again .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 12]: Evelyn Atkinson wondered who it was that thus distracted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 22]: A few yards farther on , Elsie Herbert , mounted on a steady old hunter , passed at a sharp trot .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 7]: Evelyn 's pretty face frowned slightly .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 25]: `` If _ she _ is home again , of course , he has eyes for nobody else , '' she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 8]: And , indeed , it was true .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 9]: Elsie had been to Dresden for two years .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 22]: She had returned to Elmsdale the previous day , and a scribbled note told Martin to look for her after tea .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 14]: The two set off together through the village , bound for the moor .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 7]: Many a critical look followed them .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 21]: `` Eh , but they 're a bonny pair , '' cried Mrs. Summersgill , who became stouter each year .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 31]: `` Martin allus framed to be a fine man , but I nivver thowt yon gawky lass o ' t ' vicar 's ` ud grow into a beauty . ''
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 7]: `` This moor air is wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 23]: Look at the effect it has on you , Mrs. Summersgill , '' said Colonel Grant with a twinkle in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 22]: `` Oh , go on wi ' ye , Colonel , pokin ' fun at a poor owd body like me .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 13]: But I de√§n ' t ho 'd wi ' skinny ` uns .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 18]: Martha , what 's become o ' Mrs. Saumarez an ' that flighty gell o ' hers .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 8]: What did they call her -- Angel ?
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 3]: My word !
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 17]: -- a nice angel -- not that she was n't as thin as a sperrit . ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 22]: `` Miss Walker told me , last Christmas twel ` month , they were i ' France , '' said Martha .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 3]: `` France ?
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 18]: Ay , maist like ; it 's a God-forsaken place , I 'll be boun ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 19]: `` Nay , '' interposed Bolland , `` that 's an unchristian description of onny counthry , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 19]: Ye 'll find t ' Lord ivverywhere i ' t ' wide wulld , if ye seek Him .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 29]: There 's bin times when He might easy be i ' France , for He seemed , iv His wisdom , to be far away frae Elmsdale . ''
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 16]: Mrs. Summersgill snorted contempt for all `` furriners , '' but Martha created a diversion .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 5]: `` Goodness me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 9]: she cried , `` yer cup 's empty .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 8]: I nivver did see sike a woman .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 8]: Ye talk an ' eat nowt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 38]: Martin , now in his third year at Oxford , was somewhat mystified by the change brought about in Elsie by two years of `` languages and music '' passed in the most attractive of German cities .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 9]: Though not flippant , her manner nonplussed him .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 13]: She was distinctly `` smart , '' both in speech and style .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 27]: She treated a young gentleman who had already taken his degree and was reading for honors in history with an easy nonchalance that was highly disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 24]: The last time they parted they had kissed each other , she with tears , and he with a lump in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 32]: Now he dared no more offer a cousinly , or brotherly , or any other sort of salute in which kissing was essential , than if she were a royal princess .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 34]: `` You 've altered , old girl , '' he said by way of a conversational opening when their horses were content to walk , after a sharp canter along a moorland track .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 14]: `` I should hope so , indeed , '' came the airy retort .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 23]: `` Surely , you did n't expect to find the Elmsdale label on me after two years of _ kultur _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 14]: `` Whatever the label , the vintage looks good , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 12]: `` You mean that as a compliment , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 17]: `` And , now that I look at you carefully , I see signs of improvement .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 18]: Of course , the Oxford swank is an abomination , but you 'll lose it in time .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 16]: Father told me last night that you were going in for the law and politics .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 5]: Is that correct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 19]: Martin , masterful as ever , was not minded to endure such supercilious treatment at Elsie 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 43]: He had looked forward to this meeting with a longing that had almost interfered with his work ; it was more than irritating to find his divinity modeling her behavior on the lines of the Girton `` set '' at the University .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 14]: They had reached a point of the high moor which overlooked Thor ghyll .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 8]: Martin pulled up his cob and dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 14]: `` Let 's give the nags a breather here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 7]: `` Shall I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 6]: `` No , thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 8]: Elsie was out of the saddle promptly .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 4]: She rode astride .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 31]: In a well-fitting habit , with divided skirt and patent-leather boots , she looked wonderfully alluring , but her air of aloofness was carried almost to the verge of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 19]: She showed some surprise when Martin took her horse 's reins and threw them over his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 9]: `` Are you going to lecture me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 7]: she said , arching her eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 38]: `` It would be just like a fledgling B. A. , who is doubtless a member of the Officers ' Training Corps , to tell me that my German riding-master taught me to sit too stiffly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 16]: `` He did , '' said Martin , meeting the sarcastic blue eyes without flinching .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 20]: `` But a few days with the York and Ainsty and Lord Middleton 's pack will put that right .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 19]: You 'll come a purler at your first stone wall if you ride with such long stirrup leathers .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 13]: However , I want you to jump another variety of obstacle to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 17]: You asked me just now , Elsie , if I was going in for the law .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 9]: But I 'm going in for you first .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 8]: You know I love you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 42]: You know I have been your very humble but loyal knight ever since I won your recognition down there in the valley , when I was only a farmer 's son and you were a girl of a higher social order .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 30]: I have never forgotten that you did n't seem to heed class distinctions then , Elsie , and it hurts now to have you treat me with coldness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 21]: Elsie , trying valiantly to appear partly indignant and even more amused at this direct attack , failed most lamentably .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 8]: First she flushed ; then she paled .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 33]: She faced Martin 's gaze confidently enough at the outset , but her eyes dropped and her lips quivered when she heard the words which no woman can hear without a thrill .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 12]: Still , she made a brave attempt to rally her forces .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 36]: `` I did n't -- quite mean -- what you say , '' she faltered , which was a schoolgirl form of protest for one who had achieved distinction in a course of English literature .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 7]: Martin took her by the shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 7]: The two horses nosed each other .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 26]: They , perforce , were dumb , but their wise eye 's seemed to exchange the caustic comment : `` What fools these mortals be !
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 12]: Why do n't they hug , and settle the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 16]: `` I must know what you do mean , '' said Martin , almost fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 7]: `` I love you , Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 6]: Will you marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 5]: She lifted her face .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 17]: The blue eyes were dim with tears , but the adorable mouth trembled in a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 9]: `` Yes , dear , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 7]: `` But what did you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 19]: Did you -- think I would -- throw my arms around you -- in the village street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 16]: After that Martin had no reason to accuse Elsie of being either stiff or cold .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 25]: When the vicar heard the news that night -- for Martin and the colonel dined at the Vicarage -- he stormed into mock dissent .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 39]: `` God bless my soul , '' he cried , `` my little girl has been away two whole years , and you come and steal her away from me before she has been home twenty-four hours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 18]: Then he produced a handkerchief and yielded , apparently , to a violent attack of hay fever .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 34]: Yet it was a joyous company which gathered around the dinner table , for Elsie herself , casting off the veneer of Dresden , drove posthaste to summon the Bollands to the feast .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 13]: John was specially deputed by Colonel Grant to make a significant announcement .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 31]: `` We 're all main pleased you two hev sattled matters so soon , '' he said , peering alternately at Martin 's attentive face and Elsie 's blushing one .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 42]: `` Yer father an ' me hev bowt The Elms , an ' a tidy bit o ' land besides , so ye 'll hev a stake i ' t ' county if ivver ye 're minded te run for Parlyment .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 25]: The Miss Walkers -LRB- John pronounced the name `` Wahker '' -RRB- are goin ' te live in a small hoos i ' Nottonby .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 49]: They 've gotten a fine lot o ' Spanish mahogany an ' owd oak which they 're willin ' te sell by vallyation ; so the pair of ye can gan there i ' t ' mornin ' an ' pick an ' choose what ye want . ''
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 13]: Elsie looked at her father , but neither could utter a word .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 11]: Martha Bolland put an arm around the girl 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 9]: `` Lord luv ' ye , honey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 15]: she said brokenly , `` it 'll be just like crossin ' the road .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 30]: May I be spared te see you happy and comfortable in yer new home , for you 'll surely be one of the finest ladies i ' Yorkshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 10]: No shadow darkened their joy in that cheerful hour .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 21]: Even next day , when a grim specter flitted through Elmsdale , the ominous vision evoked only a passing notice .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 34]: Colonel Grant and the vicar , each an expert in old furniture , accompanied the young people to The Elms and examined its antique dressers , sideboards , tables , and the rest .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 10]: Many of the bedroom chests were of solid mahogany .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 24]: The Misses Walker had cleared the drawers of the lumber of years , so that the prospective purchasers could note the interior finish .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 23]: Miss Emmy , not so tactful as her elder sister , brought in a name which the others present wished to forget .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 31]: `` Mrs. Saumarez used this room as a dressing-room , '' she said , `` and while turning out rubbish from a set of drawers I came across this . ''
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 15]: She displayed a small red-covered folding road-map , such as cyclists and motorists use .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 6]: Martin thought he recognized it .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 22]: `` I believe that is the very map lost by Fritz Bauer , Mrs. Saumarez 's chauffeur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 5]: `` Probably , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 11]: He made a rare row with Miss Ang√®le about it .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 10]: I was half afraid he meant to shake her .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 21]: No one knew what had become of it , but either Miss Ang√®le or her mother must have hidden it .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 8]: Why , I ca n't guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 9]: Elsie helped to smooth over an awkward incident .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 10]: She took the map and began to open it .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 15]: `` It could n't have been such an important matter , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 29]: Then she shook apart the folded sheet , and they all saw that it bore a number of entries and signs in faded ink , black and red .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 15]: The written words were in German , and Elsie scanned a few lines hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 16]: She looked puzzled , even a trifle perturbed , but recovered her smiling self-possession instantly .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 21]: `` The poor man , being a foreigner , jotted down some notes for his guidance , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 7]: `` May I have it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 12]: `` With pleasure , miss , '' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 17]: It was not until the party had returned to the vicarage that Elsie explained her request .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 16]: She spread the map on a table , and her smooth forehead wrinkled in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 9]: `` This is serious , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 48]: `` I have lived in Germany long enough to understand that one can not mix with German girls in the intimacy of school and at their homes without knowing that an attack on England is simply an obsession of their menfolk , and even of the women .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 25]: They regard it as a certainty in the near future , pretending that if they do n't strike first England will crush them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 9]: `` I wish to Heaven she would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 6]: broke in Colonel Grant emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 24]: `` In existing conditions this country resembles an unarmed policeman waiting for a burglar to fire at him out of the darkness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 23]: Mr. Herbert , man of peace that he was , might have voiced a mild disclaimer , had not Elsie stayed him .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 10]: `` Listen , father , '' she said seriously .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 6]: `` Here is proof positive .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 7]: That chauffeur was a military spy .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 27]: See what is written across the top of the map : ` Gutes Wasser ; Futter in F√ºlle ; √úberfluss von Vieh , Schafen und Pferden .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 7]: Einzelheiten auf genauen Ortlichkeiten angegeben . '
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 19]: That means ` Good water ; abundance of fodder ; plenty of cattle , sheep , and horses .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 7]: Details given on exact localities . '
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 8]: And , just look at the details !
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 10]: Could a child fail to interpret their meaning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 24]: Elsie 's simile was not far-fetched , yet gray-headed statesmen , though they may have both known and understood , refused to believe .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 27]: That little road-map , on a scale of one mile to an inch , contained all the information needed by the staff of an invading army .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 23]: The moor bore the legend : `` Platz f√ºr Lager , leicht verschanzt ; beherrscht Hauptstrassen von Whitby und Pickering nach York .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 11]: Rote Kreise kennzeichnen reichlichen Wasservorrat f√ºr Kavallerie und Artillerie . ''
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 8]: -LRB- Site for camp , easily entrenched .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 10]: Commands main roads from Whitby and Pickering to York .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 12]: Red circles show ample water supply for cavalry and artillery . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 22]: Every road bore its classification for the use of troops , showing the width , quality of surface , and gradients .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 13]: Each bridge was described as `` stone '' or `` iron . ''
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 15]: Even cross-country trails were indicated when fordable streams rendered such passage not too difficult .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 27]: The little group gazed spellbound at the extraordinarily accurate synopsis of the facilities offered by the placid country of Yorkshire for the devilish purposes of war .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 13]: Martin , in particular , devoured the entries relating to the moor .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 32]: On Metcalf 's farm he saw : `` Six hundred sheep here , '' and at the Broad Ings , `` Four hundred sheep , three horses , four cows . ''
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 11]: Well he knew who had given the spy those facts .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 8]: His glowing eyes wandered to the village .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 26]: A long entry distinguished the White House , and though he knew a good deal of German he was beaten by the opening technical word .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 8]: `` What is that , Elsie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 16]: he said , and even his father wondered at the hot anger in his utterance .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 24]: The girl read : `` Stammbaum Vieh hier ; drei Stiere , achtzehn K√ºhe und F√§rsen , nicht zum Schlachten , sehr wertvoll .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 11]: Neben bei sechs Stuten , besten Types zur Zucht . ''
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 25]: Then she translated : `` Pedigree cattle here ; three bulls , eighteen cows and heifers , not to be slaughtered ; very valuable .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 11]: Also six brood mares of best type for stud . ''
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 6]: `` The infernal scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 4]: blazed out Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 20]: `` So the Bolland stock must be taken to the Fatherland , and not eaten or drafted into service !
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 13]: And to think that I gave him nearly all that information ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 6]: `` You , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 3]: cried Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 5]: He pumped me dry .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 14]: I even showed him the site of every pond on the moor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 13]: `` Do n't blame the man , '' put in Colonel Grant .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 13]: `` I knew him as a Prussian officer at the first glance .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 8]: But he was simply doing his duty .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 5]: Blame our criminal carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 34]: We can not stop foreigners from prowling about the country , but we can and should make it impossible for any enemy to utilize such data as are contained in this map . ''
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 12]: `` But , consider , '' put in the perturbed vicar .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 22]: `` This evil work was done eight years ago , and what has all the talk of German preparation come to ?
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 11]: Is n't it the bombast of militarism gone mad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 11]: `` It comes to this , '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 9]: `` We are just eight years nearer war .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 42]: I am convinced that the break must occur before 1916 -- and for two reasons : Germany 's financial state is dangerous , and in 1916 Russia will have completed on her western frontier certain strategic lines which will expedite mobilization .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 11]: Germany wo n't wait till her prospective foes are ready .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 4]: France knows it .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 14]: That is why she has adopted the three years ' service scheme . ''
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 15]: `` Then why wo n't you let me join the army , dad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 4]: demanded Martin bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 20]: Colonel Grant spread his hands with the weary gesture of a man who would willingly shirk a vital decision .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 14]: `` In peace the army is a poor career , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 11]: `` The law and politics offer you a wider field .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 17]: But not you only -- every young man in the country should be trained to arms .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 13]: As matters stand , we have neither the men nor the rifles .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 26]: Our artillery , excellent of its type , is about sufficient for an army corps , and we have a fortnight 's supply of ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 6]: I am not an alarmist .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 51]: We have enough regiments to repel a raid , supposing the enemy 's transports dodged the fleet ; but Heaven help us if we dream of sending an expeditionary force to France or Egypt , or any single one of a score of vulnerable points outside the British Isles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 36]: `` Beckett-Smythe retained one of those German chauffeurs in his service for a whole year , '' said the vicar , on whom a new light had dawned with the discovery of the telltale map .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 13]: `` Are there many of the brood in the district now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 4]: inquired the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 6]: `` I fancy not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 16]: `` There is no need , they have done their work , '' said Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 30]: `` Last winter I met a young officer in Dresden , and he told me he had taken a walking tour through this part of Yorkshire during the summer .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 6]: He knew Elmsdale quite well .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 13]: He remembered the vicarage , The Elms , and the White House .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 11]: Yet he said he was here only a day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 17]: `` Fritz Bauer 's maps are the best of guides , '' commented Colonel Grant bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 6]: The vicar was literally awe-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 6]: He stooped over the map .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 14]: `` Is this sort of thing going on all over the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 5]: `` More or less .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 22]: Naturally , the east coast has been the chief hunting ground , as that must provide the terrain of any attack .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 34]: Of course , so long as the political sky remains fairly clear , as it is at this moment , there is always a chance that humanity will escape Armageddon for another generation .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 15]: The world is growing more rational and its interests are becoming ever more identical .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 21]: Even the Junkers are feeling the pressure of public opinion , and the great masses of the people demand peace .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 20]: That is why I want Martin to learn the power of voice and pen rather than of the sword .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 15]: I have been a soldier all my life , and I hate war ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 18]: The man who had so often faced death in his country 's cause spoke with real feeling .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 14]: He longed to make war impossible by making victory impossible for an aggressor .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 21]: He claimed no rights for Britain that he would deny Germany or any other country in the comity of nations .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 12]: Suddenly he took the map off the table and folded it .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 16]: `` I 'll send this curio to Whitehall , '' he said with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 10]: `` It will form part of a queer collection .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 35]: Now , let 's talk of something else ... Martin , after the valuer has inspected that furniture , you might see to it that the whole lot is stored in the east bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 12]: The architect will not disturb that part of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 12]: `` Oh , when can we look at the plans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 4]: chimed in Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 34]: These four people , who in their way fairly represented the forty millions of Great Britain , discussed the spy 's map in the drawing-room of Elmsdale vicarage on July 6th , 1914 .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 36]: On the sixth of August , exactly one month later , two German army corps , with full artillery and commissariat trains , were loaded into transports and brought to the mouth of the Elbe .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 20]: They hoped to avoid the British fleet , and their objective was the Yorkshire coast between Whitby and Filey .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 13]: Once ashore , they meant entrenching a camp on the Elmsdale moor .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 14]: Obviously , they did not dream of conquering England by one daring foray .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 20]: Their purpose was to keep the small army of Britain fully occupied until France was humbled to the dust .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 9]: They would lose the whole hundred thousand men .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 5]: But what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 30]: German soldiers are regarded as cannon fodder by their rulers , and the price in human lives would not be too costly if it retained British troops at home .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 16]: It was an audacious scheme , and audacity is the first principle of successful war .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 29]: Its very spine and marrow was the knowledge of the North and East Ridings gained in time of peace by the officers who would lead the invading host .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 34]: That it failed was due to England 's sailors , the men who broke Napoleon , and were destined , by God 's good grace , to break the robber empire of Germany .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 17]: CHAPTER XX THE RIGOR OF THE GAME Elmsdale at war is very like Elmsdale in peace .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 28]: At least , that was Martin 's first impression when he and General Grant motored to the village from York on a day in September , 1915 .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 29]: Father and son had passed unscathed through the hellfire of Loos , General Grant in command of a brigade , and Martin a captain in a Kitchener battalion .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 34]: They were in England on leave now , the middle-aged general for five days , and the youthful captain for ten , and the purpose of this joint home-coming was Martin 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 43]: When it became evident that the world struggle would last years rather than months , General Grant and the vicar put their heads together , metaphorically speaking , since the connecting link was the field post-office , and arranged a war wedding .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 7]: Why should the young people wait ?
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 3]: they argued .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 7]: Every consideration pointed the other way .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 39]: With Martin wedded to Elsie , legal formalities as to Bolland 's and the general 's estate could be completed , and if Heaven blessed the union with children the continuity of two old families would be assured .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 78]: So , to Martin 's intense surprise , he was called to the telephone one Saturday morning in the trenches and told that he had better hand over his company to the senior subaltern as speedily as might be , since his ten days ' leave began on the Monday , such being the amiable device by which commanding officers permit juniors to reach Blighty before an all-too-brief respite from the business of killing Germans begins officially .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 39]: He met his father at Boulogne , and there learnt that which he had only suspected hitherto : he and Elsie were booked for an immediate honeymoon on a Scottish moor -- at Cairn-corrie , to be exact .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 32]: By chance the two travelers ran into Frank Beckett-Smythe , a gunner lieutenant in London , and he undertook to rush north that night to act as `` best man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 27]: Father and son caught a train early on Sunday and hired a car at York , Elmsdale having no railway facilities on the day of rest .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 29]: They arrived in time to attend the evening service at the parish church , to which , _ mirabile dictu _ , John and Martha Bolland accompanied them .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 36]: The war has broken down many barriers , but few things have crumbled to ruin more speedily than the walls of prejudice and sectarian futilities which separated the many phases of religious thought in Britain .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 38]: The church , with its small graveyard , stood in the center of the village , and the Grants had to wring scores of friendly hands before they and the others walked to the vicarage for supper .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 18]: Martin and Elsie contrived to extricate themselves from the crowd slightly in advance of the older people .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 5]: They felt absurdly shy .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 6]: They were wandering in dreamland .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 9]: Early next morning Martin strolled into the village .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 27]: He wanted to stir the sluggish current of enlistment , for England was then making a final effort to maintain her army on a voluntary basis .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 9]: Elmsdale was so unchanged outwardly that he marveled .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 11]: He hardly realized that it could not well be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 27]: He had seen so many French hamlets torn by war that the snug content of this sheltered nook in rural Yorkshire was almost uncanny by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 11]: The very familiarity of the scene formed its strangest element .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 26]: Its sights , its sounds , its homely voices , were novel to the senses of one whose normal surroundings were the abominations of war .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 17]: Here were trim houses and well-filled stockyards , smiling orchards and cattle grazing in green pastures .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 4]: Everywhere was peace .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 21]: He was the only man in uniform , until Sergeant Benson appeared in the doorway of a cottage and saluted .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 60]: The village had its own liveries -- the corduroys of the carpenter , redolent of oil and turpentine , the tied-up trouser legs of the laborer , the blacksmith 's leather apron , ragged and burnt , a true Vulcan 's robe , the shoemaker 's , shiny with the stropping of knives and seamed with cobbler 's wax .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 14]: The panoply of Mars looked singularly out of place in this Sleepy Hollow .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 11]: But , by degrees , he began to miss things .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 9]: There were no young men in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 22]: All the horses had gone , save the yearlings and those too old for the hard work of artillery and transport .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 20]: He questioned Benson and found that little Elmsdale had not escaped the levy laid on the rest of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 8]: Jim Bates was in the Yorkshire Regiment .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 15]: Tommy Beadlam 's white head was resting forever in a destroyed trench at Ypres .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 7]: Tom Chandler had fallen at Gallipoli .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 18]: Evelyn Atkinson was a nurse , and her two sisters were `` in munitions '' at Leeds .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 11]: Yes , there were some shirkers , but not many .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 13]: For the most part , they were hidden in the moorland farms .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 10]: `` T ' captain '' would remember Georgie Jackson ?
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 17]: Well , he was one of the stand-backs -- would n't go till he was fetched .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 28]: The village girls made his life a misery , so he `` hired '' at the Broad Ings , miles away in the depths of the moor .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 26]: One night about a month ago one of those `` d -- d Zeppelines '' dropped a bomb on the heather , which caught fire .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 19]: A second , following a murder trail to Newcastle , saw the resultant blaze and dropped twelve bombs .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 20]: A third , believing that real damage was being done , flung out its whole cargo of twenty-nine bombs .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 26]: `` So , now , sir , '' grinned Benson , `` there 's a fine lot o ' pot-holes i ' t ' moor .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 5]: Georgie was badly scairt .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 18]: He saw the three Zepps , an ' t ' bombs fell all over t ' farm .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 13]: Next mornin ' he f ` und three sheep banged te bits .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 6]: An ' what d'ye think ?
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 10]: He went straight te Whitby an ' ` listed .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 25]: He hez a bunch o ' singed wool in his pocket , an ' sweers he 'll mak ' some Jarman eat it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 79]: So Martin only recruited a wife that day , and evidently secured a sensible one , for Elsie , taking thought , on hearing certain vivid descriptions of trench life on the Sunday evening , vetoed the wedding trip to Scotland , and persuaded her husband to `` go the limit '' in London , where plenty of society and a round of theaters acted as a wholesome tonic after the monotony of high-explosive existence in a dugout .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 19]: * * * * * In February , 1917 , Martin was `` in billets '' at Armenti√®res .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 49]: He had been promoted to the staff , and had fairly earned this coveted recognition by a series of daring excursions into `` No Man 's Land '' every night for a week , which enabled him to plan an attack on the German lines at Chapelle d'Armenti√®res .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 20]: Never thinking of any personal gain , he drew up a memorandum , which he submitted to his colonel .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 14]: The latter sent the document to Divisional Headquarters ; the scheme was approved .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 55]: Fritz was pushed forcibly half a mile nearer Lille , and `` Captain Reginald Ingram Grant '' was informed , in the dry language of the _ Gazette _ , that in future he would wear a red band around his field service cap and little red tabs on the shoulders of his tunic .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 29]: That was a great day for him , but his elation was as nothing compared with the joy of Elmsdale when the _ Messenger _ reprinted the announcement .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 27]: Elsie , of course , imagined that her husband was now comparatively safe for the rest of the war , and he has never undeceived her .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 33]: As a matter of fact , his first real `` job '' was to carry out a fresh series of observations at a point south of Armenti√®res along the road to Arras .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 25]: This might involve another six days of lurking in dugouts at the front and six nights of crawling through and under German barbed wire .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 9]: His companion was a sapper sergeant named Mason .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 39]: They suspected that the German position was heavily mined in anticipation of an attack at that very point , and it was part of their business at the outset to ascertain whether or not this was the case .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 39]: The enemy 's lines were about one hundred and fifty yards away , and all observers agree that the chief difficulty experienced in the pitch-black darkness of a cloudy , moonless night is to estimate the distance covered .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 33]: Crawling over shell-torn ground , slow work at the best , is rendered slower by the frequent waits necessary while rockets flare overhead and Verrey lights describe brilliant parabolas in unexpected directions .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 63]: Martin , up to every trick and dodge of the `` listening post , '' surveyed the field of operations through a periscope , and noticed that one of the ditches which mark boundaries in northern France ran almost in a straight line from the British trenches to the German , and had at one time been reinforced by posts and rails .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 20]: The fence was destroyed , but many of the posts remained , some intact , others mere jagged stumps .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 44]: He estimated that the nineteenth was not more than a couple of yards from the enemy 's wire , and knew of old that it was in just such an irregular hollow he might expect to find a weak place in the entanglement .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 5]: Mason agreed with him .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 19]: `` We can save a lot of time by following that trail , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 23]: `` There 's only one drawback -- '' `` That Fritz may have hit on the same scheme , '' laughed Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 10]: `` Possible ; but we must chance it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 7]: Mason and he were old associates .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 20]: They had perfected a code of signals , by touch , that enabled them to work in absolute silence .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 26]: Thus , a slight hold meant `` Halt '' ; a slight push , `` Advance '' ; a slight pull , `` Retire . ''
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 19]: Each carried a trench knife and a revolver , the latter for use as a last resource only .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 11]: They were not going out for fighting but for observation .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 11]: If enemy patrols were encountered , they must be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 14]: Germans are not phlegmatic , but , on the contrary , highly nervous .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 35]: Continuous raids by British bombing parties had put sentries `` on the jump , '' and the least noise which was not explained by a whispered password attracted a heavy spray of machine-gun fire .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 11]: Especially was this the case during the hour before dawn .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 43]: By hurrying out immediately after darkness set in , the two counted on nearing the German front-line trench at a time when reliefs were being posted and fatigue parties were plodding to the `` dump '' for the next day 's rations .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 9]: `` What time will you be back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 16]: inquired the subaltern in charge of the platoon holding that part of the British trench .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 19]: It was his duty to warn sentries to be on the lookout for the return of scouting parties .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 10]: Martin glanced at the luminous watch on his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 16]: It was then seven o'clock , and the night promised to be dark and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 25]: The evening `` strafe '' had just ended , and the German guns would reopen fire on the trenches about five in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 33]: During the intervening hours the artillery would indulge in groups of long shots , hoping to catch the commissariat or a regiment marching on the _ pav√© _ in column of fours .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 8]: `` About twelve , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 8]: `` Well , so long , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 8]: I 'll have some coffee ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 5]: `` So long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 10]: And Martin led the way up a trench ladder .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 9]: No man wishes another `` Good luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 4]: in these enterprises .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 12]: By a curious inversion of meaning , `` Good luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 10]: implies a ninety per cent chance of getting killed !
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 10]: The two advanced rapidly for the first hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 19]: Then they separated , each crawling out into the open for about twenty yards to right and left .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 38]: Snuggling into a convenient shell hole , they would listen intently , with an ear to the ground , their object being to detect the rhythmic beat of a pick , if a mining party was busy .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 6]: Each remained exactly ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 11]: Then they met and compared notes , always by signal .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 20]: If necessary , they would visit a suspected locality together and endeavor to locate the line of the tunnel .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 20]: It was essential that the British side of `` No Man 's Land '' should not be too quiet .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 16]: Every few minutes a rocket or a Verrey light would soar over that torn Golgotha .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 9]: But there was method in the seeming madness .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 16]: The first and second glare would illuminate an area well removed from Martin 's territory .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 27]: The third might be right over him or Mason , but they were then so well hidden that the sharpest eye could not discern their presence .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 25]: By nine o'clock they had covered more than a hundred yards of the enemy 's front , skirting his trip-wire throughout the whole distance .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 10]: They had heard no fewer than six mining parties .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 7]: Each had advanced some thirty yards .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 31]: In effect , if the German trench was to be taken at all , the attack must be made next day , and the artillery preparation should commence at dawn .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 28]: Instead of returning to the subaltern 's dugout at midnight , Martin wanted to reach the telephone not later than ten , and hurry back to headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 32]: The staff would have another sleepless night , but a British battalion would not be blown up while its successive `` waves '' were crossing `` No Man 's Land . ''
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 11]: Mason and he crept like lizards to the sunk fence .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 16]: All they needed now was a close scrutiny of the German parapet in that section .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 26]: It was a likely site for a machine-gun emplacement and , in that case , would receive special attention from a battery of 4.7 's .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 12]: They reached the ditch shortly before a rocket was due overhead .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 33]: Making assurance doubly sure , they flattened against the outer slope of a shell hole , took off their caps , and each sought a tuft of grass through which to peer .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 12]: Simultaneously , by two short taps , both conveyed a warning .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 10]: They had heard a slight rustling directly in front .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 14]: A Verrey light , and not a rocket , flamed through the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 5]: Its brilliancy was intense .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 32]: But the Verrey light has a peculiar property : far more effective than the rocket when it reveals troops in motion , it is rendered practically useless if men remain still .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 12]: Working parties and scouts counteract its vivid beams by absolute rigidity .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 28]: The uplifted pick or hammer , the advanced foot , the raised arm , must be kept in statuesque repose , and the reward is complete safety .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 44]: A rocket , on the other hand , though not half so deadly in exposing an attack , demands that every man within its periphery shall endeavor forthwith to blend with the earth , or he will surely be seen and shot at .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 31]: The two Britons , looking through stalks of withered herbage , found themselves gazing into the eyes of a couple of Germans crouching on the level barely six feet away .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 13]: It seemed literally impossible that the enemy observers should not see them .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 7]: But strange things happen in war .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 26]: The Germans were scanning all the visible ground ; the Englishmen happened to be on the alert for a recognized danger in that identical spot .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 23]: So the one party , watching space , saw nothing ; the other , prepared for a specific discovery , made it .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 35]: What was more , when the light failed , the Germans were assured of comparative safety , while their opponents had measured the extent of an instant peril and got ready to face it .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 14]: They knew , too , that the Germans must be killed or captured .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 56]: One was a major , the other a noncommissioned officer , and men of such rank were seldom deputed by the enemy to roam at large through the strip of debated land which British endeavor , drawn by its sporting uncertainties , had rendered most unhealthy for human `` game '' of the Hun species .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 20]: A dark night in that part of French Flanders becomes palpably black during a few seconds after a flare .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 8]: The Englishmen squatted back on their heels .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 44]: Neither drew his revolver , but each right hand clutched a trench knife , a peculiarly murderous-looking implement with an oval handle , and shaped like a corkscrew , except that the screw is replaced by a short , flat , dagger-pointed blade .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 5]: No signal was needed .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 7]: Each knew exactly what to do .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 10]: The accident of position allotted the major to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 6]: The Germans came on stealthily .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 25]: They had noted the shell-hole , and sat on its crumbling edge , meaning to slide down and creep out on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 12]: Martin 's left hand gripped a stout boot by the ankle .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 28]: In the fifth of a second he had a heavy body twisted violently and flung face down in the loose earth at the bottom of the hole .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 48]: A knee was planted in the small of the prisoner 's back , the point of the knife was under his right ear , and Martin was saying , in quite understandable German : `` If you move or speak , I 'll cut your throat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 32]: The words have a brutal sound , but it does not pay to be squeamish on such occasions , and the German language adapts itself naturally to phrases of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 13]: Sergeant Mason had to solve his own problem by a different method .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 17]: The quarry chanced to be leaning forward at the moment a vicious tug accelerated his progress .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 22]: As a result , he fell on top of the hunter , and there was nothing for it but the knife .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 17]: A ghastly squeal was barely stifled by the Englishman 's hand over the victim 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 22]: At thirty yards , or thereabouts , and coming from a deep hole , the noise might have been a grunt .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 8]: Nevertheless , it reached the German trench .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 5]: `` Wer da ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 19]: hissed a voice , and Martin heard the click of a machine-gun as it swung on its tripod .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 20]: He did not fear the gun , which only meant a period of waiting while its bullets cracked overhead .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 21]: What he did dread was a search party , as German majors are valuable birds , and must be safeguarded .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 10]: The situation called for the desperate measure he took .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 30]: The point of the knife entered his captive 's neck , and he whispered : `` Tell your men they must keep quiet , or you die now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 11]: He allowed the almost choking man to raise his head .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 16]: The German knew that his life was forfeit if he did not obey the order .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 18]: A certain gurgling , ever growing weaker , showed that his companion would soon be a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 9]: `` Shut up , sheep 's head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 3]: It sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 11]: That is the way German majors talk to their inferiors .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 6]: The engineer sergeant wriggled nearer .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 12]: `` Could n't help it , sir , '' he breathed .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 9]: `` I had to give him one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 13]: `` Go through him for papers and bring me his belt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 13]: Within a minute the officer 's hands were fastened behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 18]: Then he was permitted to rise and , after being duly warned , told to accompany Mason .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 11]: Martin followed , and the three began the return journey .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 18]: A German rocket bothered them once , but the German was quick as they to fall flat .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 15]: Evidently he was not minded to offer a target for marksmen on either side .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 10]: Soon Mason was sent forward to warn the sentries .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 34]: Quarter of an hour after the episode in the shell hole Martin , having come from the telephone , was examining his prisoner by the light of an electric torch in a dugout .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 17]: `` Freiherr Georg von Struben , major of artillery , '' was the somewhat grandiloquent answer .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 7]: `` Do you speak English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 5]: `` Nod mooch . ''
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 12]: Some long dormant chord of memory vibrated in Martin 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 6]: He held the torch closer .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 9]: Von Struben was a tall , well-built Prussian .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 14]: He smiled , meaning probably to make the best of a bad business .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 9]: His face was soiled with clay and perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 14]: A streak of blood had run from a slight cut over an eyebrow .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 31]: But the white scar of an old saber wound , the outcome of a duelling bout in some university _ burschenschaft _ , creased down its center when he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 4]: Then Martin knew .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 5]: `` Fritz Bauer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 11]: The German started , though he recovered his self-control promptly .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 10]: `` You haf nod unterstant , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 20]: `` I dell you my nem -- '' `` That 's all right , Fritz , '' laughed Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 11]: `` You spoke good English when you were in Elmsdale .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 18]: You could fool me then into giving you valuable information for your precious scheme of invading England .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 6]: Now it 's my turn !
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 7]: Have you forgotten Martin Bolland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 13]: Blank incredulity yielded to evident fear in the other man 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 7]: With obvious effort , he stiffened .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 14]: `` I was acting under orders , Captain Bolland , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 11]: `` Not Bolland , but Grant , '' laughed Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 18]: `` I , too , have changed my name , but for a more honorable reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 8]: The words seemed to irritate von Struben .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 10]: `` I did noding dishonorable , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 7]: `` I was dere by command .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 25]: If it was n't for your d -- d fleet , I would have lodged once more in de Elms eighdeen monds ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 8]: `` I know , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 29]: `` We found your map , the map which Ang√®le stole because you would n't take her in the car the day we went on the moor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 11]: In all likelihood the prisoner 's nerves were on edge .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 43]: He had gone through a good deal since being hauled into the shell hole , and was by no means prepared for this display of intimate knowledge of his past career by the youthful looking Briton who had manhandled him so effectually .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 23]: Be that as it may , he was so disconcerted by the mere allusion to Ang√®le that a fantastic notion gripped Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 6]: He pursued it at once .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 35]: `` We English are not quite such idiots as you like to imagine us , major , '' he went on , and so ready was his speech that the pause was hardly perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 27]: `` Mrs. Saumarez -- or , describing her by her other name , the Baroness von Edelstein -- was a far more dangerous person than you .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 15]: It took time to run her to earth -- you know what that means ?
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 23]: when a fox is chased to a burrow by hounds -- but our Intelligence Department sized her up correctly at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 34]: Now this was nothing more than the wildest guessing , a product of many a long talk with Elsie , the vicar , and General Grant during the early days of the war .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 20]: But von Struben was manifestly so ill at ease that he had to cover his discomfiture under a frown .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 15]: `` I have not seen de lady for ten years , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 5]: This disclaimer was needless .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 13]: He had been wiser to have cursed Ang√®le for purloining his map .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 4]: `` Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 4]: She avoided Berlin .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 8]: But you have heard of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 9]: Again was the former spy guilty of stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 9]: He set his lips like a steel trap .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 9]: Doubtful what to say , he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 6]: Martin nodded to Sergeant Mason .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 13]: `` Just go through the major 's pockets , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 8]: `` You know what we want . ''
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 6]: Mason 's knowledge was precise .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 14]: He left the prisoner his money , watch , pipe , and handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 12]: The remainder of his belongings were made up into a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 35]: Highly valuable treasure-trove was contained therein , the major having in his possession a detailed list of all arms in the Fifty-seventh Brandenburg Division and a sketch of the trench system which it occupied .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 13]: A glance showed Martin that the Fifty-seventh Division lay directly in front .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 20]: He turned to the subaltern whose dugout he was using and who had witnessed the foregoing scene in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 17]: `` Can you send a corporal 's guard to D.H.Q. in charge of the prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 8]: `` Certainly , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 13]: `` By the way , come outside and have a cigarette . ''
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 29]: Cigarettes are not lighted in front-line communication trenches after nightfall -- not by officers , at any rate -- nor do second lieutenants address staff captains so flippantly .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 13]: Martin read something more into the invitation than appeared on the surface .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 26]: `` About this Mrs. Saumarez you spoke of just now , '' said the subaltern when they were beyond the closed door of the dugout .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 16]: `` Is she the widow of one of our fellows , a Hussar colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 11]: `` Do you know she is living in Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 16]: `` Well , I heard some few years since that she was residing there . ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 6]: `` She 's there now .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 12]: She runs a sort of hostel for youngsters on short leave .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 13]: She 's supposed to charge a small fee , but does n't .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 9]: And there 's drinks galore for all comers .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 20]: She 's extraordinarily popular , of course , but I -- er -- well , one hates saying it .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 17]: Still , you made me sit up and take notice when you mentioned the Intelligence Department .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 11]: Mrs. Saumarez has a wonderful acquaintance with the British front .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 25]: She tells you things -- do n't you know -- and one is led on to talk -- sort of reciprocity , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 6]: Martin drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 8]: He almost dreaded putting the inevitable question .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 16]: `` Is her daughter with her -- a girl of twenty-one , named Ang√®le ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 11]: Never heard Mrs. Saumarez so much as mention her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 3]: `` Thanks .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 12]: We 've done a good night 's work , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 16]: And -- this for yourself only -- there may be a scrap to-morrow afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 3]: `` Fine !
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 7]: I want to stretch my legs .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 8]: Been in this bally hole nine days .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 7]: Well , here 's your corporal .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 5]: Good-night , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 4]: `` Good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 16]: And Martin trudged through the mud with Sergeant Mason behind von Struben and the escort .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 40]: CHAPTER XXI NEARING THE END Sixty hours elapsed before Martin was able to unwrap the puttees from off his stiff legs and cut the laces of boots so caked with mud that he was too weary to untie them .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 52]: In that time , as the official report put it , `` enemy trenches extending from Rue du Bois to Houplines , over a front of nearly three miles , were occupied to an average depth of one thousand yards , and our troops are now consolidating the new territory . ''
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 6]: A bald announcement , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 13]: Martin was one of the few who knew what it really meant .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 15]: He had helped to organize the victory ; he could sum up its costs .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 22]: But this record is not a history of the war , nor even of one young soldier 's share in it .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 13]: Martin himself has developed a literary style noteworthy for its simple directness .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 14]: Some day , if he survives , he may tell his own story .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 72]: When the last of twelve hundred prisoners had been mustered in the Grande Place of Armenti√®res , when the attacking battalions had been relieved and the reserve artillery was shelling Fritz 's hastily formed gun positions , when the last ambulance wagon of the `` special '' division had sped over the _ pav√© _ to the base hospital at Bailleul , Martin thought he was free to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 10]: As a matter of fact , he was not .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 45]: Utterly spent , he had thrown himself on a cot and had slept the sleep of complete exhaustion for half an hour , when a brigade major discovered that `` Captain Grant '' was at liberty , and detailed him for an immediate inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 19]: The facts were set forth on Army Form 122 : `` On the night of the 10th inst .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 17]: a barrel of rum , delivered at Brigade Dump No. 35 , was stolen or mislaid .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 8]: It was last seen in trench 77 .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 10]: For investigation and report to D.A.Q.M.G. 50th Div . ''
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 28]: That barrel of rum will never be seen again , though it was destined to roll through reams of variously numbered army forms during many a week .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 9]: But it did not disturb Martin 's slumbers .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 13]: A brigadier general happened to hear his name given to an orderly .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 6]: `` Who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 4]: he inquired sharply .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 8]: `` Grant , did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , '' answered the brigade major .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 10]: `` Do n't be such a Heaven-condemned idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 15]: said the general , or , rather , he used words to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 8]: `` Grant was all through that push .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 6]: Find some other fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 6]: Brigade majors are necessarily inhuman .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 20]: It is nothing to them what a man may have done -- they think only of the next job .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 9]: They are steeled alike to pity and reproach .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 9]: This one was no exception among the tribe .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 20]: He merely thumbed a list and said to the orderly : `` Give that chit to Mr. Fortescue . ''
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 7]: So a subaltern began the chase .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 25]: He smelt the rum through a whole company of Gordons , but the barrel lies hid a fathom deep in the mud of Flanders .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 13]: That same afternoon Martin woke up , refreshed in mind and body .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 44]: He secured a hot bath , `` dolled up '' in clean clothes , and strolled out to buy some socks from `` Madame , '' the famous Frenchwoman who has kept her shop open in Armenti√®res throughout three years of shell fire .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 25]: A Yorkshire battalion was `` standing at ease '' in the street while their officers and color sergeants engaged in a wrangle about billets .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 32]: The regiment had taken part in the `` push '' and bore the outward and visible signs of that inward grace which had carried them beyond the third line German trench .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 12]: A lance corporal was playing `` Tipperary '' on a mouth-organ .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 28]: Someone shouted : `` Give us ` Home Fires , ' Jim '' -- and `` Jim '' ran a preliminary flourish before Martin recognized the musician .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 11]: `` Why , if it is n't Jim Bates ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 8]: he cried , advancing with outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 9]: The lance corporal drew himself up and saluted .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 31]: His brown skin reddened as he shook hands , for it is not every day that a staff captain greets one of the rank and file in such democratic fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 15]: `` I 'm main glad te see you , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 26]: `` I read of your promotion in t ' _ Messenger _ , an ' we boys of t ' owd spot were real pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 8]: We were , an ' all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 29]: `` You 're keeping fit , I see , '' and Martin 's eye fell to a _ pickelhaube _ tied to the sling of Bates 's rifle .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 10]: `` Pretty well , sir , '' grinned Bates .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 13]: `` I nearly had a relapse yesterday when that mine went up .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 7]: Did ye hear of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 21]: `` If you mean the one they touched off at L'Epinette Farm , I saw it , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 11]: `` I was at the crossroads at the moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 8]: `` Well , fancy that , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 12]: I could n't ha ' bin twenty yards from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 7]: `` Queer things happen in war .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 16]: Do you remember Mrs. Saumarez 's German chauffeur , a man named Fritz Bauer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 7]: `` Quite well , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 15]: `` We caught him in ` No Man 's Land ' three nights ago .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 7]: He is a major now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 19]: Jim was so astonished that his mouth opened , just as it would have done ten years earlier .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 5]: `` By gum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 5]: `` That takes it !
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 16]: An ' it 's hardly a month since I saw Miss Ang√®le in Amiens . ''
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 5]: Martin 's pulse quickened .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 27]: The mouth-organ in Bates 's hand brought him back at a bound to the night when he had forbidden Jim to play for Ang√®le 's dancing .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 8]: And with that memory came another thought .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 21]: Mrs. Saumarez in Paris -- her daughter in Amiens -- why this devotion to such nerve centers of the war ?
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 7]: `` You would hardly recognize her .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 14]: She is ten years older -- a woman , not a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 3]: Bates laughed .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 5]: He dropped his voice .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 10]: `` She was always a bit owd-fashioned , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 5]: I 'm not mistakken .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 6]: It kem about this way .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 7]: It was her , right enough .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 17]: Our colonel 's shover fell sick , so I took on the car for a week .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 29]: One day I was waitin ' outside the Hotel dew Nord at Amiens when a French Red Cross auto drove up , an ' out stepped Miss Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 6]: I twigged her at once .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 9]: I 'd know them eyes of hers anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 12]: She hopped into the hotel , walkin ' like a ballet-dancer .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 25]: Hooiver , I goes up to her shover an ' sez : ` Pardonnay moy , but ai n't that Mees Ang√®le Saumarez ? '
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 19]: He talked a lot -- these Frenchies always do -- but I med out he did n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 15]: So I parlay-vooed some more , and soon I got the hang of things .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 19]: She 's married now , an ' I have her new name an ' address in my kit-bag .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 8]: But I remember 'em , all right .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 13]: I ca n't pronounce 'em , but I can spell 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 25]: And Lance Corporal Bates spelled : `` La Comtesse Barth√©lemi de Saint-Ivoy , 2 bis , Impasse Fautet , Rue Blanche , Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 23]: `` It looks funny , '' went on Jim anxiously , `` but it 's just as her shover wrote it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 8]: Martin affected to treat this information lightly .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 14]: `` I 'm exceedingly glad I came across you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 13]: `` How would you like to be a sergeant , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 4]: Bates grinned widely .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 21]: `` It 's a lot more work , but it does mean better grub , sir , '' he confided .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 16]: Do n't mention it to anyone , and I 'll see what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 16]: It should n't be difficult , since you 've earned the first stripe already . ''
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 8]: Martin found his brigadier at the mess .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 22]: A few minutes ' conversation with the great man led him to a greater in the person of the divisional general .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 30]: Yet a few more minutes of earnest talk , and he was in a car , bound for General Grant 's headquarters , which he reached late that night .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 30]: It was long after midnight when the two retired , and the son 's face was almost as worn and care-lined as the father 's ere the discussion ended .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 22]: Few problems have been so baffling and none more dangerous to the Allied armies in France than the German spy system .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 41]: It was so perfect before the war , every possible combination of circumstances had been foreseen and provided against so fully , that the most thorough hunting out and ruthless punishment of enemy agents has failed to crush the organization .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 10]: The snake has been scotched , but not killed .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 6]: Its venom is still potent .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 30]: Every officer on the staff and many senior regimental officers have been astounded time and again by the completeness and up-to-date nature of the information possessed by the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 21]: Surprise attacks planned with the utmost secrecy have found enemy trenches held by packed reserves and swarming with additional machine-guns .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 21]: Newly established ammunition d√©p√¥ts , carefully screened , have been bombed next day by aeroplanes and subjected to high-angle fire .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 16]: Troop movements by rail over long distances have become known , and their effect discounted .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 27]: Flanders , in particular , is a plague-spot of espionage which has cost Britain an untold sacrifice of life and an almost immeasurable waste of effort .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 15]: Small wonder , then , that Martin 's forehead should be seamed with foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 38]: If his suspicions , which his father shared , were justified , the French Intelligence Department would quickly determine the truth , and no power on earth could save Ang√®le and her mother from a firing party .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 10]: France knows her peril and stamps it out unflinchingly .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 14]: Of late , too , the British authorities adopt the same rigorous measures .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 12]: The spy , man or woman , is shown no mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 24]: And now the whirligig of events had placed in Martin 's hands the question of life or death for Mrs. Saumarez and Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 6]: It was a loathsome burden .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 5]: He rebelled against it .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 21]: During the long run to Paris his very soul writhed at the thought that fate was making him their executioner .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 57]: He tried to steel his resolution by dwelling on the mischief they might have caused by thinking rather of the gallant comrades laid forever in the soil of France because of their murderous duplicity than of the woman who was once his friend , of the girl whose kisses had once thrilled him to the core .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 34]: Worst of all , both General Grant and he himself felt some measure of responsibility for their failure to institute a searching inquiry as to Mrs. Saumarez 's whereabouts when war broke out .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 7]: But he was distraught and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 46]: He had a notion -- a well-founded one , as it transpired -- that an approving general had recommended him for the Military Cross ; but from all appearance he might have expected a letter from the War Office announcing his dismissal from the service .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 45]: At last , after a struggle which left him so broken that at a cordon near Paris he was detained several minutes while a _ sous-officier _ who did not like his looks communicated with a superior potentate , he made up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 13]: Whate'er befell , he would give Ang√®le and her mother one chance .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 11]: If they decided to take it , well and good .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 14]: If not , they must face the cold-eyed inquisition of the Quai d'Orsay .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 16]: Luckily , as matters turned out , he elected to call on Mrs. Saumarez first .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 43]: For one thing , her house in the Rue Henri was not far from a hotel on the Champs Elys√©es where he was known to the management ; for another , he wished to run no risk of being outwitted by Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 38]: If she and her mother were guilty of the ineffable infamy of betraying both the country of their nationality and that which sheltered them they must be trapped so effectually as to leave no room for doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 28]: He was also fortunate in the fact that his soldier chauffeur , when given the choice , decided to wait and drive him to the Rue Henri .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 13]: The man was candid as to his own plans for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 24]: `` When I put the car up I 'll have a hot bath and go to bed , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 36]: `` I 've not had five hours ' sleep straight on end during the past three weeks , an ' I know wot 'll happen if I start hittin ' it up around these bullyvards .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 8]: Me for the feathers at nine o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 18]: So , if you do n't mind , sir -- '' Martin knew what the man meant .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 7]: He wanted to be kept busy .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 14]: One hour of enforced liberty implied the risk of meeting some hilarious comrades .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 32]: Even in Paris , strict as the police regulations may be , Britons from the front are able to sit up late , and the parties are seldom `` dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 30]: So officer and man removed some of the marks of a long journey , ate a good meal , and about eight o'clock arrived at Mrs. Saumarez 's house .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 18]: Life might be convivial enough inside , but the place looked deserted , almost forbidding , externally .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 32]: Indeed , Martin hesitated before pressing an electric bell and consulted a notebook to verify the street and number given him by the subaltern on the night von Struben was captured .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 6]: But he had not erred .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 5]: His memory never failed .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 39]: There could be no doubt but that his special gift in this direction had been responsible for a rapid promotion , since military training , on the mental side , depends largely on a letter-perfect accuracy of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 12]: When he rang , however , the door opened at once .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 34]: A bareheaded man in civilian attire , but looking most unlike a domestic , held aside a pair of heavy curtains which shut out the least ray of light from the hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 25]: _ Entrez , monsieur _ , '' he said in reply to Martin , after a sharp glance at the car and its driver .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 8]: Martin heard a latch click behind him .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 17]: He passed on , to find himself before a sergeant of police seated at a table .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 5]: Three policemen stood near .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 9]: `` Your name and rank , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 4]: said this official .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 15]: Martin , though surprised , almost startled , by these preliminaries , answered promptly .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 9]: The sergeant nodded to one of his aides .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 10]: `` Take this gentleman upstairs , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 7]: `` Is there any mistake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 3]: inquired Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 11]: `` I have come here to visit Mrs. Saumarez . ''
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 9]: `` No mistake , '' said the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 8]: `` Follow that man , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 27]: Assured now that some dramatic and wholly unexpected development had taken place , Martin tried to gather his wits as he mounted to the first floor .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 28]: There , in a shuttered drawing-room , he confronted a shrewd-looking man in mufti , to whom his guide handed a written slip sent by the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 10]: Evidently , this was an official of some importance .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 10]: `` Shall I speak English , Captain Grant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 22]: he said , thrusting aside a pile of documents and clearing a space on the table at which he was busy .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 22]: `` Well , '' said Martin , smiling , `` I imagine that your English is better than my French . ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 10]: He sat on a chair indicated by the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 5]: He put no questions .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 11]: He guessed he was in the presence of a tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 10]: `` Is Mrs. Saumarez a friend of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 4]: began the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 8]: `` Yes , in a sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 8]: `` Have you seen her recently ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 7]: `` Not for ten years . ''
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 7]: Obviously , this answer was disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 27]: It was evident , too , that Martin 's name was not on a typed list which the other man had scanned with a quick eye .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 9]: Martin determined to clear up an involved situation .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 14]: `` I take it that you are connected with the police department ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 25]: `` Well , I have come from the British front at Armenti√®res to inquire into the uses to which this house has been put .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 10]: A number of British officers have been entertained here .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 8]: Our people want to know why . ''
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 20]: He left it at that for the time being , but the Frenchman 's manner became perceptibly more friendly .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 8]: `` May I examine your papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 31]: Martin handed over the bundle of `` permis de voyage , '' which everyone without exception must possess in order to move about the roads of western France in wartime .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 20]: said the official , his air changing now to one of marked relief , `` this helps matters greatly .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 11]: My name is Duchesne , Captain Grant -- Gustave Duchesne .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 8]: I belong to the Bureau de l'Int√©rieur .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 9]: So you people also have had your suspicions ?
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 20]: There can be no doubt about it -- the Baroness von Edelstein was a spy of the worst kind .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 8]: The mischief that woman did was incalculable .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 26]: Of course , it was hopeless to look for any real preventive work in England before the war ; but we were caught napping here .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 30]: You see , the widow of a British officer , a lady who had the best of credentials , and whose means were ample , hardly came under review .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 20]: She kept open house , and had lived in Paris so long that her German origin was completely forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 12]: In fact , the merest accident brought about her downfall . ''
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 16]: One of the policemen came in with a written memorandum , which M. Duchesne read .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 14]: `` Your chauffeur does not give information willingly , '' smiled the latter .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 18]: `` The sergeant had to threaten him with arrest before he would describe your journey to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 20]: It was clear that the authorities were taking nothing for granted where Mrs. Saumarez and her visitors were concerned .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 13]: Martin felt that he had stumbled to the lip of an abyss .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 21]: At any rate , events were out of his hands now , and for that dispensation he was profoundly thankful .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 19]: `` I think I ought to tell you what I know of Mrs. Saumarez , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 33]: `` I do n't wish to do the unfortunate woman an injustice , and my facts are so nebulous -- '' `` One moment , Captain Grant , '' interposed the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 17]: `` You may feel less constraint if you hear that the Baroness died this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 5]: `` Good Heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 6]: was Martin 's involuntary cry .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 6]: `` Was she executed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 8]: `` No , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 10]: `` She forestalled justice by a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 8]: The cause of death was heart failure .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 5]: She was -- intemperate .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 10]: Her daughter was with her at the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 7]: `` Madame Barth√©lemi de Saint-Ivoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 8]: `` You know her , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 16]: `` I met her in a Yorkshire village at the same time as her mother .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 30]: The other day , by chance , I ascertained her name and address from one of our village lads who recognized her in Amiens about a month ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 22]: `` Well , you were about to say -- '' Martin had to put forth a physical effort to regain self-control .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 12]: He plunged at once into the story of those early years .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 13]: There was little to tell with regard to Mrs. Saumarez and Ang√®le .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 24]: `` Fritz Bauer '' was the chief personage , and he was now well on his way to a prison camp in England .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 13]: Monsieur Duchesne was amused by the map episode in its latest phase .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 13]: `` And you were so blind that you took no action ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 4]: he commented dryly .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 8]: We saw , but were invincibly confident .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 28]: My father sent the map to the Intelligence Department , with which he was connected until 1912 , when he was given a command in the North .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 20]: He and I believe now that someone in Whitehall overlooked the connection between Mrs. Saumarez and an admitted spy .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 18]: She had left England , and there was so much to do when war broke out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 11]: If only those people in London had written us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 9]: `` Is the affair really so bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 3]: `` Bad !
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 10]: This wretched creature showed an ingenuity that was devilish .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 6]: She deceived her own daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 5]: That is perfectly clear .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 38]: The girl married a French officer after the Battle of the Marne , and , as we have every reason to believe , thought she had persuaded her mother to break off relations with her German friends .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 27]: We know now that the baroness , left to her own devices , adopted a method of conveying information to the Boches which almost defied detection .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 28]: Owing to her knowledge of the British army she was able to chat with your men on a plane of intimacy which no ordinary woman could command .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 14]: She found out where certain brigades were stationed and what regiments composed them .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 9]: She heard to what extent battalions were decimated .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 20]: She knew what types of guns were in use and what improvements were coming along in caliber and range .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 17]: She was told when men were suddenly recalled from leave , and where they were going .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 15]: Need I say what deductions the German Staff could make from such facts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 18]: `` But how on earth could she convey the information in time to be of value ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 4]: `` Quite easily .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 15]: There is one weak spot on our frontier -- south of the German line .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 19]: She wrote to an agent in Pontarlier , and this man transmitted her notes across the Swiss frontier .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 5]: The rest was simple .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 10]: She was caught by fate , not by us .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 17]: Years ago she employed a woman from Tinchebrai as a nurse -- '' `` Fran√ßoise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 4]: broke in Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 6]: `` Exactly -- Fran√ßoise Dupont .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 8]: Well , Madame Dupont died in 1913 .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 25]: But she had spoken of her former mistress to a nephew , and this man , a cripple , is now a Paris postman .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 22]: He is a sharp-witted peasant , and , as he grew in experience , was promoted gradually to more important districts .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 26]: Just a week ago he took on this very street , and when he saw the name recalled her aunt 's statements about Mrs. Saumarez .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 7]: He informed the S√ªret√© at once .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 8]: Even then she gave us some trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 17]: Her letters were printed , not written , and she could post them in out-of-the-way places .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 9]: However , we trapped her within forty-eight hours .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 21]: Have you a battery of four 9.2 's hidden in a wood three hundred meters north-west of Pont Ballot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 8]: Martin was so flabbergasted that he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 20]: `` That -- is the sort of thing -- we do n't discuss -- anywhere , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 3]: `` Naturally .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 21]: It happens to be also the sort of thing which Mrs. Saumarez drew out of some too-talkative lieutenant of artillery .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 10]: Luckily , the fact has not crossed the border .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 28]: We have the lady 's notepaper and her secret signs , so are taking the liberty to supply the Boches with intelligence more useful to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 11]: `` Then you have n't grabbed the Pontarlier man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 6]: We give him ten days .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 5]: He has six left .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 19]: When his time is up , the Germans will have discovered that the wire has been tapped . ''
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 6]: Martin forced the next question .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 8]: `` What of Madame de Saint-Ivoy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 7]: `` Her case is under consideration .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 8]: She is working for the Croix Rouge .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 8]: That is why she was in Amiens .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 8]: Her husband has been recalled from Verdun .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 19]: He , by the way , is devoted to her , and she professes to hate all Germans .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 8]: Thus far her record is clean . ''
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 47]: Martin was glad to get out into the night air , though he had a strange notion that the quietude of the darkened Paris streets was unreal -- that the only reality lay yonder where the shells crashed and men burrowed like moles in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 4]: His chauffeur saluted .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 13]: `` Glad to see you , sir , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 10]: `` Those blighters wanted to run me in . ''
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 5]: It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 7]: The police are doing good work .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 6]: Take me to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 11]: I 'll follow your example and go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 6]: Martin 's voice was weary .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 21]: He was grateful to Providence that he had been spared the ordeal which faced him when he entered the city .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 20]: But the strain was heavier than he counted on , and he craved rest , even from tumultuous memories .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 24]: Before retiring , however , he wrote to Elsie -- guardedly , of course -- but in sufficient detail that she should understand .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 29]: Next morning , making an early start , he guided the car up the Rue Blanche , as the north road could be reached by a slight detour .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 17]: He saw the Impasse Fautet , and glanced at the drawn blinds of Num√©ro 2 bis .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 13]: In one of those rooms , he supposed , Ang√®le was lying .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 9]: He had resolved not to seek her out .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 20]: When the war was over , and he and his wife visited Paris , they could inquire for her .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 5]: Was she wholly innocent ?
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 4]: He hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 11]: Somehow , he could not picture her as a spy .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 13]: She was a disturbing influence , but her nature was not mean .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 13]: At any rate , her mother 's death would scare her effectually .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 13]: It was a fine morning , clear , and not too cold .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 20]: His spirits rose as the car sped along a good road , after the suburban traffic was left behind .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 7]: The day 's news was cheering .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 26]: Verdun was safe , the Armenti√®res `` push '' was an admitted gain , and the United States had reached the breaking point with Germany .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 33]: Thank God , all would yet be well , and humanity would arise , blood-stained but triumphant , from the rack of torment on which it had been stretched by Teuton oppression !
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 6]: `` Hit her up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 19]: he said when the car had passed through Crueil , and the next cordon was twenty miles ahead .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 22]: The chauffeur stepped on the gas , and the pleasant panorama of France flew by like a land glimpsed in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 27]: * * * * * Every day in far-off Elmsdale Elsie would walk to the White House , or John and Martha would visit the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 17]: If there was no letter , some crumb of comfort could be drawn from its absence .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 20]: Each morning , in both households , the first haunted glance was at the casualty lists in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 59]: But none ever spoke of that , and Elsie knew what she never told the old couple -- that the thing really to be dreaded was a long white envelope from the War Office , with `` O.H.M.S. '' stamped across it , for the relatives of fallen officers are warned before the last sad item is printed .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 6]: Elsie lived at the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 27]: The Elms was too roomy for herself and her baby boy , another Martin Bolland -- such were the names given him at the christening font .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 29]: So it came to pass that she and the vicar , accompanied by a nurse wheeling a perambulator , came to the White House with Martin 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 42]: And , heinous as were Mrs. Saumarez 's faults , unforgivable though her crime , they grieved for her , since her memory in the village had been , for the most part , one of a gracious and dignified woman .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 9]: Martha wiped her spectacles after reading the letter .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 10]: The word `` hotel '' had a comforting sound .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 26]: `` It must ha ' bin nice for t ' lad te find hisself in a decent bed for a night , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 8]: Then Elsie 's eyes filled with tears .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 15]: `` I only wish I had known he was there , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 6]: `` Why , honey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 28]: `` Because , God help me , on one night , at least , I could have fallen asleep with the consciousness that he was safe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 17]: She averted her face , and her slight , graceful body shook with an uncontrollable emotion .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 24]: The vicar was so taken aback by this unlooked-for distress on Elsie 's part that his lips quivered and he dared not speak .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 15]: But John Bolland 's huge hand rested lightly on the young wife 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 10]: `` Dinnat fret , lass , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 16]: `` I feel it i ' me bones that Martin will come back te us .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 29]: England needs such men , the whole wulld needs 'em , an ' the Lord , in His goodness , will see to it that they 're spared .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 32]: Sometimes , when things are blackest , I liken mesen unto Job ; for Job was a farmer an ' bred stock , an ' he was afflicted more than most .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 35]: An ' then I remember that the Lord blessed the latter end of Job , who died old and full of days ; yet I shall die a broken man if Martin is taken .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 15]: O Lord , my God , in Thee do I put my trust ! ''
