Parsing [sent. 1 len. 41]: Title : The Wings of the Morning Author : Louis Tracy THE WINGS OF THE MORNING by LOUIS TRACY CHAPTER I THE WRECK OF THE _ SIRDAR _ Lady Tozer adjusted her gold-rimmed eye-glasses with an air of dignified aggressiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 11]: She had lived too many years in the Far East .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 12]: In Hong Kong she was known as the `` Mandarin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 11]: Her powers of merciless inquisition suggested torments long drawn out .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 34]: The commander of the _ Sirdar _ , homeward bound from Shanghai , knew that he was about to be stretched on the rack when he took his seat at the saloon table .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 16]: `` Is it true , captain , that we are running into a typhoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 4]: demanded her ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 12]: `` From whom did you learn that , Lady Tozer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 9]: Captain Ross was wary , though somewhat surprised .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 5]: `` From Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 15]: I understood her a moment ago to say that you had told her . ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 4]: `` I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 5]: `` Did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 7]: Some one told me this morning .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 11]: I could n't have guessed it , could I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 16]: Miss Iris Deane 's large blue eyes surveyed him with innocent indifference to strict accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 24]: Incidentally , she had obtained the information from her maid , a nose-tilted coquette who extracted ship 's secrets from a youthful quartermaster .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 15]: `` Well -- er -- I had forgotten , '' explained the tactful sailor .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 6]: `` Is it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 9]: Lady Tozer _ was _ unusually abrupt today .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 30]: But she was annoyed by the assumption that the captain took a mere girl into his confidence and passed over the wife of the ex-Chief Justice of Hong Kong .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 30]: `` Yes , it is , '' said Captain Ross , equally curt , and silently thanking the fates that her ladyship was going home for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 5]: `` How horrible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 7]: she gasped , in unaffected alarm .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 11]: This return to femininity soothed the sailor 's ruffled temper .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 9]: Sir John , her husband , frowned judicially .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 19]: That frown constituted his legal stock-in-trade , yet it passed current for wisdom with the Hong Kong bar .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 7]: `` What evidence have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 17]: `` Do tell us , '' chimed in Iris , delightfully unconscious of interrupting the court .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 13]: `` Did you find out when you squinted at the sun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 4]: The captain smiled .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 18]: `` You are nearer the mark than possibly you imagine , Miss Deane , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 17]: `` When we took our observations yesterday there was a very weird-looking halo around the sun .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 19]: This morning you may have noticed several light squalls and a smooth sea marked occasionally by strong ripples .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 23]: The barometer is falling rapidly , and I expect that , as the day wears , we will encounter a heavy swell .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 33]: If the sky looks wild tonight , and especially if we observe a heavy bank of cloud approaching from the north-west , you see the crockery dancing about the table at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 13]: I am afraid you are not a good sailor , Lady Tozer .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 7]: Are you , Miss Deane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 3]: `` Capital !
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 10]: I should just love to see a real storm .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 24]: Now promise me solemnly that you will take me up into the charthouse when this typhoon is simply tearing things to pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 10]: I do hope it will not be very bad .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 13]: Is there no way in which you can avoid it , captain ?
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 6]: Will it last long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 11]: The politic skipper for once preferred to answer Lady Tozer .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 12]: `` There is no cause for uneasiness , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 30]: `` Of course , typhoons in the China Sea are nasty things while they last , but a ship like the _ Sirdar _ is not troubled by them .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 19]: She will drive through the worst gale she is likely to meet here in less than twelve hours .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 20]: Besides , I alter the course somewhat as soon as I discover our position with regard to its center .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 28]: You see , Miss Deane -- '' And Captain Ross forthwith illustrated on the back of a menu card the spiral shape and progress of a cyclone .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 44]: He so thoroughly mystified the girl by his technical references to northern and southern hemispheres , polar directions , revolving air-currents , external circumferences , and diminished atmospheric pressures , that she was too bewildered to reiterate a desire to visit the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 18]: Then the commander hurriedly excused himself , and the passengers saw no more of him that day .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 10]: But his short scientific lecture achieved a double result .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 18]: It rescued him from a request which he could not possibly grant , and reassured Lady Tozer .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 12]: To the non-nautical mind it is the unknown that is fearful .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 32]: A storm classed as `` periodic , '' whose velocity can be measured , whose duration and direction can be determined beforehand by hours and distances , ceases to be terrifying .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 19]: It becomes an accepted fact , akin to the steam-engine and the electric telegraph , marvelous yet commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 20]: So her ladyship dismissed the topic as of no present interest , and focused Miss Deane through her eye-glasses .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 14]: `` Sir Arthur proposes to come home in June , I understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 8]: Iris was a remarkably healthy young woman .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 8]: A large banana momentarily engaged her attention .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 4]: She nodded affably .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 11]: `` You will stay with relatives until he arrives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 4]: pursued Lady Tozer .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 9]: The banana is a fruit of simple characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 20]: The girl was able to reply , with a touch of careless hauteur in her voice : `` Relatives !
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: We have none -- none whom we specially cultivate , that is .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 27]: I will stop in town a day or two to interview my dressmaker , and then go straight to Helmdale , our place in Yorkshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 8]: `` Surely you have a chaperon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 4]: `` A chaperon !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 28]: My dear Lady Tozer , did my father impress you as one who would permit a fussy and stout old person to make my life miserable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 13]: The acidity of the retort lay in the word `` stout . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 8]: But Iris was not accustomed to cross-examination .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 18]: During a three months ' residence on the island she had learnt how to avoid Lady Tozer .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: Here it was impossible , and the older woman fastened upon her asp-like .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 10]: Miss Iris Deane was a toothsome morsel for gossip .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 69]: Not yet twenty-one , the only daughter of a wealthy baronet who owned a fleet of stately ships -- the _ Sirdar _ amongst them -- a girl who had been mistress of her father 's house since her return from Dresden three years ago -- young , beautiful , rich -- here was a combination for which men thanked a judicious Heaven , whilst women sniffed enviously .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 5]: Business detained Sir Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 12]: A war-cloud over-shadowed the two great divisions of the yellow race .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 24]: He must wait to see how matters developed , but he would not expose Iris to the insidious treachery of a Chinese spring .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 8]: So , with tears , they separated .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 11]: She was confided to the personal charge of Captain Ross .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: At each point of call the company 's agents would be solicitous for her welfare .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 20]: The cable 's telegraphic eye would watch her progress as that of some princely maiden sailing in royal caravel .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 38]: This fair , slender , well-formed girl -- delightfully English in face and figure -- with her fresh , clear complexion , limpid blue eyes , and shining brown hair , was a personage of some importance .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 9]: Lady Tozer knew these things and sighed complacently .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 9]: `` Ah , well , '' she resumed .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 11]: `` Parents had different views when I was a girl .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 23]: But I assume Sir Arthur thinks you should become used to being your own mistress in view of your approaching marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 8]: `` My -- approaching -- marriage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 7]: cried Iris , now genuinely amazed .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 14]: Is it not true that you are going to marry Lord Ventnor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 8]: A passing steward heard the point-blank question .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 8]: It had a curious effect upon him .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 33]: He gazed with fiercely eager eyes at Miss Deane , and so far forgot himself as to permit a dish of water ice to rest against Sir John Tozer 's bald head .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 9]: Iris could not help noting his strange behavior .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 16]: A flash of humor chased away her first angry resentment at Lady Tozer 's interrogatory .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 23]: `` That may be my happy fate , '' she answered gaily , `` but Lord Ventnor has not asked me . ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 13]: `` Every one says in Hong Kong -- '' began her ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 8]: `` Confound you , you stupid rascal !
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 6]: what are you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 4]: shouted Sir John .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 25]: His feeble nerves at last conveyed the information that something more pronounced than a sudden draught affected his scalp ; the ice was melting .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 13]: The incident amused those passengers who sat near enough to observe it .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 16]: But the chief steward , hovering watchful near the captain 's table , darted forward .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 30]: Pale with anger he hissed -- `` Report yourself for duty in the second saloon tonight , '' and he hustled his subordinate away from the judge 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 8]: Miss Deane , mirthfully radiant , rose .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 16]: `` Please do n't punish the man , Mr. Jones , '' she said sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 7]: `` It was a sheer accident .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 6]: He was taken by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 12]: In his place I would have emptied the whole dish . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 5]: The chief steward smirked .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 26]: He did not know exactly what had happened ; nevertheless , great though Sir John Tozer might be , the owner 's daughter was greater .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 32]: `` Certainly , miss , certainly , '' he agreed , adding confidentially : -- `` It _ is _ rather hard on a steward to be sent aft , miss .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 19]: It makes such a difference in the -- er -- the little gratuities given by the passengers . ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 5]: The girl was tactful .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 25]: She smiled comprehension at the official and bent over Sir John , now carefully polishing the back of his skull with a table napkin .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 13]: `` I am sure you will forgive him , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 28]: `` I ca n't say why , but the poor fellow was looking so intently at me that he did not see what he was doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: The ex-Chief Justice was instantly mollified .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 32]: He did not mind the application of ice in that way -- rather liked it , in fact -- probably ice was susceptible to the fire in Miss Deane 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: Lady Tozer was not so easily appeased .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 32]: When Iris left the saloon she inquired tartly : `` How is it , John , that Government makes a shipowner a baronet and a Chief Justice only a knight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 24]: `` That question would provide an interesting subject for debate at the Carlton , my dear , '' he replied with equal asperity .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 23]: Suddenly the passengers still seated experienced a prolonged sinking sensation , as if the vessel had been converted into a gigantic lift .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 19]: They were pressed hard into their chairs , which creaked and tried to swing round on their pivots .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 18]: As the ship yielded stiffly to the sea a whiff of spray dashed through an open port .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 37]: `` There , '' snapped her ladyship , `` I knew we should run into a storm , yet Captain Ross led us to believe -- John , take me to my cabin at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 15]: From the promenade deck the listless groups watched the rapid advance of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 19]: There was mournful speculation upon the _ Sirdar 's _ chances of reaching Singapore before the next evening .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 17]: `` We had two hundred and ninety-eight miles to do at noon , '' said Experience .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 18]: `` If the wind and sea catch us on the port bow the ship will pitch awfully .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 9]: Half the time the screw will be racing .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 23]: I once made this trip in the _ Sumatra _ , and we were struck by a south-east typhoon in this locality .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 16]: How long do you think it was before we dropped anchor in Singapore harbor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 6]: No one hazarded a guess .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 5]: `` Three days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 5]: Experience was solemnly pompous .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 5]: `` Three whole days .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 6]: They were like three years .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 11]: I never want to see another gale like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 16]: A timid lady ventured to say -- `` Perhaps this may not be a typhoon .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 12]: It may only be a little bit of a storm . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: Her sex saved her from a jeer .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 6]: Experience gloomily shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: `` The barometer resists your plea , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 18]: `` I fear there will be a good many empty saddles in the saloon at dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 5]: The lady smiled weakly .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 9]: It was a feeble joke at the best .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 14]: `` You think we are in for a sort of marine steeple-chase ? ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 27]: `` Well , thank Heaven , I had a good lunch , '' sniggered a rosy-faced subaltern , and a ripple of laughter greeted his enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 8]: Iris stood somewhat apart from the speakers .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 14]: The wind had freshened and her hat was tied closely over her ears .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 16]: She leaned against the taffrail , enjoying the cool breeze after hours of sultry heat .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 20]: The sky was cloudless yet , but there was a queer tinge of burnished copper in the all-pervading sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 6]: The sea was coldly blue .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 8]: The life had gone out of it .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 8]: It was no longer inviting and translucent .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 26]: That morning , were such a thing practicable , she would have gladly dived into its crystal depths and disported herself like a frolicsome mermaid .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 11]: Now something akin to repulsion came with the fanciful remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 9]: Long sullen undulations swept noiselessly past the ship .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 54]: Once , after a steady climb up a rolling hill of water , the _ Sirdar _ quickly pecked at the succeeding valley , and the propeller gave a couple of angry flaps on the surface , whilst a tremor ran through the stout iron rails on which the girl 's arms rested .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 6]: The crew were busy too .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 18]: Squads of Lascars raced about , industriously obedient to the short shrill whistling of jemadars and quartermasters .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 35]: Boat lashings were tested and tightened , canvas awnings stretched across the deck forward , ventilator cowls twisted to new angles , and hatches clamped down over the wooden gratings that covered the holds .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 13]: Officers , spotless in white linen , flitted quietly to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 6]: When the watch was changed .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 26]: Iris noted that the `` chief '' appeared in an old blue suit and carried oilskins over his arm as he climbed to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 14]: Nature looked disturbed and fitful , and the ship responded to her mood .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: There was a sense of preparation in the air , of coming ordeal , of restless foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 26]: Chains clanked with a noise the girl never noticed before ; the tramp of hurrying men on the hurricane deck overhead sounded heavy and hollow .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 23]: There was a squeaking of chairs that was abominable when people gathered up books and wraps and staggered ungracefully towards the companion-way .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 20]: Altogether Miss Deane was not wholly pleased with the preliminaries of a typhoon , whatever the realities might be .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 15]: And then , why did gales always spring up at the close of day ?
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 48]: Could they not start after breakfast , rage with furious grandeur during lunch , and die away peacefully at dinner-time , permitting one to sleep in comfort without that straining and groaning of the ship which seemed to imply a sharp attack of rheumatism in every joint ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 26]: Why did that silly old woman allude to her contemplated marriage to Lord Ventnor , retailing the gossip of Hong Kong with such malicious emphasis ?
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 13]: For an instant Iris tried to shake the railing in comic anger .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 5]: She hated Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 15]: She did not want to marry him , or anybody else , just yet .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 14]: Of course her father had hinted approval of his lordship 's obvious intentions .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 4]: Countess of Ventnor !
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 8]: Yes , it was a nice title .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 24]: Still , she wanted another couple of years of careless freedom ; in any event , why should Lady Tozer pry and probe ?
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 15]: And finally , why did the steward -- oh , poor old Sir John !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 15]: What _ would _ have happened if the ice had slid down his neck ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 41]: Thoroughly comforted by this gleeful hypothesis , Miss Deane seized a favorable opportunity to dart across to the starboard side and see if Captain Ross 's `` heavy bank of cloud in the north-west '' had put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 20]: there it was , black , ominous , gigantic , rolling up over the horizon like some monstrous football .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 17]: Around it the sky deepened into purple , fringed with a wide belt of brick red .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 11]: She had never seen such a beginning of a gale .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 20]: From what she had read in books she imagined that only in great deserts were clouds of dust generated .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 19]: There could not be dust in the dense pall now rushing with giant strides across the trembling sea .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 5]: Then what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 8]: Why was it so dark and menacing ?
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 17]: And where was desert of stone and sand to compare with this awful expanse of water ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 13]: What a small dot was this great ship on the visible surface !
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 15]: But the ocean itself extended away beyond there , reaching out to the infinite .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 21]: The dot became a mere speck , undistinguishable beneath a celestial microscope such as the gods might condescend to use .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 10]: Iris shivered and aroused herself with a startled laugh .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 33]: A nice book in a sheltered corner , and perhaps forty winks until tea-time -- surely a much more sensible proceeding than to stand there , idly conjuring up phantoms of affright .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 13]: The lively fanfare of the dinner trumpet failed to fill the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 15]: By this time the _ Sirdar _ was fighting resolutely against a stiff gale .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 20]: But the stress of actual combat was better than the eerie sensation of impending danger during the earlier hours .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 39]: The strong , hearty pulsations of the engines , the regular thrashing of the screw , the steadfast onward plunging of the good ship through racing seas and flying scud , were cheery , confident , and inspiring .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: Miss Deane justified her boast that she was an excellent sailor .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 21]: She smiled delightedly at the ship 's surgeon when he caught her eye through the many gaps in the tables .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 9]: She was alone , so he joined her .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 19]: `` You are a credit to the company -- quite a sea-king 's daughter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 16]: `` Doctor , do you talk to all your lady passengers in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 5]: `` Alas , no !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 13]: Too often I can only be truthful when I am dumb . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 3]: Iris laughed .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 20]: `` If I remain long on this ship I will certainly have my head turned , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 19]: `` I receive nothing but compliments from the captain down to -- to -- `` The doctor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 10]: You come a good second on the list . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 24]: In very truth she was thinking of the ice-carrying steward and his queer start of surprise at the announcement of her rumored engagement .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 5]: The man interested her .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 7]: He looked like a broken-down gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 12]: Her quick eyes traveled around the saloon to discover his whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 6]: She could not see him .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 30]: The chief steward stood near , balancing himself in apparent defiance of the laws of gravitation , for the ship was now pitching and rolling with a mad zeal .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 23]: For an instant she meant to inquire what had become of the transgressor , but she dismissed the thought at its inception .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: The matter was too trivial .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 20]: With a wild swoop all the plates , glasses , and cutlery on the saloon tables crashed to starboard .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 18]: Were it not for the restraint of the fiddles everything must have been swept to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 8]: There were one or two minor accidents .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 16]: A steward , taken unawares , was thrown headlong on top of his laden tray .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 14]: Others were compelled to clutch the backs of chairs and cling to pillars .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 20]: One man involuntarily seized the hair of a lady who devoted an hour before each meal to her coiffure .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 16]: The _ Sirdar _ , with a frenzied bound , tried to turn a somersault .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 11]: `` A change of course , '' observed the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 23]: `` They generally try to avoid it when people are in the saloon , but a typhoon admits of no labored politeness .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 20]: As its center is now right ahead we are going on the starboard tack to get behind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 15]: `` I must hurry up and go on deck , '' said Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 15]: `` You will not be able to go on deck until the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 6]: She turned on him impetuously .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 5]: `` Indeed I will .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 17]: Captain Ross promised me -- that is , I asked him -- '' The doctor smiled .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 6]: She was so charmingly insistent .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 10]: `` It is simply impossible , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 7]: `` The companion doors are bolted .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 11]: The promenade deck is swept by heavy seas every minute .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 14]: A boat has been carried away and several stanchions snapped off like carrots .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 17]: For the first time in your life , Miss Deane , you are battened down . ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 9]: The girl 's face must have paled somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 19]: He added hastily , `` There is no danger , you know , but these precautions are necessary .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 22]: You would not like to see several tons of water rushing down the saloon stairs ; now , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 5]: `` Decidedly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 22]: Then after a pause , `` It is not pleasant to be fastened up in a great iron box , doctor .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: It reminds one of a huge coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 10]: The _ Sirdar _ is the safest ship afloat .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 12]: Your father has always pursued a splendid policy in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 24]: The London and Hong Kong Company may not possess fast vessels , but they are seaworthy and well found in every respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 10]: `` Are there many people ill on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 11]: `` No ; just the usual number of disturbed livers .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 10]: We had a nasty accident shortly before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 4]: What happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 10]: `` Some Lascars were caught by a sea forward .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: One man had his leg broken . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 4]: The doctor hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 10]: He became interested in the color of some Burgundy .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 13]: `` I hardly know the exact details yet , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 13]: `` Tomorrow after breakfast I will tell you all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 22]: An English quartermaster and four Lascars had been licked from off the forecastle by the greedy tongue of a huge wave .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 12]: The succeeding surge flung the five men back against the quarter .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 17]: One of the black sailors was pitched aboard , with a fractured leg and other injuries .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 11]: The others were smashed against the iron hull and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 8]: For one tremulous moment the engines slowed .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 13]: The ship commenced to veer off into the path of the cyclone .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 17]: Captain Ross set his teeth , and the telegraph bell jangled `` Full speed ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 5]: `` Poor Jackson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 7]: `` One of my best men .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 22]: I remember seeing his wife , a pretty little woman , and two children coming to meet him last homeward trip .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 6]: They will be there again .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 3]: Good God !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 20]: That Lascar who was saved has some one to await him in a Bombay village , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 10]: The gale sang a mad requiem to its victims .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 9]: The very surface was torn from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 22]: The ship drove relentlessly through sheets of spray that caused the officers high up on the bridge to gasp for breath .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 18]: They held on by main force , though protected by strong canvas sheets bound to the rails .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 7]: The main deck was quite impassable .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 44]: The promenade deck , even the lofty spar deck , was scourged with the broken crests of waves that tried with demoniac energy to smash in the starboard bow , for the _ Sirdar _ was cutting into the heart of the cyclone .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 9]: The captain fought his way to the charthouse .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 15]: He wiped the salt water from his eyes and looked anxiously at the barometer .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 5]: `` Still falling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 17]: `` I will keep on until seven o'clock and then bear three points to the southward .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 9]: By midnight we should be behind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 8]: He struggled back into the outside fury .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 16]: By comparison the sturdy citadel he quitted was Paradise on the edge of an inferno .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 22]: Down in the saloon the hardier passengers were striving to subdue the ennui of an interval before they sought their cabins .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: Some talked .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 7]: One hardened reprobate strummed the piano .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 14]: Others played cards , chess , draughts , anything that would distract attention .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 12]: The stately apartment offered strange contrast to the warring elements without .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 41]: Bright lights , costly upholstery , soft carpets , carved panels and gilded cornices , with uniformed attendants passing to and fro carrying coffee and glasses -- these surroundings suggested a floating palace in which the raging seas were defied .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 31]: Yet forty miles away , somewhere in the furious depths , four corpses swirled about with horrible uncertainty , lurching through battling currents , and perchance convoyed by fighting sharks .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 7]: The surgeon had been called away .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 10]: Iris was the only lady left in the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 20]: She watched a set of whist players for a time and then essayed the perilous passage to her stateroom .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 9]: She found her maid and a stewardess there .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 5]: Both women were weeping .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: The stewardess tried to speak .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: She choked with grief and hastily went out .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: The maid blubbered an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 18]: `` A friend of hers was married , miss , to the man who is drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 3]: `` Drowned !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 4]: What man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 8]: `` Have n't you heard , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 8]: I suppose they are keeping it quiet .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 15]: An English sailor and some natives were swept off the ship by a sea .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 12]: One native was saved , but he is all smashed up .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 8]: The others were never seen again . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 12]: Iris by degrees learnt the sad chronicles of the Jackson family .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 6]: She was moved to tears .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 19]: She remembered the doctor 's hesitancy , and her own idle phrase -- `` a huge coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 10]: Outside the roaring waves pounded upon the iron walls .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 5]: Were they not satiated ?
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 12]: This tragedy had taken all the grandeur out of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 22]: It was no longer a majestic phase of nature 's power , but an implacable demon , bellowing for a sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 36]: And that poor woman , with her two children , hopefully scanning the shipping lists for news of the great steamer , news which , to her , meant only the safety of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 6]: Oh , it was pitiful !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 6]: Iris would not be undressed .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 14]: The maid sniveled a request to be allowed to remain with her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 9]: She would lie on a couch until morning .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 15]: Two staterooms had been converted into one to provide Miss Deane with ample accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 15]: There were no bunks , but a cozy bed was screwed to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 9]: She lay down , and strove to read .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 6]: It was a difficult task .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 20]: Her eyes wandered from the printed page to mark the absurd antics of her garments swinging on their hooks .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 16]: At times the ship rolled so far that she felt sure it must topple over .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 17]: She was not afraid ; but subdued , rather astonished , placidly prepared for vague eventualities .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 45]: Through it all she wondered why she clung to the belief that in another day or two the storm would be forgotten , and people playing quoits on deck , dancing , singing coon songs in the music-room , or grumbling at the heat .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 4]: Things were ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 10]: What need was there for all this external fury ?
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 15]: Why should poor sailors be cast forth to instant death in such awful manner ?
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 22]: If she could only sleep and forget -- if kind oblivion would blot out the storm for a few blissful hours !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 24]: But how could one sleep with the consciousness of that watery giant thundering his summons upon the iron plates a few inches away ?
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 20]: Then came the blurred picture of Captain Ross high up on the bridge , peering into the moving blackness .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 28]: How strange that there should be hidden in the convolutions of a man 's brain an intelligence that laid bare the pretences of that ravenous demon without .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 29]: Each of the ship 's officers , the commander more than the others , understood the why and the wherefore of this blustering combination of wind and sea .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 7]: Iris knew the language of poker .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 8]: Nature was putting up a huge bluff .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 11]: What was it the captain said in his little lecture ?
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 52]: `` When a ship meets a cyclone north of the equator on a westerly course she nearly always has the wind at first on the port side , but , owing to the revolution of the gale , when she passes its center the wind is on the starboard side . ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 15]: Yes , that was right , as far as the first part was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 10]: Evidently they had not yet passed the central path .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 5]: She was so tired .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 19]: It demanded a physical effort to constantly shove away an unseen force that tried to push you over .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 13]: How funny that a big cloud should travel up against the wind !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 34]: And so , amidst confused wonderment , she lapsed into an uneasy slumber , her last sentient thought being a quiet thankfulness that the screw went thud-thud , thud-thud with such firm determination .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 24]: After the course was changed and the _ Sirdar _ bore away towards the south-west , the commander consulted the barometer each half-hour .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 12]: The tell-tale mercury had sunk over two inches in twelve hours .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 17]: The abnormally low pressure quickly created dense clouds which enhanced the melancholy darkness of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 13]: For many minutes together the bows of the ship were not visible .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 10]: Masthead and sidelights were obscured by the pelting scud .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 16]: The engines thrust the vessel forward like a lance into the vitals of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 12]: Wind and wave gushed out of the vortex with impotent fury .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 15]: At last , soon after midnight , the barometer showed a slight upward movement .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 19]: At 1.30 a.m. the change became pronounced ; simultaneously the wind swung round a point to the westward .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 6]: Then Captain Ross smiled wearily .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 4]: His face brightened .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: He opened his oilskin coat , glanced at the compass , and nodded approval .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 15]: `` That 's right , '' he shouted to the quartermaster at the steam-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 11]: `` Keep her steady there , south 15 west . ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 43]: `` South 15 west it is , sir , '' yelled the sailor , impassively watching the moving disk , for the wind alteration necessitated a little less help from the rudder to keep the ship 's head true to her course .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 13]: Captain Ross ate some sandwiches and washed them down with cold tea .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 15]: He was more hungry than he imagined , having spent eleven hours without food .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 5]: The tea was insipid .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 15]: He called through a speaking-tube for a further supply of sandwiches and some coffee .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 8]: Then he turned to consult a chart .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 8]: He was joined by the chief officer .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 8]: Both men examined the chart in silence .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 7]: Captain Ross finally took a pencil .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 28]: He stabbed its point on the paper in the neighborhood of 14 ° N. and 112 ° E. `` We are about there , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 4]: The chief agreed .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 12]: `` That was the locality I had in my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 7]: He bent closer over the sheet .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: `` Nothing in the way tonight , sir , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 4]: `` Nothing whatever .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 13]: It is a bit of good luck to meet such weather here .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 27]: We can keep as far south as we like until daybreak , and by that time -- How did it look when you came in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: `` A trifle better , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 8]: `` I have sent for some refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 26]: Let us have another _ dekko _ -LSB- Footnote : Hindustani for `` look '' -- word much used by sailors in the East . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 6]: before we tackle them . ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 9]: The two officers passed out into the hurricane .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 13]: Instantly the wind endeavored to tear the charthouse from off the deck .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 6]: They looked aloft and ahead .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 11]: The officer on duty saw them and nodded silent comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 8]: It was useless to attempt to speak .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 6]: The weather was perceptibly clearer .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 7]: Then all three peered ahead again .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 16]: They stood , pressing against the wind , seeking to penetrate the murkiness in front .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 8]: Suddenly they were galvanized into strenuous activity .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: A wild howl came from the lookout forward .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 28]: The eyes of the three men glared at a huge dismasted Chinese junk , wallowing helplessly in the trough of the sea , dead under the bows .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 20]: The captain sprang to the charthouse and signaled in fierce pantomime that the wheel should be put hard over .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 51]: The officer in charge of the bridge pressed the telegraph lever to `` stop '' and `` full speed astern , '' whilst with his disengaged hand he pulled hard at the siren cord , and a raucous warning sent stewards flying through the ship to close collision bulkhead doors .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 34]: The `` chief '' darted to the port rail , for the _ Sirdar 's _ instant response to the helm seemed to clear her nose from the junk as if by magic .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 24]: It all happened so quickly that whilst the hoarse signal was still vibrating through the ship , the junk swept past her quarter .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 17]: The chief officer , joined now by the commander , looked down into the wretched craft .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 17]: They could see her crew lashed in a bunch around the capstan on her elevated poop .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 6]: She was laden with timber .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 12]: Although water-logged , she could not sink if she held together .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 18]: A great wave sucked her away from the steamer and then hurled her back with irresistible force .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 25]: The _ Sirdar _ was just completing her turning movement , and she heeled over , yielding to the mighty power of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: For an appreciable instant her engines stopped .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 20]: The mass of water that swayed the junk like a cork lifted the great ship high by the stern .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 57]: The propeller began to revolve in air -- for the third officer had corrected his signal to `` full speed ahead '' again -- and the cumbrous Chinese vessel struck the _ Sirdar _ a terrible blow in the counter , smashing off the screw close to the thrust-block and wrenching the rudder from its bearings .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 16]: There was an awful race by the engines before the engineers could shut off steam .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 41]: The junk vanished into the wilderness of noise and tumbling seas beyond , and the fine steamer of a few seconds ago , replete with magnificent energy , struggled like a wounded leviathan in the grasp of a vengeful foe .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 22]: She swung round , as if in wrath , to pursue the puny assailant which had dealt her this mortal stroke .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 18]: No longer breasting the storm with stubborn persistency , she now drifted aimlessly before wind and wave .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 13]: She was merely a larger plaything , tossed about by Titantic gambols .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 9]: The junk was burst asunder by the collision .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 23]: Her planks and cargo littered the waves , were even tossed in derision on to the decks of the _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 24]: Of what avail was strong timber or bolted iron against the spleen of the unchained and formless monster who loudly proclaimed his triumph ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: The great steamship drifted on through chaos .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: The typhoon had broken the lance .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 14]: But brave men , skilfully directed , wrought hard to avert further disaster .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 21]: After the first moment of stupor , gallant British sailors risked life and limb to bring the vessel under control .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 12]: By their calm courage they shamed the paralyzed Lascars into activity .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 26]: A sail was rigged on the foremast , and a sea anchor hastily constructed as soon as it was discovered that the helm was useless .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 39]: Rockets flared up into the sky at regular intervals , in the faint hope that should they attract the attention of another vessel she would follow the disabled _ Sirdar _ and render help when the weather moderated .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 43]: When the captain ascertained that no water was being shipped , the damage being wholly external , the collision doors were opened and the passengers admitted to the saloon , a brilliant palace , superbly indifferent to the wreck and ruin without .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 21]: Captain Ross himself came down and addressed a few comforting words to the quiet men and pallid women gathered there .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 8]: He told them exactly what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 12]: Sir John Tozer , self-possessed and critical , asked a question .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 10]: `` The junk is destroyed , I assume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 5]: `` It is . ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 15]: `` Would it not have been better to have struck her end on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 33]: `` Much better , but that is not the view we should take if we encountered a vessel relatively as big as the _ Sirdar _ was to the unfortunate junk . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 17]: `` But , '' persisted the lawyer , `` what would have been the result ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 16]: `` You would never have known that the incident had happened , Sir John . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 31]: `` In other words , the poor despairing Chinamen , clinging to their little craft with some chance of escape , would be quietly murdered to suit our convenience . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 16]: It was Iris 's clear voice that rang out this downright exposition of the facts .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 13]: Sir John shook his head ; he carried the discussion no further .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 12]: The hours passed in tedious misery after Captain Ross 's visit .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 17]: Every one was eager to get a glimpse of the unknown terrors without from the deck .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 29]: This was out of the question , so people sat around the tables to listen eagerly to Experience and his wise saws on drifting ships and their prospects .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 15]: Some cautious persons visited their cabins to secure valuables in case of further disaster .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: A few hardy spirits returned to bed .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 30]: Meanwhile , in the charthouse , the captain and chief officer were gravely pondering over an open chart , and discussing a fresh risk that loomed ominously before them .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 16]: The ship was a long way out of her usual course when the accident happened .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 72]: She was drifting now , they estimated , eleven knots an hour , with wind , sea , and current all forcing her in the same direction , drifting into one of the most dangerous places in the known world , the south China Sea , with its numberless reefs , shoals , and isolated rocks , and the great island of Borneo stretching right across the path of the cyclone .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 21]: Still , there was nothing to be done save to make a few unobtrusive preparations and trust to idle chance .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 19]: To attempt to anchor and ride out the gale in their present position was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 11]: Two , three , four o'clock came , and went .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 14]: Another half-hour would witness the dawn and a further clearing of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 6]: The barometer was rapidly rising .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 10]: The center of the cyclone had swept far ahead .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 15]: There was only left the aftermath of heavy seas and furious but steadier wind .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 10]: Captain Ross entered the charthouse for the twentieth time .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 8]: He had aged many years in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 16]: The smiling , confident , debonair officer was changed into a stricken , mournful man .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 7]: He had altered with his ship .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 21]: The _ Sirdar _ and her master could hardly be recognized , so cruel were the blows they had received .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 19]: `` It is impossible to see a yard ahead , '' he confided to his second in command .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 12]: `` I have never been so anxious before in my life .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 10]: Thank God the night is drawing to a close .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 17]: Perhaps , when day breaks -- '' His last words contained a prayer and a hope .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 23]: Even as he spoke the ship seemed to lift herself bodily with an unusual effort for a vessel moving before the wind .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 11]: The next instant there was a horrible grinding crash forward .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 18]: Each person who did not chance to be holding fast to an upright was thrown violently down .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 39]: The deck was tilted to a dangerous angle and remained there , whilst the heavy buffeting of the sea , now raging afresh at this unlooked-for resistance , drowned the despairing yells raised by the Lascars on duty .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 10]: The _ Sirdar _ had completed her last voyage .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: She was now a battered wreck on a barrier reef .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 8]: She hung thus for one heart-breaking second .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 34]: Then another wave , riding triumphantly through its fellows , caught the great steamer in its tremendous grasp , carried her onward for half her length and smashed her down on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 5]: Her back was broken .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 6]: She parted in two halves .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 44]: Both sections turned completely over in the utter wantonness of destruction , and everything -- masts , funnels , boats , hull , with every living soul on board -- was at once engulfed in a maelstrom of rushing water and far-flung spray .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 32]: CHAPTER II THE SURVIVORS When the _ Sirdar _ parted amidships , the floor of the saloon heaved up in the center with a mighty crash of rending woodwork and iron .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 18]: Men and women , too stupefied to sob out a prayer , were pitched headlong into chaos .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 48]: Iris , torn from the terrified grasp of her maid , fell through a corridor , and would have gone down with the ship had not a sailor , clinging to a companion ladder , caught her as she whirled along the steep slope of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 8]: He did not know what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 15]: With the instinct of self-preservation he seized the nearest support when the vessel struck .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 28]: It was the mere impulse of ready helpfulness that caused him to stretch out his left arm and clasp the girl 's waist as she fluttered past .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 26]: By idle chance they were on the port side , and the ship , after pausing for one awful second , fell over to starboard .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 10]: The man was not prepared for this second gyration .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 28]: Even as the stairway canted he lost his balance ; they were both thrown violently through the open hatchway , and swept off into the boiling surf .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 8]: Under such conditions thought itself was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 27]: A series of impressions , a number of fantastic pictures , were received by the benumbed faculties , and afterwards painfully sorted out by the memory .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 12]: Fear , anguish , amazement -- none of these could exist .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 29]: All he knew was that the lifeless form of a woman -- for Iris had happily fainted -- must be held until death itself wrenched her from him .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 20]: Then there came the headlong plunge into the swirling sea , followed by an indefinite period of gasping oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 13]: Something that felt like a moving rock rose up beneath his feet .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 23]: He was driven clear out of the water and seemed to recognize a familiar object rising rigid and bright close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 32]: It was the binnacle pillar , screwed to a portion of the deck which came away from the charthouse and was rent from the upper framework by contact with the reef .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 10]: He seized this unlooked-for support with his disengaged hand .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 16]: For one fleet instant he had a confused vision of the destruction of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 16]: Both the fore and aft portions were burst asunder by the force of compressed air .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 9]: Wreckage and human forms were tossing about foolishly .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 16]: The sea pounded upon the opposing rocks with the noise of ten thousand mighty steam-hammers .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 29]: A uniformed figure -- he thought it was the captain -- stretched out an unavailing arm to clasp the queer raft which supported the sailor and the girl .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 28]: But a jealous wave rose under the platform with devilish energy and turned it completely over , hurling the man with his inanimate burthen into the depths .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 9]: He rose , fighting madly for his life .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 6]: Now surely he was doomed !
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 44]: But again , as if human existence depended on naught more serious than the spinning of a coin , his knees rested on the same few staunch timbers , now the ceiling of the music-room , and he was given a brief respite .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 20]: His greatest difficulty was to get his breath , so dense was the spray through which he was driven .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 10]: Even in that terrible moment he kept his senses .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 19]: The girl , utterly unconscious , showed by the convulsive heaving of her breast that she was choking .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 21]: With a wild effort he swung her head round to shield her from the flying scud with his own form .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 21]: The tiny air-space thus provided gave her some relief , and in that instant the sailor seemed to recognize her .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 10]: He was not remotely capable of a definite idea .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 23]: Just as he vaguely realized the identity of the woman in his arms the unsteady support on which he rested toppled over .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 7]: Again he renewed the unequal contest .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 12]: A strong resolute man and a typhoon sea wrestled for supremacy .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 10]: This time his feet plunged against something gratefully solid .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 27]: He was dashed forward , still battling with the raging turmoil of water , and a second time he felt the same firm yet smooth surface .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 5]: His dormant faculties awoke .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 4]: It was sand .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 22]: With frenzied desperation , buoyed now by the inspiring hope of safety , he fought his way onwards like a maniac .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 52]: Often he fell , three times did the backwash try to drag him to the swirling death behind , but he staggered blindly on , on , until even the tearing gale ceased to be laden with the suffocating foam , and his faltering feet sank in deep soft white sand .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 26]: -LSB- Illustration : WITH FRENZIED DESPERATION , BUOYED NOW BY THE INSPIRING HOPE OF SAFETY , HE FOUGHT HIS WAY ONWARD LIKE A MANIAC . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: Then he fell , not to rise again .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 31]: With a last weak flicker of exhausted strength he drew the girl closely to him , and the two lay , clasped tightly together , heedless now of all things .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 12]: How long the man remained prostrate he could only guess subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 35]: The _ Sirdar _ struck soon after daybreak and the sailor awoke to a hazy consciousness of his surroundings to find a shaft of sunshine flickering through the clouds banked up in the east .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 7]: The gale was already passing away .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 15]: Although the wind still whistled with shrill violence it was more blustering than threatening .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 34]: The sea , too , though running very high , had retreated many yards from the spot where he had finally dropped , and its surface was no longer scourged with venomous spray .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 18]: Slowly and painfully he raised himself to a sitting posture , for he was bruised and stiff .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 9]: With his first movement he became violently ill .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 25]: He had swallowed much salt water , and it was not until the spasm of sickness had passed that he thought of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 21]: She had slipped from his breast as he rose , and was lying , face downwards , in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 15]: The memory of much that had happened surged into his brain with horrifying suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 18]: `` She can not be dead , '' he hoarsely murmured , feebly trying to lift her .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 12]: `` Surely Providence would not desert her after such an escape .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 15]: What a weak beggar I must be to give in at the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 11]: I am sure she was living when we got ashore .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 11]: What on earth can I do to revive her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 28]: Forgetful of his own aching limbs in this newborn anxiety , he sank on one knee and gently pillowed Iris 's head and shoulders on the other .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 46]: Her eyes were closed , her lips and teeth firmly set -- a fact to which she undoubtedly owed her life , else she would have been suffocated -- and the pallor of her skin seemed to be that terrible bloodless hue which indicates death .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 16]: The stern lines in the man 's face relaxed , and something blurred his vision .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 10]: He was weak from exhaustion and want of food .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 9]: For the moment his emotions were easily aroused .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 12]: `` Oh , it is pitiful , '' he almost whimpered .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 7]: `` It can not be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 24]: With a gesture of despair he drew the sleeve of his thick jersey across his eyes to clear them from the gathering mist .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 16]: Then he tremblingly endeavored to open the neck of her dress and unclasp her corsets .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 33]: He had a vague notion that ladies in a fainting condition required such treatment , and he was desperately resolved to bring Iris Deane back to conscious existence if it were possible .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 12]: His task was rendered difficult by the waistband of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 10]: He slipped out a clasp-knife and opened the blade .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 41]: Not until then did he discover that the nail of the forefinger on his right hand had been torn out by the quick , probably during his endeavors to grasp the unsteady support which contributed so materially to his escape .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 15]: It still hung by a shred and hindered the free use of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 21]: Without any hesitation he seized the offending nail in his teeth and completed the surgical operation by a rapid jerk .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 23]: Bending to resume his task he was startled to find the girl 's eyes wide open and surveying him with shadowy alarm .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 18]: She was quite conscious , absurdly so in a sense , and had noticed his strange action .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 4]: he cried hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 6]: `` You are alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 12]: Her mind as yet could only work in a single groove .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: `` Why did you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 5]: `` Do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 7]: `` Bite your nail off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 7]: `` It was in my way .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 11]: I wished to cut open your dress at the waist .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 19]: You were collapsed , almost dead , I thought , and I wanted to unfasten your corsets . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 8]: Her color came back with remarkable rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 20]: From all the rich variety of the English tongue few words could have been selected of such restorative effect .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 18]: She tried to assume a sitting posture , and instinctively her hands traveled to her disarranged costume .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 5]: `` How ridiculous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 18]: she said , with a little note of annoyance in her voice , which sounded curiously hollow .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 12]: But her brave spirit could not yet command her enfeebled frame .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 16]: She was perforce compelled to sink back to the support of his knee and arm .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 17]: `` Do you think you could lie quiet until I try to find some water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 4]: he gasped anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 11]: She nodded a childlike acquiescence , and her eyelids fell .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 29]: It was only that her eyes smarted dreadfully from the salt water , but the sailor was sure that this was a premonition of a lapse to unconsciousness .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 12]: `` Please try not to faint again , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: `` Do n't you think I had better loosen these things ?
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 7]: You can breathe more easily . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 10]: A ghost of a smile flickered on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 9]: `` No -- no , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 10]: `` My eyes hurt me -- that is all .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 8]: Is there -- any -- water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 13]: He laid her tenderly on the sand and rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 8]: His first glance was towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 10]: He saw something which made him blink with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 16]: A heavy sea was still running over the barrier reef which enclosed a small lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 20]: The contrast between the fierce commotion outside and the comparatively smooth surface of the protected pool was very marked .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 10]: At low tide the lagoon was almost completely isolated .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 46]: Indeed , he imagined that only a fierce gale blowing from the north-west would enable the waves to leap the reef , save where a strip of broken water , surging far into the small natural harbor , betrayed the position of the tiny entrance .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 30]: Yet at this very point a fine cocoanut palm reared its stately column high in air , and its long tremulous fronds were now swinging wildly before the gale .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 25]: From where he stood it appeared to be growing in the midst of the sea , for huge breakers completely hid the coral embankment .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 11]: This sentinel of the land had a weirdly impressive effect .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 13]: It was the only fixed object in the waste of foam-capped waves .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 24]: Not a vestige of the _ Sirdar _ remained seaward , but the sand was littered with wreckage , and -- mournful spectacle !
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 18]: -- a considerable number of inanimate human forms lay huddled up amidst the relics of the steamer .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 7]: This discovery stirred him to action .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: He turned to survey the land on which he was stranded with his helpless companion .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 13]: To his great relief he discovered that it was lofty and tree-clad .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 20]: He knew that the ship could not have drifted to Borneo , which still lay far to the south .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 21]: This must be one of the hundreds of islands which stud the China Sea and provide resorts for Haïnan fishermen .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 21]: Probably it was inhabited , though he thought it strange that none of the islanders had put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 15]: In any event , water and food , of some sort , were assured .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 12]: But before setting out upon his quest two things demanded attention .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 10]: The girl must be removed from her present position .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 21]: It would be too horrible to permit her first conscious gaze to rest upon those crumpled objects on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 23]: Common humanity demanded , too , that he should hastily examine each of the bodies in case life was not wholly extinct .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 28]: So he bent over the girl , noting with sudden wonder that , weak as she was , she had managed to refasten part of her bodice .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 18]: `` You must permit me to carry you a little further inland , '' he explained gently .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 52]: Without another word he lifted her in his arms , marveling somewhat at the strength which came of necessity , and bore her some little distance , until a sturdy rock , jutting out of the sand , offered shelter from the wind and protection from the sea and its revelations .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 13]: `` I am so cold , and tired , '' murmured Iris .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 6]: `` Is there any water ?
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 6]: My throat hurts me . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 16]: He pressed back the tangled hair from her forehead as he might soothe a child .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 15]: `` Try to lie still for a very few minutes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 8]: `` You have not long to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: I will return immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 25]: His own throat and palate were on fire owing to the brine , but he first hurried back to the edge of the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 20]: There were fourteen bodies in all , three women and eleven men , four of the latter being Lascars .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 11]: The women were saloon passengers whom he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 19]: One of the men was the surgeon , another the first officer , a third Sir John Tozer .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 10]: The rest were passengers and members of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 19]: They were all dead ; some had been peacefully drowned , others were fearfully mangled by the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 23]: Two of the Lascars , bearing signs of dreadful injuries , were lying on a cluster of low rocks overhanging the water .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 7]: The remainder rested on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 13]: The sailor exhibited no visible emotion whilst he conducted his sad scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 24]: When he was assured that this silent company was beyond mortal help he at once strode away towards the nearest belt of trees .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 22]: He could not tell how long the search for water might be protracted , and there was pressing need for it .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 14]: When he reached the first clump of brushwood he uttered a delighted exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 41]: There , growing in prodigal luxuriance , was the beneficent pitcher-plant , whose large curled-up leaf , shaped like a teacup , not only holds a lasting quantity of rain-water , but mixes therewith its own palatable and natural juices .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 30]: With his knife he severed two of the leaves , swearing emphatically the while on account of his damaged finger , and hastened to Iris with the precious beverage .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 12]: She heard him and managed to raise herself on an elbow .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 12]: The poor girl 's eyes glistened at the prospect of relief .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 15]: Without a word of question or surprise she swallowed the contents of both leaves .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 5]: Then she found utterance .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 6]: `` How odd it tastes !
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 16]: But the eagerness with which she quenched her thirst renewed his own momentarily forgotten torture .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 6]: His tongue seemed to swell .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: He was absolutely unable to reply .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 9]: The water revived Iris like a magic draught .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 9]: Her quick intuition told her what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 11]: `` You have had none yourself , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 8]: `` Go at once and get some .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 8]: And please bring me some more . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 6]: He required no second bidding .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 16]: After hastily gulping down the contents of several leaves he returned with a further supply .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 6]: Iris was now sitting up .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 22]: The sun had burst royally through the clouds , and her chilled limbs were gaining some degree of warmth and elasticity .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 7]: she repeated after another delicious draught .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 7]: `` The leaf of the pitcher-plant .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 6]: Nature is not always cruel .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 14]: In an unusually generous mood she devised this method of storing water . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 9]: Miss Deane reached out her hand for more .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 15]: Her troubled brain refused to wonder at such a reply from an ordinary seaman .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 14]: The sailor deliberately spilled the contents of a remaining leaf on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 18]: `` No , madam , '' he said , with an odd mixture of deference and firmness .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 6]: `` No more at present .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 9]: I must first procure you some food . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 9]: She looked up at him in momentary silence .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 7]: `` The ship is lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: she said after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: `` Yes , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 9]: `` Are we the only people saved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 6]: `` I fear so . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 8]: `` Is this a desert island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 7]: `` I think not , madam .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 27]: It may , by chance , be temporarily uninhabited , but fishermen from China come to all these places to collect tortoise-shell and _ bêche-de-mer _ .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 22]: I have seen no other living beings except ourselves ; nevertheless , the islanders may live on the south side . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 3]: Another pause .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 31]: Amidst the thrilling sensations of the moment Iris found herself idly speculating as to the meaning of _ bêche-de-mer _ , and why this common sailor pronounced French so well .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 7]: Her thoughts reverted to the steamer .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 27]: `` It surely can not be possible that the _ Sirdar _ has gone to pieces -- a magnificent vessel of her size and strength ? ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 12]: He answered quietly -- `` It is too true , madam .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 13]: I suppose you hardly knew she struck , it happened so suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: Afterwards , fortunately for you , you were unconscious . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 4]: she inquired quickly .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 11]: A flood of vivid recollection was pouring in upon her .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 32]: `` I -- er -- well , I happened to be near you , madam , when the ship broke up , and we -- er -- drifted ashore together . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 6]: She rose and faced him .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 10]: `` I remember now , '' she cried hysterically .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 12]: `` You caught me as I was thrown into the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 11]: We fell into the sea when the vessel turned over .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 6]: You have saved my life .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 13]: Were it not for you I could not possibly have escaped . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 23]: She gazed at him more earnestly , seeing that he blushed beneath the crust of salt and sand that covered his face .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 23]: `` Why , '' she went on with growing excitement , `` you are the steward I noticed in the saloon yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 13]: How is it that you are now dressed as a sailor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 5]: He answered readily enough .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 13]: `` There was an accident on board during the gale , madam .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 17]: I am a fair sailor but a poor steward , so I applied for a transfer .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 11]: As the crew were short-handed my offer was accepted . ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 8]: Iris was now looking at him intently .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 11]: `` You saved my life , '' she repeated slowly .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 15]: It seemed that this obvious fact needed to be indelibly established in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 13]: Indeed the girl was overwrought by all that she had gone through .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 12]: Only by degrees were her thoughts marshaling themselves with lucid coherence .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 17]: As yet , she recalled so many dramatic incidents that they failed to assume due proportion .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 35]: But quickly there came memories of Captain Ross , of Sir John and Lady Tozer , of the doctor , her maid , the hundred and one individualities of her pleasant life aboard ship .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 9]: Could it be that they were all dead ?
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 5]: The notion was monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 18]: But its ghastly significance was instantly borne in upon her by the plight in which she stood .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 11]: Her lips quivered ; the tears trembled in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 17]: `` Is it really true that all the ship 's company except ourselves are lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 4]: she brokenly demanded .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 10]: The sailor 's gravely earnest glance fell before hers .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: `` Unhappily there is no room for doubt , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: `` Are you quite , quite sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 9]: `` I am sure -- of some . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 5]: Involuntarily he turned seawards .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 4]: She understood him .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 21]: She sank to her knees , covered her face with her hands , and broke into a passion of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 22]: With a look of infinite pity he stooped and would have touched her shoulder , but he suddenly restrained the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 6]: Something had hardened this man .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 13]: It cost him an effort to be callous , but he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 10]: His mouth tightened and his expression lost its tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 31]: `` Come , come , my dear lady , '' he exclaimed , and there was a tinge of studied roughness in his voice , `` you must calm yourself .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 15]: It is the fortune of shipwreck as well as of war , you know .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 9]: We are alive and must look after ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 10]: Those who have gone are beyond our help . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 22]: `` But not beyond our sympathy , '' wailed Iris , uncovering her swimming eyes for a fleeting look at him .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 73]: Even in the utter desolation of the moment she could not help marveling that this queer-mannered sailor , who spoke like a gentleman and tried to pose as her inferior , who had rescued her with the utmost gallantry , who carried his Quixotic zeal to the point of first supplying her needs when he was in far worse case himself , should be so utterly indifferent to the fate of others .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: He waited silently until her sobs ceased .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 20]: `` Now , madam , '' he said , `` it is essential that we should obtain some food .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 17]: I do n't wish to leave you alone until we are better acquainted with our whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 17]: Can you walk a little way towards the trees , or shall I assist you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 5]: Iris immediately stood up .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 7]: She pressed her hair back defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 10]: `` Certainly I can walk , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 9]: `` What do you propose to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 13]: `` Well , madam -- '' `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 4]: she interrupted imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 5]: `` Jenks , madam .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 4]: Robert Jenks . ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: Now , listen , Mr. Robert Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 7]: My name is Miss Iris Deane .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 22]: On board ship I was a passenger and you were a steward -- that is , until you became a seaman .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 21]: Here we are equals in misfortune , but in all else you are the leader -- I am quite useless .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 26]: I can only help in matters by your direction , so I do not wish to be addressed as ` madam ' in every breath .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 18]: Conscious that her large blue eyes were fixed indignantly upon him Mr. Robert Jenks repressed a smile .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 12]: She was still hysterical and must be humored in her vagaries .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 10]: What an odd moment for a discussion on etiquette !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 12]: `` As you wish , Miss Deane , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 21]: `` The fact remains that I have many things to attend to , and we really must eat something . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 7]: `` What can we eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 18]: `` Let us find out , '' he replied , scanning the nearest trees with keen scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 9]: They plodded together through the sand in silence .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 15]: Physically , they were a superb couple , but in raiment they resembled scarecrows .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 8]: Both , of course , were bare-headed .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 25]: The sailor 's jersey and trousers were old and torn , and the sea-water still soughed loudly in his heavy boots with each step .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 8]: But Iris was in a deplorable plight .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 17]: Her hair fell in a great wave of golden brown strands over her neck and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 21]: Every hairpin had vanished , but with a few dexterous twists she coiled the flying tresses into a loose knot .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 9]: Her beautiful muslin dress was rent and draggled .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 28]: It was drying rapidly under the ever-increasing power of the sun , and she surreptitiously endeavored to complete the fastening of the open portion about her neck .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 11]: Other details must be left until a more favorable opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 15]: She recalled the strange sight that first met her eyes when she recovered consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: `` You hurt your finger , '' she said abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 7]: `` Let me see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 24]: They had reached the shelter of the trees , pleasantly grateful now , so powerful are tropical sunbeams at even an early hour .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 11]: He held out his right hand without looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 14]: Indeed , his eyes had been studiously averted during the past few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 13]: Her womanly feelings were aroused by the condition of the ragged wound .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 11]: `` Oh , you poor fellow , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 7]: `` How awful it must be !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 5]: How did it happen ?
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 7]: Let me tie it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 12]: `` It is not so bad now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 13]: `` It has been well soaked in salt water , you know .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 22]: I think the nail was torn off when we -- when a piece of wreckage miraculously turned up beneath us . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 8]: Iris shredded a strip from her dress .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 8]: She bound the finger with deft tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 9]: `` Thank you , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 7]: Then he gave a glad shout .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 10]: Miss Deane , we are in luck 's way .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 8]: There is a fine plantain tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 9]: The pangs of hunger could not be resisted .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 16]: Although the fruit was hardly ripe they tore at the great bunches and ate ravenously .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 30]: Iris made no pretence in the matter , and the sailor was in worse plight , for he had been on duty continuously since four o'clock the previous afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 21]: At last their appetite was somewhat appeased , though plantains might not appeal to a gourmand as the solitary joint .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 19]: `` Now , '' decided Jenks , `` you must rest here a little while , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: I am going back to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 6]: You need not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 17]: There are no animals to harm you , and I will not be far away . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 12]: `` What are you going to do on the beach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 11]: `` To rescue stores , for the most part . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 19]: `` May I not come with you -- I can be of some little service , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 14]: He answered slowly : `` Please oblige me by remaining here at present .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 22]: In less than an hour I will return , and then , perhaps , you will find plenty to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 8]: She read his meaning intuitively and shivered .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 13]: `` I could not do _ that _ , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 5]: `` I would faint .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 15]: Whilst you are away I will pray for them -- my unfortunate friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 12]: As he passed from her side he heard her sobbing quietly .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 9]: When he reached the lagoon he halted suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 4]: Something startled him .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 11]: He was quite certain that he had counted fourteen corpses .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 6]: Now there were only twelve .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 24]: The two Lascars ' bodies , which rested on the small group of rocks on the verge of the lagoon , had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 6]: Where had they gone to ?
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 12]: CHAPTER III DISCOVERIES The sailor wasted no time in idle bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 10]: He searched carefully for traces of the missing Lascars .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 32]: He came to the conclusion that the bodies had been dragged from off the sun-dried rocks into the lagoon by some agency the nature of which he could not even conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: They were lying many feet above the sea-level when he last saw them , little more than half an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: At that point the beach shelved rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 13]: He could look far into the depths of the rapidly clearing water .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 11]: Nothing was visible there save several varieties of small fish .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 7]: The incident puzzled and annoyed him .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 24]: Still thinking about it , he sat down on the highest rock and pulled off his heavy boots to empty the water out .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 14]: He also divested himself of his stockings and spread them out to dry .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 10]: The action reminded him of Miss Deane 's necessities .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 25]: He hurried to a point whence he could call out to her and recommend her to dry some of her clothing during his absence .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 13]: He retired even more quickly , fearing lest he should be seen .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 14]: Iris had already displayed to the sunlight a large portion of her costume .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 12]: Without further delay he set about a disagreeable but necessary task .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 42]: From the pockets of the first officer and doctor he secured two revolvers and a supply of cartridges , evidently intended to settle any dispute which might have arisen between the ship 's officers and the native members of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 23]: He hoped the cartridges were uninjured ; but he could not test them at the moment for fear of alarming Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 7]: Both officers carried pocket-books and pencils .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 36]: In one of these , containing dry leaves , the sailor made a careful inventory of the money and other valuable effects he found upon the dead , besides noting names and documents where possible .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 30]: Curiously enough , the capitalist of this island morgue was a Lascar jemadar , who in a belt around his waist hoarded more than one hundred pounds in gold .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 25]: The sailor tied in a handkerchief all the money he collected , and ranged pocket-books , letters , and jewelry in separate little heaps .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 12]: Then he stripped the men of their boots and outer clothing .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 26]: He could not tell how long the girl and he might be detained on the island before help came , and fresh garments were essential .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 15]: It would be foolish sentimentality to trust to stores thrown ashore from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 17]: Nevertheless , when it became necessary to search and disrobe the women he almost broke down .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 6]: For an instant he softened .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 12]: Gulping back his emotions with a savage imprecation he doggedly persevered .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 14]: At last he paused to consider what should be done with the bodies .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 64]: His first intent was to scoop a large hole in the sand with a piece of timber ; but when he took into consideration the magnitude of the labor involved , requiring many hours of hard work and a waste of precious time which might be of infinite value to his helpless companion and himself , he was forced to abandon the project .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 8]: It was not only impracticable but dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 11]: Again he had to set his teeth with grim resolution .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 17]: One by one the bodies were shot into the lagoon from the little quay of rock .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 9]: He knew they would not be seen again .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 6]: He was quite unnerved now .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 11]: He felt as if he had committed a colossal crime .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 17]: In the smooth water of the cove a number of black fins were cutting arrow-shaped ripples .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 6]: The sharks were soon busy .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 3]: He shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 18]: God 's Providence had ferried him and the girl across that very place a few hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 16]: How wonderful that he and she should be snatched from the sea whilst hundreds perished !
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: Why was it ?
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 10]: And those others -- why were they denied rescue ?
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 15]: For an instant he was nearer to prayer than he had been for years .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 19]: Some lurking fiend of recollection sprang from out the vista of bygone years and choked back the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 9]: He arose and shook himself like a dog .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 7]: There was much to be done .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 22]: He gathered the clothes and other articles into a heap and placed portions of shattered packing-cases near -- to mislead Iris .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 18]: Whilst thus engaged he kicked up out of the sand a rusty kriss , or Malay sword .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: The presence of this implement startled him .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: He examined it slowly and thrust it out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 18]: Then he went back to her , after donning his stockings and boots , now thoroughly dry .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 10]: `` Are you ready now , Miss Deane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 5]: he sang out cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 3]: `` Ready ?
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 8]: I have been waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 4]: Jenks chuckled quietly .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 17]: `` I must guard my tongue : it betrays me , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 4]: Iris joined him .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 13]: By some mysterious means she had effected great improvement in her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 6]: Yet there were manifest gaps .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 14]: `` If only I had a needle and thread -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 16]: `` If that is all , '' said the sailor , fumbling in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 21]: He produced a shabby little hussif , containing a thimble , scissors , needles and some skeins of unbleached thread .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 25]: Case and contents were sodden or rusted with salt water , but the girl fastened upon this treasure with a sigh of deep content .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 20]: `` Now , please , '' she cried , `` I want a telegraph office and a ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 12]: It was impossible to resist the infection of her high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 7]: This time he laughed without concealment .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 10]: `` We will look for them , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 10]: Meanwhile , will you oblige me by wearing this ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 8]: The sun is climbing up rapidly . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 11]: He handed her a sou ` wester which he carried .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 7]: He had secured another for himself .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 8]: The merriment died away from her face .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: She remembered his errand .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 22]: Being an eminently sensible young woman she made no protest , even forcing herself to tie the strings beneath her chin .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 27]: When they reached the sands she caught sight of the pile of clothes and the broken woodwork , with the small heaps of valuables methodically arranged .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: The harmless subterfuge did not deceive her .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 11]: She darted a quick look of gratitude at her companion .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 5]: How thoughtful he was !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 19]: After a fearful glance around she was reassured , though she wondered what had become of -- them .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 19]: `` I see you have been busy , '' she said , nodding towards the clothes and boots .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 12]: It was his turn to steal a look of sharp inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 25]: ` Twere an easier task to read the records of time in the solid rock than to glean knowledge from the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' he replied simply .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 9]: `` Lucky find , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 4]: `` Most fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: When they are quite dry I will replenish my wardrobe .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 10]: What is the first thing to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 33]: `` Well , Miss Deane , I think our programme is , in the first place , to examine the articles thrown ashore and see if any of the cases contain food .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 32]: Secondly , we should haul high and dry everything that may be of use to us , lest the weather should break again and the next tide sweep away the spoil .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 21]: Thirdly , we should eat and rest , and finally , we must explore the island before the light fails .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 8]: I am convinced we are alone here .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 26]: It is a small place at the best , and if any Chinamen were ashore they would have put in an appearance long since . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 15]: `` Do you think , then , that we may remain here long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 12]: `` It is impossible to form an opinion on that point .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 7]: Help may come in a day .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 10]: On the other hand -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 17]: `` It is a wise thing , Miss Deane , to prepare for other contingencies . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 12]: She stood still , and swept the horizon with comprehensive eyes .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 5]: The storm had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 18]: Masses of cloud were passing away to the west , leaving a glorious expanse of blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 6]: Already the sea was calming .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 20]: Huge breakers roared over the reef , but beyond it the waves were subsiding into a heavy unbroken swell .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: The sailor watched her closely .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 15]: In the quaint oilskin hat and her tattered muslin dress she looked bewitchingly pretty .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 23]: She reminded him of a well-bred and beautiful society lady whom he once saw figuring as Grace Darling at a fashionable bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 8]: But Miss Iris 's thoughts were serious .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 37]: `` Do you mean , '' she said slowly , without moving her gaze from the distant meeting-place of sky and water , `` that we may be imprisoned here for weeks , perhaps months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 26]: `` If you cast your mind back a few hours you will perhaps admit that we are very fortunate to be here at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: She whisked round upon him .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 11]: `` Do not fence with my question , Mr. Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 4]: Answer me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: He bowed .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 13]: There was a perceptible return of his stubborn cynicism when he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 9]: `` The facts are obvious , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 16]: The loss of the _ Sirdar _ will not be definitely known for many days .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 10]: It will be assumed that she has broken down .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 12]: The agents in Singapore will await cabled tidings of her whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 9]: She might have drifted anywhere in that typhoon .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 23]: Ultimately they will send out a vessel to search , impelled to that course a little earlier by your father 's anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 3]: Pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 8]: I did not intend to pain you .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 7]: I am speaking my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' said Iris bravely .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 11]: `` The relief ship must search the entire China Sea .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 16]: The gale might have driven a disabled steamer north , south , east or west .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 28]: A typhoon travels in a whirling spiral , you see , and the direction of a drifting ship depends wholly upon the locality where she sustained damage .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 26]: The coasts of China , Java , Borneo , and the Philippines are not equipped with lighthouses on every headland and cordoned with telegraph wires .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 12]: There are river pirates and savage races to be reckoned with .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 45]: Casting aside all other possibilities , and assuming that a prompt search is made to the south of our course , this part of the ocean is full of reefs and small islands , some inhabited permanently , others visited occasionally by fishermen . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 11]: He was about to add something , but checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 24]: `` To sum up , '' he continued hurriedly , `` we may have to remain here for many days , even months .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 9]: There is always a chance of speedy help .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 16]: We must act , however , on the basis of detention for an indefinite period .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: I am discussing appearances as they are .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: A survey of the island may change all these views . ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: `` In what way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 14]: He turned and pointed to the summit of the tree-covered hill behind them .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 18]: `` From that point , '' he said , `` we may see other and larger islands .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 9]: If so , they will certainly be inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 9]: I am surprised this one is not . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 4]: He ended abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 5]: They were losing time .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 18]: Before Iris could join him he was already hauling a large undamaged case out of the water .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: He laughed unmirthfully .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 4]: `` Champagne ! ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 11]: he said , `` A good brand , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 7]: This man was certainly an enigma .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 16]: Iris wrinkled her pretty forehead in the effort to place him in a fitting category .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 27]: His words and accent were those of an educated gentleman , yet his actions and manners were studiously uncouth when he thought she was observing him .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 7]: The veneer of roughness puzzled her .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 28]: That he was naturally of refined temperament she knew quite well , not alone by perception but by the plain evidence of his earlier dealings with her .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 19]: Then why this affectation of coarseness , this borrowed aroma of the steward 's mess and the forecastle ?
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 15]: To the best of her ability she silently helped in the work of salvage .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 6]: They made a queer collection .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 10]: A case of champagne , and another of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 5]: A box of books .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 6]: A pair of night glasses .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 3]: A compass .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 25]: Several boxes of ship 's biscuits , coated with salt , but saved by their hardness , having been immersed but a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: Two large cases of hams in equally good condition .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 4]: Some huge dish-covers .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 15]: A bit of twisted ironwork , and a great quantity of cordage and timber .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 14]: There was one very heavy package which their united strength could not lift .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 18]: The sailor searched round until he found an iron bar that could be wrenched from its socket .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 25]: With this he pried open the strong outer cover and revealed the contents -- regulation boxes of Lee-Metford ammunition , each containing 500 rounds .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 11]: he cried , `` now we want some rifles . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 8]: `` What good would they be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 3]: inquired Iris .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 25]: He softly denounced himself as a fool , but he answered at once : `` To shoot birds , of course , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 13]: There are plenty here , and many of them are edible . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 10]: `` You have two revolvers and some cartridges . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 14]: They are useful in a way , but not for pot hunting . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: `` How stupid of me !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 9]: What you really need is a shot-gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 4]: He smiled grimly .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 22]: At times his sense of humor forced a way through the outward shield of reserve , of defiance it might be .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 35]: `` The only persons I ever heard of , '' he said , `` who landed under compulsion on a desert island with a ship-load of requisites , were the Swiss Family Robinson . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 17]: cried Iris irrelevantly ; `` I had not even thought of Robinson Crusoe until this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 5]: Is n't it odd ?
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 17]: I -- we -- '' She pulled herself up short , firmly resolved not to blush .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 10]: Without flinching she challenged him to complete her sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 6]: He dared not do it .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 13]: He could not be mean enough to take advantage of her slip .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: Instantly he helped her embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 14]: `` I hope the parallel will not hold good , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 19]: `` In any event , you , Miss Deane , fill a part less familiar in fiction . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 5]: The phrase was neat .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 10]: It meant much or little , as fancy dictated .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 10]: Iris at first felt profoundly grateful for his tact .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 13]: Thinking the words over at leisure she became hot and very angry .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 8]: They worked in silence for another hour .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: The sun was nearing the zenith .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 11]: They were distressed with the increasing heat of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 27]: Jenks secured a ham and some biscuits , some pieces of driftwood and the binoculars , and invited Miss Deane to accompany him to the grove .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 17]: She obeyed without a word , though she wondered how he proposed to light a fire .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 18]: To contribute something towards the expected feast she picked up a dish-cover and a bottle of champagne .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 9]: The sailor eyed the concluding item with disfavor .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: `` Not whilst the sun is up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 8]: `` In the evening , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 12]: `` It was for you , '' explained Iris , coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 8]: `` I do not drink wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 14]: `` You must break the pledge whilst you are here , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 11]: It is often very cold at night in this latitude .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: A chill would mean fever and perhaps death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 7]: `` What a strange man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 4]: murmured the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 6]: She covertly watched his preparations .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 26]: He tore a dry leaf from a notebook and broke the bullet out of a cartridge , damping the powder with water from a pitcher-plant .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 20]: Smearing the composition on the paper , he placed it in the sun , where it dried at once .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 30]: He gathered a small bundle of withered spines from the palms , and arranged the driftwood on top , choosing a place for his bonfire just within the shade .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 37]: Then , inserting the touch-paper among the spines , he unscrewed one of the lenses of the binoculars , converted it into a burning-glass , and had a fine blaze roaring merrily in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 27]: With the aid of pointed sticks he grilled some slices of ham , cut with his clasp-knife , which he first carefully cleaned in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 24]: The biscuits were of the variety that become soft when toasted , and so he balanced a few by stones near the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 8]: Iris forgot her annoyance in her interest .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 8]: A most appetizing smell filled the air .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 9]: They were having a picnic amidst delightful surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 22]: Yesterday at this time -- she almost yielded to a rush of sentiment , but forced it back with instant determination .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 17]: Tears were a poor resource , unmindful of God 's goodness to herself and her companion .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 19]: Without the sailor what would have become of her , even were she thrown ashore while still living ?
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 14]: She knew none of the expedients which seemed to be at his command .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 26]: It was a most ungrateful proceeding to be vexed with him for her own thoughtless suggestion that she occupied a new rôle as Mrs. Crusoe .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 9]: `` Can I do nothing to help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 10]: So contrite was her tone that Jenks was astonished .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' he said , pointing to the dish-cover .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 18]: `` If you polish the top of that with your sleeve it will serve as a plate .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 5]: Luncheon is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 23]: He neatly dished up two slices of ham on a couple of biscuits and handed them to her , with the clasp-knife .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 12]: `` I can depend on my fingers , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 10]: `` It will not be the first time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 9]: `` Have you led an adventurous life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: she asked , by way of polite conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 7]: `` No , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 25]: `` I only thought so because you appear to know all sorts of dodges for prolonging existence -- things I never heard of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 11]: `` Broiled ham -- and biscuits -- for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 13]: At another time Iris would have snapped at him for the retort .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 24]: Still humbly regretful for her previous attitude she answered meekly -- `` Yes , in this manner of cooking them , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 45]: But there are other items -- methods of lighting fires , finding water , knowing what fruits and other articles may be found on a desert island , such as plantains and cocoanuts , certain sorts of birds -- and _ bêche-de-mer _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 20]: For the life of her she could not tell why she tacked on that weird item to her list .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 16]: The sailor inquired , more civilly -- `` Then you are acquainted with trepang ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 11]: `` Trepang -- _ bêche-de-mer _ , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: Iris made a desperate guess .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' she said , demurely .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 9]: `` It makes beautiful backs for hair brushes .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 12]: And it looks so nice as a frame for platinotype photographs .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 16]: I have -- '' Jenks swallowed a large piece of ham and became very red .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 13]: At last he managed to say -- `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 6]: You are thinking of tortoise-shell .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 11]: _ Bêche-de-mer _ is a sort of marine slug . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 5]: `` How odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 3]: said Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 33]: She had discovered at an early age the tactical value of this remark , and the experience of maturer years confirmed the success of juvenile efforts to upset the equanimity of governesses .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 6]: Even the sailor was silenced .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 8]: Talk ceased until the meal was ended .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 7]: Jenks sprang lightly to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 8]: Rest and food had restored his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 23]: The girl thought dreamily , as he stood there in his rough attire , that she had never seen a finer man .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 10]: He was tall , sinewy , and well formed .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 10]: In repose his face was pleasant , if masterful .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 11]: Its somewhat sullen , self-contained expression was occasional and acquired .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: She wondered how he could be so energetic .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 7]: Personally she was consumed with sleepiness .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 5]: He produced a revolver .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: `` Do you mind if I fire a shot to test these cartridges ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 18]: `` The powder is all right , but the fulminate in the caps may be damaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 4]: She agreed promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 17]: He pointed the weapon at a cluster of cocoanuts , and there was a loud report .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 22]: Two nuts fell to the ground , and the air was filled with shrill screams and the flapping of innumerable wings .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 18]: Iris was momentarily dismayed , but her senses confirmed the sailor 's explanation -- `` Sea-birds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 35]: He reloaded the empty chamber , and was about to say something , when a queer sound , exactly resembling the gurgling of water poured from a large bottle , fell upon their ears .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 20]: It came from the interior of the grove , and the two exchanged a quick look of amazed questioning .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 22]: Jenks took a hasty step in the direction of the noise , but he stopped and laughed at his own expense .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: Iris liked the sound of his mirth .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 7]: It was genuine , not forced .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 9]: `` I remember now , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 10]: `` The wou-wou monkey cries in that peculiar warble .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 18]: The presence of the animal here shows that the island has been inhabited at some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: `` You remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 4]: repeated the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: `` Then you have been in this part of the world before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: I mean I have read about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: Twice in half an hour had he curtly declined to indulge in personal reminiscences .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 8]: `` Can you use a revolver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 6]: `` My father taught me .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 15]: He thinks every woman should know how to defend herself if need be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 3]: `` Excellent .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 16]: Well , Miss Deane , you must try to sleep for a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 12]: I purpose examining the coast for some distance on each side .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 16]: Should you want me , a shot will be the best sort of signal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 10]: `` I am very tired , '' she admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 5]: `` But you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 8]: `` Oh , I am all right .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 42]: I feel restless ; that is , I mean I will not be able to sleep until night comes , and before we climb the hill to survey our domain I want to find better quarters than we now possess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 24]: Perhaps , were she less fatigued , she would have caught the vague anxiety , the note of distrust , in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 15]: But the carpet of sand and leaves on which she lay was very seductive .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 4]: Her eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 10]: She nestled into a comfortable position , and slept .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 11]: The man looked at her steadily for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 34]: Then he moved the revolver out of harm 's way to a spot where she must see it instantly , pulled his sou ` wester well over his eyes and walked off quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 12]: They were flung ashore on the north-west side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 51]: Except for the cove formed by the coral reef , with its mysterious palm-tree growing apparently in the midst of the waves , the shape of the coast was roughly that of the concave side of a bow , the two visible extremities being about three-quarters of a mile apart .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 24]: He guessed , by the way in which the sea raced past these points , that the land did not extend beyond them .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 16]: Behind him , it rose steeply to a considerable height , 150 or 200 feet .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 17]: In the center was the tallest hill , which seemed to end abruptly towards the south-west .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 18]: On the north-east side it was connected with a rocky promontory by a ridge of easy grade .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 17]: The sailor turned to the south-west , as offering the most likely direction for rapid survey .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 15]: He followed the line of vegetation ; there the ground was firm and level .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 14]: There was no suggestion of the mariner 's roll in his steady gait .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 36]: Alter his clothing , change the heavy boots into spurred Wellingtons , and he would be the _ beau idéal _ of a cavalry soldier , the order of Melchisedec in the profession of arms .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 37]: He was not surprised to find that the hill terminated in a sheer wall of rock , which stood out , ominous and massive , from the wealth of verdure clothing the remainder of the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 50]: Facing the precipice , and separated from it by a strip of ground not twenty feet above the sea-level in the highest part , was another rock-built eminence , quite bare of trees , blackened by the weather and scarred in a manner that attested the attacks of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 4]: He whistled softly .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: `` Volcanic , and highly mineralized . ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 26]: The intervening belt was sparsely dotted with trees , casuarinas , poon , and other woods he did not know , resembling ebony and cedar .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 17]: A number of stumps showed that the axe had been at work , but not recently .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 14]: He passed into the cleft and climbed a tree that offered easy access .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 30]: As he expected , after rising a few feet from the ground , his eyes encountered the solemn blue line of the sea , not half a mile distant .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 8]: He descended and commenced a systematic search .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 5]: Men had been here .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 5]: Was there a house ?
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 10]: Would he suddenly encounter some hermit Malay or Chinaman ?
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 21]: At the foot of the main cliff was a cluster of fruit-bearing trees , plantains , areca-nuts , and cocoa-palms .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 8]: A couple of cinchonas caught his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 11]: In one spot the undergrowth was rank and vividly green .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 26]: The cassava , or tapioca plant , reared its high , passion-flower leaves above the grass , and some sago-palms thrust aloft their thick-stemmed trunks .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 16]: `` Here is a change of menu , at any rate , '' he communed .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 15]: Breaking a thick branch off a poon tree he whittled away the minor stems .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 12]: A strong stick was needful to explore that leafy fastness thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 33]: A few cautious strides and vigorous whacks with the stick laid bare the cause of such prodigality in a soil covered with drifted sand and lumps of black and white speckled coral .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 26]: The trees and bushes enclosed a well -- safe-guarded it , in fact , from being choked with sand during the first gale that blew .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 36]: Delighted with this discovery , more precious than diamonds at the moment , for he doubted the advisability of existing on the water supply of the pitcher-plant , he knelt to peer into the excavation .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 7]: The well had been properly made .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 12]: Ten feet down he could see the reflection of his face .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 11]: Expert hands had tapped the secret reservoir of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 20]: By stretching to the full extent of his arm , he managed to plunge the stick into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 12]: Tasting the drops , he found that they were quite sweet .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: The sand and porous rock provided the best of filter-beds .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 34]: He rose , wall pleased , and noted that on the opposite side the appearance of the shrubs and tufts of long grass indicated the existence of a grown-over path towards the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 23]: He followed it , walking carelessly , with eyes seeking the prospect beyond , when something rattled and cracked beneath his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 15]: Looking down , he was horrified to find he was trampling on a skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 19]: Had a venomous snake coiled its glistening folds around his leg he would not have been more startled .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 9]: But this man of iron nerve soon recovered .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 9]: He frowned deeply after the first involuntary heart-throb .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 17]: With the stick he cleared away the undergrowth , and revealed the skeleton of a man .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 16]: The bones were big and strong , but oxidized by the action of the air .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 24]: Jenks had injured the left tibia by his tread , but three fractured ribs and a smashed shoulder-blade told some terrible unwritten story .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 10]: Beneath the mournful relics were fragments of decayed cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 5]: It was blue serge .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 15]: Lying about were a few blackened objects -- brass buttons marked with an anchor .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 25]: The dead man 's boots were in the best state of preservation , but the leather had shrunk and the nails protruded like fangs .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 36]: A rusted pocket-knife lay there , and on the left breast of the skeleton rested a round piece of tin , the top of a canister , which might have reposed in a coat pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 5]: Jenks picked it up .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: Some curious marks and figures were punched into its surface .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 13]: After a hasty glance he put it aside for more leisurely examination .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 5]: No weapon was visible .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 26]: He could form no estimate as to the cause of the death of this poor unknown , nor the time since the tragedy had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 15]: Jenks must have stood many minutes before he perceived that the skeleton was headless .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 17]: At first he imagined that in rummaging about with the stick he had disturbed the skull .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 37]: But the most minute search demonstrated that it had gone , had been taken away , in fact , for the plants which so effectually screened the lighter bones would not permit the skull to vanish .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 13]: Then the frown on the sailor 's face became threatening , thunderous .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 6]: He recollected the rusty kriss .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 15]: Indistinct memories of strange tales of the China Sea crowded unbidden to his brain .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 4]: `` Dyaks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 4]: he growled fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 17]: `` A ship 's officer , an Englishman probably , murdered by head-hunting Dyak pirates ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 9]: If they came once they would come again .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 9]: Five hundred yards away Iris Deane was sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 9]: He ought not to have left her alone .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 31]: And then , with the devilish ingenuity of coincidence , a revolver shot awoke the echoes , and sent all manner of wildfowl hurtling through the trees with clamorous outcry .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 19]: Panting and wild-eyed , Jenks was at the girl 's side in an inconceivably short space of time .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 35]: She was not beneath the shelter of the grove , but on the sands , gazing , pallid in cheek and lip , at the group of rocks on the edge of the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't know , '' she wailed brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 11]: `` I had a dream , such a horrible dream .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 11]: You were struggling with some awful thing down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 6]: She pointed to the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 13]: `` I was not near the place , '' he said laboriously .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 8]: It cost him an effort to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: His broad chest expanded inches with each respiration .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 9]: But I awoke and ran to save you .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 17]: When I got here I saw something , a thing with waving arms , and fired .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 9]: It vanished , and then you came . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: The sailor walked slowly to the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 13]: A fresh chip out of the stone showed where the bullet struck .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 15]: One huge boulder was wet , as if water had been splashed over it .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 9]: He halted and looked intently into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 28]: Not a fish was to be seen , but small spirals of sand were eddying up from the bottom , where it shelved steeply from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 4]: Iris followed him .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 8]: `` See , '' she cried excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 6]: `` I was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: There _ was _ something here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 15]: A creepy sensation ran up the man 's spine and passed behind his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: At this spot the drowned Lascars were lying .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 20]: Like an inspiration came the knowledge that the cuttlefish , the dreaded octopus , abounds in the China Sea .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 10]: His face was livid when he turned to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 14]: `` You are over-wrought by fatigue , Miss Deane , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 20]: `` What you saw was probably a seal ; '' he knew the ludicrous substitution would not be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: `` Please go and lie down again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: `` I can not , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 7]: `` I am too frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 3]: `` Frightened !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 4]: By a dream !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 5]: In broad daylight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 10]: `` But why are _ you _ so pale ?
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 6]: What has alarmed you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 5]: `` Can you ask ?
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 9]: Did you not give the agreed signal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 11]: `` Yes , but -- '' Her inquiring glance fell .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 9]: He was breathless from agitation rather than running .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 7]: He was perturbed on her account .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 10]: For an instant she had looked into his soul .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 19]: `` I will go back , '' she said quietly , `` though I would rather accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: What are you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 17]: `` Seeking a place to lay our heads , '' he answered , with gruff carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 9]: `` You really must rest , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 13]: Otherwise you will be broken up by fatigue and become ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 17]: So Iris again sought her couch of sand , and the sailor returned to the skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 15]: They separated unwillingly , each thinking only of the other 's safety and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 18]: The girl knew she was not wanted because the man wished to spare her some unpleasant experience .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 36]: She obeyed him with a sigh , and sat down , not to sleep , but to muse , as girls will , round-eyed , wistful , with the angelic fantasy of youth and innocence .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 18]: CHAPTER IV RAINBOW ISLAND Across the parched bones lay the stick discarded by Jenks in his alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 12]: He picked it up and resumed his progress along the pathway .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 15]: So closely did he now examine the ground that he hardly noted his direction .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 10]: The track led straight towards the wall of rock .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 10]: The distance was not great -- about forty yards .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 34]: At first the brushwood impeded him , but soon even this hindrance disappeared , and a well-defined passage meandered through a belt of trees , some strong and lofty , others quite immature .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 10]: More bushes gathered at the foot of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 41]: Behind them he could see the mouth of a cave ; the six months ' old growth of vegetation about the entrance gave clear indication as to the time which had elapsed since a human foot last disturbed the solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 15]: A few vigorous blows with the stick cleared away obstructing plants and leafy branches .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 18]: The sailor stooped and looked into the cavern , for the opening was barely five feet high .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 20]: He perceived instantly that the excavation was man 's handiwork , applied to a fault in the hard rock .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 16]: A sort of natural shaft existed , and this had been extended by manual labor .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 9]: Beyond the entrance the cave became more lofty .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 31]: Owing to its position with reference to the sun at that hour Jenks imagined that sufficient light would be obtainable when the tropical luxuriance of foliage outside was dispensed with .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 7]: At present the interior was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 10]: With the stick he tapped the walls and roof .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 20]: A startled cluck and the rush of wings heralded the flight of two birds , alarmed by the noise .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 35]: Soon his eyes , more accustomed to the gloom , made out that the place was about thirty feet deep , ten feet wide in the center , and seven or eight feet high .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 13]: At the further end was a collection of objects inviting prompt attention .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 9]: Each moment he could see with greater distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 41]: Kneeling on one side of the little pile he discerned that on a large stone , serving as a rude bench , were some tin utensils , some knives , a sextant , and a quantity of empty cartridge cases .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 20]: Between the stone and what a miner terms the `` face '' of the rock was a four-foot space .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 31]: Here , half imbedded in the sand which covered the floor , were two pickaxes , a shovel , a sledge-hammer , a fine timber-felling axe , and three crowbars .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 19]: In the darkest corner of the cave 's extremity the `` wall '' appeared to be very smooth .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 15]: He prodded with the stick , and there was a sharp clang of tin .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 10]: He discovered six square kerosene-oil cases carefully stacked up .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 19]: Three were empty , one seemed to be half full , and the contents of two were untouched .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 15]: With almost feverish haste he ascertained that the half-filled tin did really contain oil .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 6]: `` What a find ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 4]: he ejaculated aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 12]: Another pair of birds dashed from a ledge near the roof .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 5]: `` Confound you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 4]: shouted the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 17]: He sprang back and whacked the walls viciously , but all the feathered intruders had gone .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 13]: So far as he could judge the cave harbored no further surprises .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 14]: Returning towards the exit his boots dislodged more empty cartridges from the sand .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 11]: They were shells adapted to a revolver of heavy caliber .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 13]: At a short distance from the doorway they were present in dozens .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 11]: `` The remnants of a fight , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 11]: `` The man was attacked , and defended himself here .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 15]: Not expecting the arrival of enemies he provided no store of food or water .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 15]: He was killed whilst trying to reach the well , probably at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 32]: He vividly pictured the scene -- a brave , hardy European keeping at bay a boatload of Dyak savages , enduring manfully the agonies of hunger , thirst , perhaps wounds .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 36]: Then the siege , followed by a wild effort to gain the life-giving well , the hiss of a Malay parang wielded by a lurking foe , and the last despairing struggle before death came .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 5]: He might be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 8]: Perchance there was a less dramatic explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 11]: But he could not shake off his , first impressions .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: They were garnered from dumb evidence and developed by some occult but overwhelming sense of certainty .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 10]: `` What was the poor devil doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 19]: `` Why did he bury himself in this rock , with mining utensils and a few rough stores ?
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 7]: He could not be a castaway .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 48]: There is the indication of purpose , of preparation , of method combined with ignorance , for none who knew the ways of Dyaks and Chinese pirates would venture to live here alone , if he could help it , and if he really were alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 14]: The thing was a mystery , would probably remain a mystery for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 16]: `` Be it steel or be it lead , Anyhow the man is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: There was relief in hearing his own voice .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: He could hum , and think , and act .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 19]: Arming himself with the axe he attacked the bushes and branches of trees in front of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 17]: He cut a fresh approach to the well , and threw the litter over the skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 25]: At first he was inclined to bury it where it lay , but he disliked the idea of Iris walking unconsciously over the place .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 8]: No time could be wasted that day .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 11]: He would seize an early opportunity to act as grave-digger .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 14]: After an absence of little more than an hour he rejoined the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 16]: She saw him from afar , and wondered whence he obtained the axe he shouldered .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 15]: `` You are a successful explorer , '' she cried when he drew near .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: `` Yes , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 14]: I have found water , implements , a shelter , even light . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 12]: `` What sort of light -- spiritual , or material ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 4]: `` Oil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 22]: Iris could not remain serious for many consecutive minutes , but she gathered that he was in no mood for frivolity .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 11]: `` And the shelter -- is it a house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 3]: she continued .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 6]: `` No , a cave .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 13]: If you are sufficiently rested you might come and take possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: Her eyes danced with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: He told her what he had seen , with reservations , and she ran on before him to witness these marvels .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 13]: `` Why did you make a new path to the well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 7]: she inquired after a rapid survey .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 6]: `` A new path ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: The pertinent question staggered him .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 18]: `` Yes , the people who lived here must have had some sort of free passage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 4]: He lied easily .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 13]: `` I have only cleared away recent growth , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 9]: `` And why did they dig a cave ?
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 17]: It surely would be much more simple to build a house from all these trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 11]: `` There you puzzle me , '' he said frankly .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 14]: They had entered the cavern but a little way and now came out .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 7]: `` These empty cartridges are funny .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 9]: They suggest a fort , a battle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 16]: Woman-like , her words were carelessly chosen , but they were crammed with inductive force .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: Embarked on the toboggan slope of untruth the sailor slid smoothly downwards .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: `` Events have colored your imagination , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: Even in England men often preserve such things for future use .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 6]: They can be reloaded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 10]: `` Yes , I have seen keepers do that .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 4]: This is different .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 22]: There is an air of -- '' `` There is a lot to be done , '' broke in Jenks emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 22]: `` We must climb the hill and get back here in time to light another fire before the sun goes down .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 21]: I want to prop a canvas sheet in front of the cave , and try to devise a lamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: `` Must I sleep inside ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 3]: demanded Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 4]: Where else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 11]: There was a pause , a mere whiff of awkwardness .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 12]: `` I will mount guard outside , '' went on Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 18]: He was trying to improve the edge of the axe by grinding it on a soft stone .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 8]: The girl went into the cave again .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 6]: She was inquisitive , uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 17]: `` That arrangement -- '' she began , but ended in a sharp cry of terror .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 11]: The dispossessed birds had returned during the sailor 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 12]: `` I will kill them , '' he shouted in anger .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 5]: `` Please do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 12]: There has been enough of death in this place already . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 7]: The words jarred on his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 15]: Then he felt that she could only allude to the victims of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 19]: `` I was going to say , '' she explained , `` that we must devise a partition .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 14]: There is no help for it until you construct a sort of house .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 12]: Candidly , I do not like this hole in the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 9]: It is a vault , a tomb . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 17]: `` You told me that I was in command , yet you dispute my orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 21]: He strove hard to appear brusquely good-humored , indifferent , though for one of his mould he was absurdly irritable .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 11]: The cause was over-strain , but that explanation escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 4]: `` Quite true .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 25]: But if sleeping in the cold , in dew or rain , is bad for me , it must be equally bad for you .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 11]: And without you I am helpless , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 10]: His arms twitched to give her a reassuring hug .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: In some respects she was so childlike ; her big blue eyes were so ingenuous .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 14]: He laughed sardonically , and the harsh note clashed with her frank candor .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 10]: Here , at least , she was utterly deceived .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: His changeful moods were incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 19]: `` I will serve you to the best of my ability , Miss Deane , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 16]: `` We must hope for a speedy rescue , and I am inured to exposure .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 6]: It is otherwise with you .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 8]: Are you ready for the climb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 10]: Mechanically she picked up a stick at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: It was the sailor 's wand of investigation .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 14]: He snatched it from her hands and threw it away among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 11]: `` That is a dangerous alpenstock , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: `` The wood is unreliable .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 4]: It might break .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 19]: I will cut you a better one , '' and he swung the axe against a tall sapling .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 9]: Iris mentally described him as `` funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 38]: She followed him in the upward curve of the ascent , for the grade was not difficult and the ground smooth enough , the storms of years having pulverized the rock and driven sand into its clefts .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 11]: The persistent inroads of the trees had done the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 22]: Beyond the flight of birds and the scampering of some tiny monkeys overhead , they did not disturb a living creature .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 51]: The crest of the hill was tree-covered , and they could see nothing beyond their immediate locality until the sailor found a point higher than the rest , where a rugged collection of hard basalt and the uprooting of some poon trees provided an open space elevated above the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 9]: For a short distance the foothold was precarious .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 11]: Jenks helped the girl in this part of the climb .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 9]: His strong , gentle grasp gave her confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 17]: She was flushed with exertion when they stood together on the summit of this elevated perch .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 17]: They could look to every point of the compass except a small section on the south-west .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 15]: Here the trees rose behind them until the brow of the precipice was reached .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 18]: The emergence into a sunlit panorama of land and sea , though expected , was profoundly enthralling .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 17]: They appeared to stand almost exactly in the center of the island , which was crescent-shaped .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 10]: It was no larger than the sailor had estimated .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 31]: The new slopes now revealed were covered with verdure down to the very edge of the water , which , for nearly a mile seawards , broke over jagged reefs .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 9]: The sea looked strangely calm from this height .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 17]: Irregular blue patches on the horizon to south and east caught the man 's first glance .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 12]: He unslung the binoculars he still carried and focused them eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 4]: `` Islands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 11]: he cried , `` and big ones , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 5]: `` How odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 13]: whispered Iris , more concerned in the scrutiny of her immediate surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 6]: Jenks glanced at her sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 53]: She was not looking at the islands , but at a curious hollow , a quarry-like depression beneath them to the right , distant about three hundred yards and not far removed from the small plateau containing the well , though isolated from it by the south angle of the main cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 27]: Here , in a great circle , there was not a vestige of grass , shrub , or tree , nothing save brown rock and sand .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 16]: At first the sailor deemed it to be the dried-up bed of a small lake .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 14]: This hypothesis would not serve , else it would be choked with verdure .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 34]: The pit stared up at them like an ominous eye , though neither paid further attention to it , for the glorious prospect mapped at their feet momentarily swept aside all other considerations .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 7]: `` What a beautiful place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 3]: murmured Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 9]: `` I wonder what it is called . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 4]: `` Limbo . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 5]: The word came instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 13]: The sailor 's gaze was again fixed on those distant blue outlines .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 5]: Miss Deane was dissatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 7]: `` We are not dead yet .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: You must find a better name than that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: `` Well , suppose we christen it Rainbow Island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 7]: `` Why ` Rainbow ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 18]: `` That is the English meaning of ` Iris , ' in Latin , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 5]: `` So it is .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 9]: How clever of you to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 16]: Tell me , what is the meaning of ` Robert , ' in Greek ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 11]: He turned to survey the north-west side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 10]: `` I do not know , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 21]: `` It might not be far-fetched to translate it as ' a ship 's steward : a menial . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 13]: Miss Iris had meant her playful retort as a mere light-hearted quibble .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 18]: It annoyed her , a young person of much consequence , to have her kindly condescension repelled .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 34]: `` I suppose so , '' she agreed ; `` but I have gone through so much in a few hours that I am bewildered , apt to forget these nice distinctions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 8]: Where these two quareling , or flirting ?
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 4]: Who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 14]: Jenks was closely examining the reef on which the _ Sirdar _ struck .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 10]: Some square objects were visible near the palm tree .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 16]: The sun , glinting on the waves , rendered it difficult to discern their significance .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 9]: `` What do you make of those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 15]: he inquired , handing the glasses , and blandly ignoring Miss Deane 's petulance .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 17]: Her brain was busy with other things while she twisted the binoculars to suit her vision .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 11]: Rainbow Island -- Iris -- it was a nice conceit .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: But `` menial '' struck a discordant note .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 10]: This man was no menial in appearance or speech .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: Why was he so deliberately rude ?
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 13]: `` I think they are boxes or packing-cases , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 9]: `` Ah , that was my own idea .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 7]: I must visit that locality . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: Will you swim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 38]: `` No , '' he said , his stern lips relaxing in a smile , `` I will not swim ; and by the way , Miss Deane , be careful when you are near the water .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 9]: The lagoon is swarming with sharks at present .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 30]: I feel tolerably assured that at low tide , when the remnants of the gale have vanished , I will be able to walk there along the reef . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: `` Sharks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 4]: `` In there !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 9]: What horrible surprises this speck of land contains !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 14]: I should not have imagined that sharks and seals could live together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 14]: `` You are quite right , '' he explained , with becoming gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 14]: `` As a rule sharks infest only the leeward side of these islands .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 12]: Just now they are attracted in shoals by the wreck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 4]: `` Oh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 4]: Iris shivered slightly .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: `` We had better go back now .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 10]: The wind is keen here , Miss Deane . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 35]: -LSB- Illustration : HE WAS SO BUSY THAT HE PAID LITTLE HEED TO IRIS , BUT THE ODOR OF FRIED HAM WAS WAFTED TO HIM -RSB- She knew that he purposely misunderstood her gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: His attitude conveyed a rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 20]: There was no further room for sentiment in their present existence ; they had to deal with chill necessities .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 28]: As for the sailor , he was glad that the chance turn of their conversation enabled him to warn her against the lurking dangers of the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 18]: There was no need to mention the devil-fish now ; he must spare her all avoidable thrills .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 19]: They gathered the stores from the first _ al fresco _ dining-room and reached the cave without incident .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 19]: Another fire was lighted , and whilst Iris attended to the kitchen the sailor felled several young trees .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 13]: He wanted poles , and these were the right size and shape .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: He soon cleared a considerable space .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 18]: The timber was soft and so small in girth that three cuts with the axe usually sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 37]: He dragged from the beach the smallest tarpaulin he could find , and propped it against the rock in such manner that it effectually screened the mouth of the cave , though admitting light and air .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 12]: He was so busy that he paid little heed to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 11]: But the odor of fried ham was wafted to him .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 40]: He was lifting a couple of heavy stones to stay the canvas and keep it from flapping in the wind , when the girl called out -- `` Would n't you like to have a wash before dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 8]: He straightened himself and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 9]: Her face and hands were shining , spotless .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 12]: The change was so great that his brow wrinkled with perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 11]: `` I am a good pupil , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 11]: `` You see I am already learning to help myself .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: I made a bucket out of one of the dish-covers by slinging it in two ropes .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 15]: Another dish-cover , some sand and leaves supplied basin , soap , and towel .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 20]: I have cleaned the tin cups and the knives , and see , here is my greatest treasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 8]: She held up a small metal lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 11]: `` Where in the world did you find that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 10]: `` Buried in the sand inside the cave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 44]: His tone was abrupt She was so disappointed by the seeming want of appreciation of her industry that a gleam of amusement died from her eyes and she shook her head , stooping at once to attend to the toasting of some biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 7]: This time he was genuinely sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 12]: `` Forgive me , Miss Deane , '' he said penitently .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 8]: `` My words are dictated by anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 13]: I do not wish you to make discoveries on your own account .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 17]: This is a strange place , you know -- an unpleasant one in some respects . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 11]: `` Surely I can rummage about my own cave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 4]: `` Most certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 15]: It was careless of me not to have examined its interior more thoroughly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 13]: `` Then why do you grumble because I found the lamp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 9]: `` I did not mean any such thing .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 5]: I am sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: `` I think you are horrid .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 13]: If you want to wash you will find the water over there .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 4]: Do n't wait .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 10]: The ham will be frizzled to a cinder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 3]: Unlucky Jenks !
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 10]: Was ever man fated to incur such unmerited odium ?
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 8]: He savagely laved his face and neck .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: The fresh cool water was delightful at first , but it caused his injured nail to throb dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 15]: When he drew near to the fire he experienced an unaccountable sensation of weakness .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: Could it be possible that he was going to faint ?
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 5]: It was too absurd .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 6]: He sank to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 13]: Trees , rocks , and sand-strewn earth indulged in a mad dance .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 8]: Iris 's voice sounded weak and indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 11]: It seemed to travel in waves from a great distance .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 28]: He tried to brush away from his brain these dim fancies , but his iron will for once failed , and he pitched headlong downwards into darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 13]: When he recovered the girl 's left arm was round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 9]: For one blissful instant he nestled there contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 12]: He looked into her eyes and saw that she was crying .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 17]: A gust of anger rose within him that he should be the cause of those tears .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 4]: `` Damn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 8]: he said , and tried to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 5]: are you better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 5]: Her lips quivered pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 3]: What happened ?
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 5]: Did I faint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 5]: `` Drink this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 16]: She held a cup to his mouth and he obediently strove to swallow the contents .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 4]: It was champagne .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 32]: After the first spasm of terror , and when the application of water to his face failed to restore consciousness , Iris had knocked the head off the bottle of champagne .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 4]: He quickly revived .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 14]: Nature had only given him a warning that he was overdrawing his resources .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 5]: He was deeply humiliated .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 22]: He did not conceive the truth , that only a strong man could do all that he had done and live .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 8]: For thirty-six hours he had not slept .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 16]: During part of the time he fought with wilder beasts than they knew at Ephesus .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 69]: The long exposure to the sun , the mental strain of his foreboding that the charming girl whose life depended upon him might be exposed to even worse dangers than any yet encountered , the physical labor he had undergone , the irksome restraint he strove to place upon his conduct and utterances -- all these things culminated in utter relaxation when the water touched his heated skin .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 8]: But he was really very much annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 11]: A powerful man always is annoyed when forced to yield .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 11]: The revelation of a limit to human endurance infuriates him .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 16]: A woman invariably thinks that the man should be scolded , by way of tonic .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 11]: `` How _ could _ you frighten me so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 5]: demanded Iris , hysterically .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 12]: `` You must have felt that you were working too hard .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 5]: You made me rest .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 8]: Why did n't you rest yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 6]: He looked at her wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 11]: This collapse must not happen again , for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 9]: These two said more with eyes than lips .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 11]: She withdrew her arm ; her face and neck crimsoned .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 10]: `` There , '' she said with compelled cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 7]: `` You are all right now .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 5]: Finish the wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 5]: He emptied the tin .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 6]: It gave him new life .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 23]: `` I always thought , '' he answered gravely , `` that champagne was worth its weight in gold under certain conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 6]: These are the conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 34]: Iris reflected , with elastic rebound from despair to relief , that men in the lower ranks of life do not usually form theories on the expensive virtues of the wine of France .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: But her mind was suddenly occupied by a fresh disaster .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 7]: `` The ham is ruined . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: It was burnt black .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 6]: She prepared a fresh supply .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 10]: When it was ready , Jenks was himself again .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 13]: They ate in silence , and shared the remains of the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 18]: The man idly wondered what was the _ plat du jour _ at the Savoy that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 28]: He remembered that the last time he was there he had called for _ Jambon de York aux épinards _ and half a pint of Heidseck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 16]: _ Coelum non animum mutant , qui trans mare currant _ , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 20]: By a queer trick of memory he could recall the very page in Horace where this philosophical line occurs .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 11]: It was in the eleventh epistle of the first book .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 7]: A smile illumined his tired face .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 4]: Iris was watchful .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 15]: She had never in her life cooked even a potato or boiled an egg .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 7]: The ham was her first attempt .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 7]: `` My cooking amuses you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 4]: she demanded suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 10]: `` It gratifies every sense , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 13]: `` There is but one thing needful to complete my happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 6]: `` And that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 6]: `` Permission to smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 5]: `` Smoke what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 32]: He produced a steel box , tightly closed , and a pipe , `` I will answer you in Byron 's words , '' he said -- '' ` Sublime tobacco !
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 18]: which from east to west Cheers the tar 's labour or the Turkman 's rest . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 19]: `` Your pockets are absolute shops , '' said the girl , delighted that his temper had improved .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 12]: `` What other stores do you carry about with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 14]: He lit his pipe and solemnly gave an inventory of his worldly goods .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 28]: Beyond the items she had previously seen he could only enumerate a silver dollar , a very soiled and crumpled handkerchief , and a bit of tin .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 16]: A box of Norwegian matches he threw away as useless , but Iris recovered them .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 14]: `` You never know what purpose they may serve , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 13]: In after days a weird significance was attached to this simple phrase .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 12]: `` Why do you carry about a bit of tin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 4]: she went on .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 9]: How the atmosphere of deception clung to him !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 25]: Here was a man compelled to lie outrageously who , in happier years , had prided himself on scrupulous accuracy even in small things .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 6]: `` Plague upon it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 4]: he silently protested .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 18]: `` Subterfuge and deceit are as much at home in this deserted island as in Mayfair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 13]: `` I found it here , Miss Deane , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 12]: Luckily she interpreted `` here '' as applying to the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 6]: `` Let me see it .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 4]: May I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 6]: He handed it to her .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 14]: She could make nothing of it , so together they puzzled over it .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 12]: The sailor rubbed it with a mixture of kerosene and sand .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 12]: Then figures and letters and a sort of diagram were revealed .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 6]: At last they became decipherable .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 28]: By exercising patient ingenuity some one had indented the metal with a sharp punch until the marks assumed this aspect -LRB- see cut , following page -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 4]: Iris was quick-witted .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 13]: `` It is a plan of the island , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: `` Also the latitude and the longitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 9]: `` What does ` J.S. ' mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 20]: `` Probably the initials of a man 's name ; let us say John Smith , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 18]: `` And the figures on the island , with the ` X ' and the dot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 13]: `` I can not tell you at present , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 24]: `` I take it that the line across the island signifies this gap or canyon , and the small intersecting line the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 18]: But 32 divided by 1 , and an ` X ' surmounted by a dot are cabalistic .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 13]: They would cause even Sherlock Holmes to smoke at least two pipes .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: I have barely started one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 18]: -LSB- Illustration -RSB- She ran to fetch a glowing stick to enable him to relight his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 12]: `` Why do you give me such nasty little digs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 16]: `` You need not have stopped smoking just because I stood close to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 14]: `` Really , Miss Deane -- '' `` There , do n't protest .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 8]: I like the smell of that tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 16]: I thought sailors invariably smoked rank , black stuff which they call thick twist . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 10]: `` I am a beginner , as a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 16]: After a few more years before the mast I may hope to reach perfection . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 8]: Their eyes exchanged a quaintly pleasant challenge .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 22]: Thus the man -- `` She is determined to learn something of my past , but she will not succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: And the woman -- `` The wretch !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 7]: He is close as an oyster .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 16]: But I will make him open his mouth , see if I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 8]: She reverted to the piece of tin .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 21]: `` It looks quite mysterious , like the things you read of in stories of pirates and buried treasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 29]: `` It is unquestionably a plan , a guidance , given to a person not previously acquainted with the island but cognizant of some fact connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 14]: Unfortunately none of the buccaneers I can bring to mind frequented these seas .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 20]: The poor beggar who left it here must have had some other motive than searching for a cache . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 14]: `` Did he dig the cave and the well , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: `` Probably the former , but not the well .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 8]: No man could do it unaided . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 10]: `` Why do you assume he was alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 11]: He strolled towards the fire to kick a stray log .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 17]: `` It is only idle speculation at the best , Miss Deane , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 16]: `` Would you like to help me to drag some timber up from the beach ?
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 18]: If we get a few big planks we can build a fire that will last for hours .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: We want some extra clothes , too , and it will soon be dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: The request for co-operation gratified her .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 20]: She complied eagerly , and without much exertion they hauled a respectable load of firewood to their new camping-ground .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 12]: They also brought a number of coats to serve as coverings .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 6]: Then Jenks tackled the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 20]: Between the rust and the soreness of his index finger it was a most difficult operation to open it .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 23]: Before the sun went down he succeeded , and made a wick by unraveling a few strands of wool from his jersey .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 20]: When night fell , with the suddenness of the tropics , Iris was able to illuminate her small domain .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 12]: They were both utterly tired and ready to drop with fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 16]: The girl said `` Good night , '' but instantly reappeared from behind the tarpaulin .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: `` Am I to keep the lamp alight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 7]: `` Please yourself , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 5]: Better not , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 13]: It will only burn four or five hours , any way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 23]: Soon the light vanished , and he lay down , his pipe between his teeth , close to the cave 's entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 11]: Weary though he was , he could not sleep forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: His mind was occupied with the signs on the canister head .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 20]: `` 32 divided by 1 ; an ` X ' and a dot , '' he repeated several times .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 7]: `` What do they signify ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 15]: Suddenly he sat up , with every sense alert , and grabbed his revolver .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 20]: Something impelled him to look towards the spot , a few feet away , where the skeleton was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 16]: It was the rustling of a bird among the trees that had caught his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 24]: He thought of the white framework of a once powerful man , lying there among the bushes , abandoned , forgotten , horrific .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 8]: Then he smothered a cry of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 10]: `` There is no ` X ' and dot .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 10]: That sign is meant for a skull and cross-bones .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 18]: It lies exactly on the part of the island where we saw that queer-looking bald patch today .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 16]: First thing tomorrow , before the girl awakes , I must examine that place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 20]: He resolutely stretched himself on his share of the spread-out coats , now thoroughly dried by sun and fire .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 8]: In a minute he was sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 17]: CHAPTER V IRIS TO THE RESCUE `` Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 5]: -- _ Milton _ .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 11]: He awoke to find the sun high in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 29]: Iris was preparing breakfast ; a fine fire was crackling cheerfully , and the presiding goddess had so altered her appearance that the sailor surveyed her with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 16]: He noiselessly assumed a sitting posture , tucked his feet beneath him , and blinked .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 25]: The girl 's face was not visible from where he sat , and for a few seconds he thought he must surely be dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 12]: She was attired in a neat navy-blue dress and smart blouse .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 11]: Her white canvas shoes were replaced by strong leather boots .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 11]: She was quite spick and span , this island Hebe .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 12]: So soundly had he slept that his senses returned but slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 8]: At last he guessed what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 37]: She had risen with the dawn , and , conquering her natural feeling of repulsion , selected from the store he accumulated yesterday some more suitable garments than those in which she escaped from the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 22]: He quietly took stock of his own tattered condition , and passed a reflective hand over the stubble on his chin .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 11]: In a few days his face would resemble a scrubbing-brush .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 22]: In that mournful moment he would have exchanged even his pipe and tobacco-box -- worth untold gold -- for shaving tackle .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 10]: Who can say why his thoughts took such trend ?
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 16]: Twenty-four hours can effect great changes in the human mind if controlling influences are active .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 8]: Then came a sharp revulsion of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 8]: His name was Robert -- a menial .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 11]: He reached for his boots , and Iris heard him .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 11]: `` Good morning , '' she cried , smiling sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 8]: `` I thought you would never awake .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 9]: I suppose you were very , very tired .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 18]: You were lying so still that I ventured to peep at you a long time ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 13]: `` Thus might Titania peep at an ogre , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 11]: `` You did n't look a bit like an ogre .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 4]: You never do .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 11]: You only try to talk like one -- sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 9]: `` I claim a truce until after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 45]: If my rough compliment offends you , let me depend upon a more gentle tongue than my own -- '' ` Her Angel 's face As the great eye of heaven , shyned bright , And made a sunshine in the shady place . '
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 7]: `` Those lines are surely appropriate .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 10]: They come from the _ Faerie Queene _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 11]: `` They are very nice , but please wash quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 7]: The eggs will be hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 4]: `` Eggs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 11]: `` Yes ; I made a collection among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 10]: I tasted one of a lot that looked good .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: It was first-rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 14]: He had not the moral courage to begin the day with a rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 13]: She was irrepressible , but she really must not do these things .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 15]: He smothered a sigh in the improvised basin which was placed ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 8]: Miss Deane had prepared a capital meal .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 28]: Of course the ham and biscuits still bulked large in the bill of fare , but there were boiled eggs , fried bananas and an elderly cocoanut .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 25]: These things , supplemented by clear cold water , were not so bad for a couple of castaways , hundreds of miles from everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 20]: For the life of him the man could not refrain from displaying the conversational art in which he excelled .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 10]: Their talk dealt with Italy , Egypt , India .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 10]: He spoke with the ease of culture and enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 27]: Once he slipped into anecdote _ à propos _ of the helplessness of British soldiers in any matter outside the scope of the King 's Regulations .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 36]: `` I remember , '' he said , `` seeing a cavalry subaltern and the members of an escort sitting , half starved , on a number of bags piled up in the Suakin desert .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 11]: And what do you think were in the bags ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 15]: `` I do n't know , '' said Iris , keenly alert for deductions .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 3]: `` Biscuits !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 13]: They thought the bags contained patent fodder until I enlightened them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 28]: It was on the tip of her tongue to pounce on him with the comment : `` Then you have been an officer in the army . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 4]: But she forbore .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 6]: She had guessed this earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 10]: Yet the mischievous light in her eyes defied control .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 11]: He was warned in time and pulled himself up short .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 21]: `` You read my face like a book , '' she cried , with a delightful little _ moue _ .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 11]: `` No printed page was ever so -- legible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 14]: He was going to say `` fascinating , '' but checked the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 19]: He went on with brisk affectation -- `` Now , Miss Deane , we have gossiped too long .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 22]: I am a laggard this morning ; but before starting work , I have a few serious remarks to make . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: `` More digs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 4]: she inquired saucily .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 7]: `` I repudiate ` digs . '
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 18]: In the first place , you must not make any more experiments in the matter of food .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 19]: The eggs were a wonderful effort , but , flattered by success , you may poison yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 4]: `` Secondly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 25]: `` You must never pass out of my sight without carrying a revolver , not so much for defence , but as a signal .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 13]: Did you take one when you went bird 's - nesting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 36]: There was a troubled look in his eyes when he answered -- `` It is best to tell you at once that before help reaches us we may be visited by cruel and blood-thirsty savages .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 13]: I would not even mention this if it were a remote contingency .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 15]: As matters stand , you ought to know that such a thing may happen .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 13]: Let us trust in God 's goodness that assistance may come soon .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 19]: The island has seemingly been deserted for many months , and therein lies our best chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 15]: But I am obliged to warn you lest you should be taken unawares . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: Iris was serious enough now .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 12]: `` How do you know that such danger threatens us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 4]: He countered readily .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 22]: `` Because I happen to have read a good deal about the China Sea and its frequenters , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 14]: `` I am the last man in the world to alarm you needlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 22]: All I mean to convey is that certain precautions should be taken against a risk that is possible , not probable .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 4]: No more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 7]: She could not repress a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 21]: The aspect of nature was so beneficent that evil deeds seemed to be out of place in that fair isle .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 6]: Birds were singing around them .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 9]: The sun was mounting into a cloudless sky .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 24]: The gale had passed away into a pleasant breeze , and the sea was now rippling against the distant reef with peaceful melody .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 30]: The sailor wanted to tell her that he would defend her against a host of savages if he were endowed with many lives , but he was perforce tongue-tied .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 31]: He even reviled himself for having spoken , but she saw the anguish in his face , and her woman 's heart acknowledged him as her protector , her shield .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: `` Mr. Jenks , '' she said simply , `` we are in God 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 11]: I put my trust in Him , and in you .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 9]: I am hopeful , nay more , confident .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 16]: I thank you for what you have done , for all that you will do .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 30]: If you can not preserve me from threatening perils no man could , for you are as brave and gallant a gentleman as lives on the earth today . ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 37]: Now , the strange feature of this extraordinary and unexpected outburst of pent-up emotion was that the girl pronounced his name with the slightly emphasized accentuation of one who knew it to be a mere disguise .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 31]: The man was so taken aback by her declaration of faith that the minor incident , though it did not escape him , was smothered in a tumult of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 8]: He could not trust himself to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 22]: He rose hastily and seized the axe to deliver a murderous assault upon a sago palm that stood close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 11]: Iris was the first to recover a degree of self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 9]: For a moment she had bared her soul .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 7]: With reaction came a sensitive shrinking .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 16]: Her British temperament , no less than her delicate nature , disapproved these sentimental displays .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: She wanted to box her own ears .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 15]: With innate tact she took a keen interest in the felling of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 9]: `` What do you want it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 11]: she inquired , when the sturdy trunk creaked and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 5]: Jenks felt better now .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 12]: `` This is a change of diet , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 14]: `` No ; we do n't boil the leaves or nibble the bark .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 17]: When I split this palm open you will find that the interior is full of pith .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 39]: I will cut it out for you , and then it will be your task to knead it with water after well washing it , pick out all the fiber , and finally permit the water to evaporate .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 22]: In a couple of days the residuum will become a white powder , which , when boiled , is sago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 3]: said Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 13]: `` The story sounds unconvincing , but I believe I am correct .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 7]: It is worth a trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 17]: `` I should have imagined that sago grew on a stalk like rice or wheat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 5]: `` Or Topsy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 9]: A difficult situation had passed without undue effort .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 6]: Unhappily the man reopened it .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 17]: Whilst using a crowbar as a wedge he endeavored to put matters on a straightforward footing .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 25]: `` A little while ago , '' he said , `` you seemed to imply that I had assumed the name of Jenks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 9]: But Miss Deane 's confidential mood had gone .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 12]: `` Nothing of the kind , '' she said , coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 10]: `` I think Jenks is an excellent name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 12]: She regretted the words even as they fell from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 18]: The sailor gave a mighty wrench with the bar , splitting the log to its clustering leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: `` You are right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 9]: `` It is distinctive , brief , dogmatic .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 7]: I cling to it passionately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 30]: Soon afterwards , leaving Iris to the manufacture of sago , he went to the leeward side of the island , a search for turtles being his ostensible object .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 31]: When the trees hid him he quickened his pace and turned to the left , in order to explore the cavity marked on the tin with a skull and cross-bones .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 62]: To his surprise he hit upon the remnants of a roadway -- that is , a line through the wood where there were no well-grown trees , where the ground bore traces of humanity in the shape of a wrinkled and mildewed pair of Chinese boots , a wooden sandal , even the decayed remains of a palki , or litter .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 21]: At last he reached the edge of the pit , and the sight that met his eyes held him spellbound .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 21]: The labor of many hands had torn a chasm , a quarry , out of the side of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 34]: Roughly circular in shape , it had a diameter of perhaps a hundred feet , and at its deepest part , towards the cliff , it ran to a depth of forty feet .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 18]: On the lower side , where the sailor stood , it descended rapidly for some fifteen feet .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 38]: Grasses , shrubs , plants of every variety , grew in profusion down the steep slopes , wherever seeds could find precarious nurture , until a point was reached about ten or eleven feet from the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 13]: There all vegetation ceased as if forbidden to cross a magic circle .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 9]: Below this belt the place was a charnel-house .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 11]: The bones of men and animals mingled in weird confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 5]: Most were mere skeletons .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 16]: A few bodies -- nine the sailor counted -- yet preserved some resemblance of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 9]: These latter were scattered among the older relics .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 7]: They wore the clothes of Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 8]: Characteristic hats and weapons denoted their nationality .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 17]: The others , the first harvest of this modern Golgotha , might have been Chinese coolies .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 24]: When the sailor 's fascinated vision could register details he distinguished yokes , baskets , odd-looking spades and picks strewed amidst the bones .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 17]: The animals were all of one type , small , lanky , with long pointed skulls .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 8]: At last he spied a withered hoof .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 4]: They were pigs .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 23]: Over all lay a thick coating of fine sand , deposited from the eddying winds that could never reach the silent depths .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 8]: The place was gruesome , horribly depressing .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 8]: Jenks broke out into a clammy perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: He seemed to be looking at the secrets of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 8]: At last his superior intelligence asserted itself .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 11]: His brain became clearer , recovered its power of analysis .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 30]: He began to criticize , reflect , and this is the theory he evolved -- Some one , long ago , had discovered valuable minerals in the volcanic rock .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 40]: Mining operations were in full blast when the extinct volcano took its revenge upon the human ants gnawing at its vitals and smothered them by a deadly outpouring of carbonic acid gas , the bottled-up poison of the ages .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 32]: A horde of pigs , running wild over the island -- placed there , no doubt , by Chinese fishers -- had met the same fate whilst intent on dreadful orgy .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 28]: Then there came a European , who knew how the anhydrate gas , being heavier than the surrounding air , settled like water in that terrible hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 21]: He , too , had striven to wrest the treasure from the stone by driving a tunnel into the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 27]: He had partly succeeded and had gone away , perhaps to obtain help , after crudely registering his knowledge on the lid of a tin canister .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 36]: This , again , probably fell into the hands of another man , who , curious but unconvinced , caused himself to be set ashore on this desolate spot , with a few inadequate stores .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 13]: Possibly he had arranged to be taken off within a fixed time .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 38]: But a sampan , laden with Dyak pirates , came first , and the intrepid explorer 's bones rested near the well , whilst his head had gone to decorate the hut of some fierce village chief .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 25]: The murderers , after burying their own dead -- for the white man fought hard , witness the empty cartridges -- searched the island .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 12]: Some of them , ignorantly inquisitive , descended into the hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 4]: They remained there .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 33]: The others , superstitious barbarians , fled for their lives , embarking so hastily that they took from the cave neither tools nor oil , though they would greatly prize these articles .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 15]: Such was the tragic web he spun , a compound of fact and fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 7]: It explained all perplexities save one .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 10]: What did `` 32 divided by 1 '' mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 9]: Was there yet another fearsome riddle awaiting solution ?
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: And then his thoughts flew to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 14]: Happen what might , her bright picture was seldom absent from his brain .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 13]: Suppose , egg-hunting , she had stumbled across this Valley of Death !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 11]: How could he hope to keep it hidden from her ?
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 32]: Was not the ghastly knowledge better than the horror of a chance ramble through the wood and the shock of discovery , nay , indeed , the risk of a catastrophe ?
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 19]: He was a man who relieved his surcharged feelings with strong language -- a habit of recent acquisition .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 9]: He indulged in it now and felt better .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 25]: He rushed back through the trees until he caught sight of Iris industriously kneading the sago pith in one of those most useful dish-covers .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 31]: He called to her , led her wondering to the track , and pointed out the fatal quarry , but in such wise that she could not look inside it .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 14]: `` You remember that round hole we saw from the summit rock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 19]: `` Well , it is full of carbonic acid gas , to breathe which means unconsciousness and death .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 8]: It gives no warning to the inexperienced .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: It is rather pleasant than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 12]: Promise me you will never come near this place again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 11]: Now , Iris , too , had been thinking deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 8]: Robert Jenks bulked large in her day-dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 8]: Her nerves were not yet quite normal .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 19]: There was a catch in her throat as she answered -- `` I do n't want to die .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 7]: Of course I will keep away .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 7]: What a horrid island this is !
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 8]: Yet it might be a paradise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 28]: She bit her lip to suppress her tears , but , being the Eve in this garden , she continued -- `` How did you find out ?
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 10]: Is there anything -- nasty -- in there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 12]: `` Yes , the remains of animals , and other things .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: I would not have told you were it not imperative . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 10]: `` Are you keeping other secrets from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 8]: `` Oh , quite a number . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 14]: He managed to conjure up a smile , and the ruse was effective .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 9]: She applied the words to his past history .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 15]: `` I hope they will not be revealed so dramatically , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 10]: `` You never can tell , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 8]: They were in prophetic vein that morning .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 8]: They returned in silence to the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 11]: `` I wish to go inside , with a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 4]: May I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 16]: He had an odd trick of blushing , this bronzed man with a gnarled soul .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 16]: He could not frame a satisfactory reply , but busied himself in refilling the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 7]: `` May I come too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 21]: He flung aside the temptation to answer her in kind , merely assenting , with an explanation of his design .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 19]: When the lamp was in order he held it close to the wall and conducted a systematic survey .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 21]: The geological fault which favored the construction of the tunnel seemed to diverge to the left at the further end .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: The `` face '' of the rock exhibited the marks of persistent labor .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 19]: The stone had been hewn away by main force when the dislocation of strata ceased to be helpful .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 25]: His knowledge was limited on the subject , yet Jenks believed that the material here was a hard limestone rather than the external basalt .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 16]: Searching each inch with the feeble light , he paused once , with an exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 3]: cried Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 13]: `` I can not be certain , '' he said , doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: `` Would you mind holding the lamp whilst I use a crowbar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 14]: In the stone was visible a thin vein , bluish white in color .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 17]: He managed to break off a fair-sized lump containing a well-defined specimen of the foreign metal .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 14]: They hurried into the open air and examined the fragment with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 25]: The sailor picked it with his knife , and the substance in the vein came off in laminated layers , small , brittle scales .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 6]: `` Is it silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 5]: Iris was almost excited .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 7]: `` I do not think so .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 38]: I am no expert , but I have a vague idea -- I have seen -- '' He wrinkled his brows and pressed away the furrows with his hand , that physical habit of his when perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: `` I have it , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 6]: `` It is antimony . ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 8]: Miss Deane pursed her lips in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 2]: Antimony !
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 4]: What was antimony ?
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 11]: `` So much fuss for nothing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 13]: `` It is used in alloys and medicines , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 8]: `` To us it is useless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 11]: He threw the piece of rock contemptuously among the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 21]: But , being thorough in all that he undertook , he returned to the cave and again conducted an inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 22]: The silver-hued vein became more strongly marked at the point where it disappeared downwards into a collection of rubble and sand .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 12]: Did men give their toil , their lives , for this ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: So it would appear .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 13]: Be that as it might , he had a more pressing work .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 12]: If the cave still held a secret it must remain there .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 8]: Iris had gone back to her sago-kneading .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 8]: Necessity had made the lady a bread-maid .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 14]: `` Fifteen hundred years of philology bridged by circumstance , '' mused Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 12]: `` How Max Müller would have reveled in the incident ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 9]: Shouldering the axe he walked to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 29]: The tide was low and the circular sweep of the reef showed up irregularly , its black outlines sticking out of the vividly green water like jagged teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 11]: Much débris from the steamer was lying high and dry .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 25]: It was an easy task for an athletic man to reach the palm tree , yet the sailor hesitated , with almost imperceptible qualms .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 9]: `` A baited rat-trap , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 6]: Then he quickened his pace .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 14]: With the first active spring from rock to rock his unacknowledged doubts vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: He might find stores of priceless utility .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 5]: The reflection inspired him .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 16]: Jumping and climbing like a cat , in two minutes he was near the tree .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 16]: He could now see the true explanation of its growth in a seemingly impossible place .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 35]: Here the bed of the sea bulged upwards in a small sand cay , which silted round the base of a limestone rock , so different in color and formation from the coral reef .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 46]: Nature , whose engineering contrivances can force springs to mountain tops , managed to deliver to this isolated refuge a sufficient supply of water to nourish the palm , and the roots , firmly lodged in deep crevices , were well protected from the waves .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 14]: Between the sailor and the tree intervened a small stretch of shallow water .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 10]: Landward this submerged saddle shelved steeply into the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 18]: Although the water in the cove was twenty fathoms in depth , its crystal clearness was remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 17]: The bottom , composed of marvelously white sand and broken coral , rendered other objects conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 47]: He could see plenty of fish , but not a single shark , whilst on the inner slope of the reef was plainly visible the destroyed fore part of the _ Sirdar _ , which had struck beyond the tree , relatively to his present standpoint .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 10]: He had wondered why no boats were cast ashore .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 6]: Now he saw the reason .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 16]: Three of them were still fastened to the davits and carried down with the hull .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 8]: Seaward the water was not so clear .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 17]: The waves created patches of foam , and long submarine plants swayed gently in the undercurrent .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 26]: To reach Palm-tree Rock -- anticipating its subsequent name -- he must cross a space of some thirty feet and wade up to his waist .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: He made the passage with ease .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 34]: Pitched against the hole of the tree was a long narrow case , very heavy , iron-clamped ; and marked with letters in black triangles and the broad arrow of the British Government .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 9]: `` Rifles , by all the gods ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 4]: shouted the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 27]: They were really by the Enfield Small Arms Manufactory , but his glee at this stroke of luck might be held to excuse a verbal inaccuracy .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 17]: The _ Sirdar _ carried a consignment of arms and ammunition from Hong Kong to Singapore .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 20]: Providence had decreed that a practically inexhaustible store of cartridges should be hurled across the lagoon to the island .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 11]: And here were Lee-Metfords enough to equip half a company .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 15]: He would not risk the precious axe in an attempt to open the case .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: He must go back for a crowbar .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 16]: What else was there in this storehouse , thrust by Neptune from the ocean bed ?
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 8]: A chest of tea , seemingly undamaged .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 8]: Three barrels of flour , utterly ruined .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: A saloon chair , smashed from its pivot .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 4]: A battered chronometer .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 15]: For the rest , fragments of timber intermingled with pulverized coral and broken crockery .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 16]: A little further on , the deep-water entrance to the lagoon curved between sunken rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 13]: On one of them rested the _ Sirdar 's _ huge funnel .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 9]: The north-west section of the reef was bare .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 14]: Among the wreckage he found a coil of stout rope and a pulley .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 23]: He instantly conceived the idea of constructing an aerial line to ferry the chest of tea across the channel he had forded .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 28]: He threaded the pulley with the rope and climbed the tree , adding a touch of artistic completeness to the ruin of his trousers by the operation .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 35]: He had fastened the pulley high up the trunk before he realized how much more simple it would be to break open the chest where it lay and transport its contents in small parcels .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 4]: He laughed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 12]: `` I am becoming addleheaded , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 18]: `` Anyhow , now the job is done I may as well make use of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 12]: Recoiling the rope-ends , he cast them across to the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 12]: In such small ways do men throw invisible dice with death .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 19]: With those two lines he would , within a few fleeting seconds , drag himself back from eternity .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 37]: Picking up the axe , he carelessly stepped into the water , not knowing that Iris , having welded the incipient sago into a flat pancake , had strolled to the beach and was watching him .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 17]: The water was hardly above his knees when there came a swirling rush from the seaweed .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 14]: A long tentacle shot out like a lasso and gripped his right leg .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 6]: Another coiled round his waist .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 14]: he gurgled , as a horrid sucker closed over his mouth and nose .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: He was in the grip of a devil-fish .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 29]: A deadly sensation of nausea almost overpowered him , but the love of life came to his aid , and he tore the suffocating feeler from his face .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 20]: Then the axe whirled , and one of the eight arms of the octopus lost some of its length .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 10]: Yet a fourth flung itself around his left ankle .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 40]: A few feet away , out of range of the axe , and lifting itself bodily out of the water , was the dread form of the cuttle , apparently all head , with distended gills and monstrous eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 9]: The sailor 's feet were planted wide apart .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 34]: With frenzied effort he hacked at the murderous tentacles , but the water hindered him , and he was forced to lean back , in superhuman strain , to avoid losing his balance .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 14]: If once this terrible assailant got him down he knew he was lost .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 17]: The very need to keep his feet prevented him from attempting to deal a mortal blow .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 10]: The cuttle was anchored by three of its tentacles .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 17]: Its remaining arm darted with sinuous activity to again clutch the man 's face or neck .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 26]: With the axe he smote madly at the curling feeler , diverting its aim time and again , but failing to deliver an effective stroke .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 11]: With agonized prescience the sailor knew that he was yielding .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 17]: Were the devil-fish a giant of its tribe he could not have held out so long .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 29]: As it was , the creature could afford to wait , strengthening its grasp , tightening its coils , pulling and pumping at its prey with remorseless certainty .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 5]: He was nearly spent .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 27]: In a paroxysm of despair he resolved to give way , and with one mad effort seek to bury the axe in the monster 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 31]: But ere he could execute this fatal project -- for the cuttle would have instantly swept him into the trailing weeds -- five revolver shots rang out in quick succession .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 7]: Iris had reached the nearest rock .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 10]: The third bullet gave the octopus cause to reflect .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 9]: It squirted forth a torrent of dark-colored fluid .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 8]: Instantly the water became black , opaque .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 22]: The tentacle flourishing in air thrashed the surface with impotent fury ; that around Jenks 's waist grew taut and rigid .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 9]: The axe flashed with the inspiration of hope .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 14]: Another arm was severed ; the huge dismembered coil slackened and fell away .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 6]: Yet was he anchored immovably .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 7]: He turned to look at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 10]: She never forgot the fleeting expression of his face .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 9]: So might Lazarus have looked from the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 5]: `` The rope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 16]: she screamed , dropping the revolver and seizing the loose ends lying at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 14]: She drew them tight and leaned back , pulling with all her strength .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 14]: The sailor flung the axe to the rocks and grasped the two ropes .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 7]: He raised himself and plunged wildly .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 4]: He was free .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 12]: With two convulsive strides he was at the girl 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 11]: He stumbled to a boulder and dropped in complete collapse .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 14]: After a time he felt Iris 's hand placed timidly on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 10]: He raised his head and saw her eyes shining .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 7]: `` We are quits now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 20]: CHAPTER VI SOME EXPLANATIONS Fierce emotions are necessarily transient , but for the hour they exhaust the psychic capacity .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 24]: The sailor had gone through such mental stress before it was yet noon that he was benumbed , wholly incapable of further sensation .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 25]: Seneca tells how the island of Theresæa arose in a moment from the sea , thereby astounding ancient mariners , as well it might .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 29]: Had this manifestation been repeated within a cable 's length from the reef , Jenks was in mood to accept it as befitting the new order of things .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 12]: Being in good condition , he soon recovered his physical powers .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 13]: He was outwardly little the worse for the encounter with the devil-fish .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 8]: The skin around his mouth was sore .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 7]: His waist and legs were bruised .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 21]: One sweep of the axe had cut clean through the bulging leather of his left boot without touching the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 9]: In a word , he was practically uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 15]: He had the doglike habit of shaking himself at the close of a fray .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 9]: He did so now when he stood up .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 8]: Iris showed clearer signs of the ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 14]: Her face was drawn and haggard , the pupils of her eyes dilated .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 10]: She was gazing into depths , illimitable , unexplored .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 7]: Compassion awoke at sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 9]: `` Come , '' said Jenks , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 10]: `` Let us get back to the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 24]: He quietly resumed predominance , helping her over the rough pathway of the reef , almost lifting her when the difficulties were great .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 17]: He did not ask her how it happened that she came so speedily to his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 13]: Enough that she had done it , daring all for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 6]: She was weak and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 29]: With the acute vision of the soul she saw again , and yet again , the deadly malice of the octopus , the divine despair of the man .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 10]: Reaching the firm sand , she could walk alone .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 3]: She limped .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 10]: Instantly her companion 's blunted emotions quickened into life .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 17]: He caught her arm and said hoarsely -- `` Are you hurt in any way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 8]: The question brought her back from dreamland .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 10]: A waking nightmare was happily shattered into dim fragments .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 7]: She even strove to smile unconcernedly .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 9]: `` It is nothing , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: `` I stumbled on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 5]: There is no sprain .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 16]: Merely a blow , a bit of skin rubbed off , above my ankle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 7]: `` Let me carry you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 4]: `` The idea !
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 3]: Carry me !
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 9]: I will race you to the cave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: It was no idle jest .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 17]: She wanted to run -- to get away from that inky blotch in the green water .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 10]: `` You are sure it is a trifle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 4]: `` Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 10]: My stocking chafes a little ; that is all .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 8]: See , I will show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: She stooped , and with the quick skill of woman , rolled down the stocking on her right leg .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: Modestly daring , she stretched out her foot and slightly lifted her dress .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 19]: On the outer side of the tapering limb was an ugly bruise , scratched deeply by the coral .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 6]: He exhibited due surgical interest .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 9]: His manner , his words , became professional .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 12]: `` We will soon put that right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 19]: `` A strip off your muslin dress , soaked in brandy , will -- '' `` Brandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 10]: `` Yes ; we have some , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 9]: Brandy is a great tip for bruised wounds .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 12]: It can be applied both ways , inside and out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 4]: This was better .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: They were steadily drifting back to the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 17]: Whilst she stitched together some muslin strips he knocked the head off a bottle of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 18]: They each drank a small quantity , and the generous spirit brought color to their wan cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 21]: The sailor showed Iris how to fasten a bandage by twisting the muslin round the upper part of his boot .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: For the first time she saw the cut made by the axe .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 11]: `` Did -- the thing -- grip you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 4]: she nervously inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 6]: `` There , and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 9]: All over at once , it felt like .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 9]: The beast attacked me with five arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 3]: She shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 15]: `` I do n't know how you could fight it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: `` How strong , how brave you must be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 4]: This amused him .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 16]: `` The veriest coward will try to save his own life , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 34]: `` If you use such adjectives to me , what words can I find to do justice to you , who dared to come close to such a vile-looking creature and kill it .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 12]: I must thank my stars that you carried the revolver . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 8]: she said , `` that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 8]: You do not practice what you preach .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 12]: I found your pistol lying on the stone in the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 10]: That is one reason why I followed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 5]: It was quite true .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 20]: He laid the weapon aside when delving at the rock , and forgot to replace it in his belt .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 19]: `` It was stupid of me , '' he admitted ; `` but I am not sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 14]: `` Because , as it is , I owe you my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 10]: `` You owe me nothing , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 12]: `` It is very thoughtless of you to run such risks .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 11]: What will become of me if anything happens to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 12]: My point of view is purely selfish , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 4]: `` Quite so .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 4]: Purely selfish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 4]: He smiled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 14]: `` Selfish people of your type are somewhat rare , Miss Deane . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 30]: Not a conversation worth noting , perhaps , save in so far as it is typical of the trite utterances of people striving to recover from some tremendous ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 15]: Epigrams delivered at the foot of the scaffold have always been carefully prepared beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 13]: The bandage was ready ; one end was well soaked in brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 15]: She moved towards the cave , but he cried -- `` Wait one minute .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 10]: I want to get a couple of crowbars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 8]: `` I must go back there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 11]: He jerked his head in the direction of the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 8]: She uttered a little sob of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 13]: `` I will incur no danger this time , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 6]: `` I found rifles there .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 11]: We must have them ; they may mean salvation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 11]: When Iris was determined about anything , her chin dimpled .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 5]: It puckered delightfully now .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 11]: `` I will come with you , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 6]: I will wait for you .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 9]: The tide will serve for another hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 7]: He knew he had decided rightly .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 10]: She could not bear to be alone -- yet .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 12]: Soon the bandage was adjusted and they returned to the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 34]: Scrambling now with difficulty over the rough and dangerous track , Iris was secretly amazed by the remembrance of the daring activity she displayed during her earlier passage along the same precarious roadway .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 15]: Then she darted from rock to rock with the fearless certainty of a chamois .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 19]: Her only stumble was caused , she recollected , by an absurd effort to avoid wetting her dress .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 9]: She laughed nervously when they reached the place .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 10]: This time Jenks lifted her across the intervening channel .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 10]: `` Is this the spot where you fell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 5]: he asked , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 10]: `` Yes ; how did you guess it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 9]: `` I read it in your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 17]: `` Then please do not read my eyes , but look where you are going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 12]: `` Perhaps I was doing that too , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 18]: They were standing on the landward side of the shallow water in which he fought the octopus .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 25]: Already the dark fluid emitted by his assailant in its final discomfiture was passing away , owing to the slight movement of the tide .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 12]: Iris was vaguely conscious of a double meaning in his words .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 8]: She did not trouble to analyze them .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 18]: All she knew was that the man 's voice conveyed a subtle acknowledgment of her feminine divinity .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 11]: The resultant thrill of happiness startled , even dismayed her .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 11]: This incipient flirtation must be put a stop to instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 21]: `` Now that you have brought me here with so much difficulty , what are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 15]: `` It will be madness for you to attempt to ford that passage again .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 16]: Where there is one of those horrible things there are others , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: Jenks smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 17]: Somehow he knew that this strict adherence to business was a cloak for her real thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 11]: Already these two were able to dispense with spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 7]: But he sedulously adopted her pretext .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 15]: `` That is one reason why I brought the crowbars , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 18]: `` If you will sit down for a little while I will have everything properly fixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 17]: He delved with one of the bars until it lodged in a crevice of the coral .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 21]: Then a few powerful blows with the back of the axe wedged it firmly enough to bear any ordinary strain .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 26]: The rope-ends reeved through the pulley on the tree were lying where they fell from the girl 's hand at the close of the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 40]: He deftly knotted them to the rigid bar , and a few rapid turns of a piece of wreckage passed between the two lines strung them into a tautness that could not be attained by any amount of pulling .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 7]: Iris watched the operation in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 12]: The sailor always looked at his best when hard at work .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 19]: The half-sullen , wholly self-contained expression left his face , which lit up with enthusiasm and concentrated intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 11]: That which he essayed he did with all his might .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 8]: Will power and physical force worked harmoniously .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 9]: She had never before seen such a man .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 10]: At such moments her admiration of him was unbounded .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 26]: He , toiling with steady persistence , felt not the inward spur which sought relief in speech , but Iris was compelled to say something .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 32]: `` I suppose , '' she commented with an air of much wisdom , `` you are contriving an overhead railway for the safe transit of yourself and the goods ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 6]: `` Y -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 10]: `` Why are you so doubtful about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 9]: `` Because I personally intended to walk across .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 10]: The ropes will serve to convey the packages . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 4]: She rose imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 11]: `` I absolutely forbid you to enter the water again .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 10]: Such a suggestion on your part is quite shameful .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 34]: You are taking a grave risk for no very great gain that I can see , and if anything happens to you I shall be left all alone in this awful place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 8]: She could think of no better argument .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 17]: Her only resource was a woman 's expedient -- a plea for protection against threatening ills .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 11]: The sailor seemed to be puzzled how best to act .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 19]: `` Miss Deane , '' he said , `` there is no such serious danger as you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 8]: Last time the cuttle caught me napping .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 7]: He will not do so again .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 6]: Those rifles I must have .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 17]: If it will serve to reassure you , I will go along the line myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: He made this concession grudgingly .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 60]: In very truth , if danger still lurked in the neighboring sea , he would be far less able to avoid it whilst clinging to a rope that sagged with his weight , and thus working a slow progress across the channel , than if he were on his feet and prepared to make a rush backwards or forwards .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 21]: Not until Iris watched him swinging along with vigorous overhead clutches did this phase of the undertaking occur to her .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 13]: He let go and dropped into the water , turning towards her .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 8]: `` What is the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 7]: `` Go on ; do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 13]: He stood meekly on the further side to listen to her rating .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 25]: `` You knew all the time that it would be better to walk , yet to please me you adopted an absurdly difficult method .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 7]: Why did you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: `` You have answered your own question . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 13]: `` Well , I am very , very angry with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 24]: `` I 'll tell you what , '' he said , `` if you will forgive me I will try and jump back .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 34]: I once did nineteen feet three inches in -- er -- in a meadow , but it makes such a difference when you look at a stretch of water the same width . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 11]: `` I wish you would not stand there talking nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 16]: The tide will be over the reef in half an hour , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 7]: Without another word he commenced operations .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 15]: There was plenty of rope , and the plan he adopted was simplicity itself .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 25]: When each package was securely fastened he attached it to a loop that passed over the line stretched from the tree to the crowbar .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 19]: To this loop he tied the lightest rope he could find and threw the other end to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 37]: By pulling slightly she was able to land at her feet even the cumbrous rifle-chest , for the traveling angle was so acute that the heavier the article the more readily it sought the lower level .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 15]: They toiled in silence until Jenks could lay hands on nothing more of value .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: Then , observing due care , he quickly passed the channel .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 19]: For an instant the girl gazed affrightedly at the sea until the sailor stood at her side again .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 18]: `` You see , '' he said , `` you have scared every cuttle within miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 27]: And he thought that he would give many years of his life to be able to take her in his arms and kiss away her anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 17]: But the tide had turned ; in a few minutes the reef would be partly submerged .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 49]: To carry the case of rifles to the mainland was a manifestly impossible feat , so Jenks now did that which , done earlier , would have saved him some labor -- he broke open the chest , and found that the weapons were apparently in excellent order .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 17]: He snapped the locks and squinted down the barrels of half a dozen to test them .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 7]: These he laid on one side .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 47]: Then he rapidly constructed a small raft from loose timbers , binding them roughly with rope , and to this argosy he fastened the box of tea , the barrels of flour , the broken saloon-chair , and other small articles which might be of use .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 18]: He avoided any difficulty in launching the raft by building it close to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 31]: When all was ready the rising tide floated it for him ; he secured it to his longest rope , and gave it a vigorous push off into the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 28]: Then he slung four rifles across his shoulders , asked Iris to carry the remaining two in like manner , and began to manoeuvre the raft landwards .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 16]: `` Whilst you land the goods I will prepare dinner , '' announced the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 16]: `` Please be careful not to slip again on the rocks , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 5]: `` Indeed I will .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 11]: My ankle gives me a reminder at each step . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 9]: `` I was more concerned about the rifles .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 27]: If you fell you might damage them , and the incoming tide will so hopelessly rust those I leave behind that they will be useless . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 9]: This assumption at brutality no longer deceived her .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 22]: `` I will preserve them at any cost , though with six in our possession there is a margin for accidents .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 12]: However , to reassure you , I will go back quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 20]: If I fall a second time you will still be able to replace any deficiencies in our armament . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 29]: Before he could protest she started off at a run , jumping lightly from rock to rock , though the effort cost her a good deal of pain .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 14]: Disregarding his shouts , she persevered until she stood safely on the sands .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 13]: Then saucily waving a farewell , she set off towards the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 34]: Had she seen the look of fierce despair that settled down upon Jenks 's face as he turned to his task of guiding the raft ashore she might have wondered what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 10]: In any case she would certainly have behaved differently .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 17]: By the time the sailor had safely landed his cargo Iris had cooked their midday meal .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: She achieved a fresh culinary triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: The eggs were fried !
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 17]: `` I am seriously thinking of trying to boil a ham , '' she stated gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 15]: `` Have you any idea how long it takes to cook one properly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 11]: `` A quarter of an hour for each pound . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 3]: `` Admirable !
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 10]: But we can measure neither hours nor pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 8]: `` I think we can do both .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 9]: I will construct a balance of some kind .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 33]: Then , with a ham slung to one end , and a rifle and some cartridges to the other , I will tell you the weight of the ham to an ounce .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 14]: To ascertain the time , I have already determined to fashion a sun-dial .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 22]: I remember the requisite divisions with reasonable accuracy , and a little observation will enable us to correct any mistakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 18]: `` You are really very clever , Mr. Jenks , '' said Iris , with childlike candor .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 19]: `` Have you spent several years of your life in preparing for residence on a desert island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 6]: `` Something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 14]: I have led a queer kind of existence , full of useless purposes .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 18]: Fate has driven me into a corner where my odds and ends of knowledge are actually valuable .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 7]: Such accidents make men millionaires . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 5]: `` Useless purposes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 7]: `` I can hardly credit that .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 15]: One uses such a phrase to describe fussy people , alive with foolish activity .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 13]: Your worst enemy would not place you in such a category . ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 16]: `` My worst enemy made the phrase effective at any rate , Miss Deane . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 10]: `` You mean that he ruined your career ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 7]: `` Well -- er -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 11]: I suppose that describes the position with fair accuracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 9]: `` Was he a very great scoundrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 8]: `` He was , and is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 6]: Jenks spoke with quiet bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 12]: The girl 's words had evoked a sudden flood of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 41]: For the moment he did not notice how he had been trapped into speaking of himself , nor did he see the quiet content on Iris 's face when she elicited the information that his chief foe was a man .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 37]: A certain tremulous hesitancy in her manner when she next spoke might have warned him , but his hungry soul caught only the warm sympathy of her words , which fell like rain on parched soil .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 9]: `` You are tired , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 16]: `` Wo n't you smoke for a little while , and talk to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 15]: He produced his pipe and tobacco , but he used his right hand awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 22]: It was evident to her alert eyes that the torn quick on his injured finger was hurting him a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 32]: The exciting events of the morning had caused him temporarily to forget his wound , and the rapid coursing of the blood through the veins was now causing him agonized throbs .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 17]: With a cry of distress she sprang to her feet and insisted upon washing the wound .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 51]: Then she tenderly dressed it with a strip of linen well soaked in brandy , thinking the while , with a sudden rush of color to her face , that although he could suggest this remedy for her slight hurt , he gave no thought to his own serious injury .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 9]: Finally she pounced upon his pipe and tobacco-box .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 10]: `` Do n't be alarmed , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 12]: `` I have often filled my father 's pipe for him .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 21]: First , you put the tobacco in loosely , taking care not to use any that is too finely powdered .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 8]: Then you pack the remainder quite tightly .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 6]: But I was nearly forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 16]: I have n't blown , through the pipe to see if it is clean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 16]: She suited the action to the word , using much needless breath in the operation .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 11]: `` That is a first-rate pipe , '' she declared .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 23]: `` My father always said that a straight stem , with the bowl at a right angle , was the correct shape .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 7]: You evidently agree with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 4]: `` Absolutely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 11]: `` You will like my father when you meet him .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 13]: He is the very best man alive , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 10]: `` You two are great friends , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 4]: `` Great friends !
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 12]: He is the only friend I possess in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 6]: Is that quite accurate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 5]: `` Oh , quite .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 17]: Of course , Mr. Jenks , I can never forget how much I owe to you .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 19]: I like you immensely , too , although you are so -- so gruff to me at times .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 16]: But -- but -- you see , my father and I have always been together .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 12]: I have neither brother nor sister , not even a cousin .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 16]: My dear mother died from some horrid fever when I was quite a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 8]: My father is everything to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: `` Dear child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 14]: he murmured , apparently uttering his thoughts aloud rather than addressing her directly .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: `` So you find me gruff , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 10]: `` A regular bear , when you lecture me .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 6]: But that is only occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 16]: You can be very nice when you like , when you forget your past troubles .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 11]: And pray , why do you call me a child ?
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 7]: `` Have I done so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: `` Not a moment ago .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 8]: How old are you , Mr. Jenks ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 9]: I am twenty -- twenty last December . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 16]: `` And I , '' he said , `` will be twenty-eight in August . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 17]: `` I am very sorry , but I really thought you were forty at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 8]: `` I look it , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 18]: Let me be equally candid and admit that you , too , show your age markedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 4]: She smiled nervously .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 33]: `` What a lot of trouble you must have had to -- to -- to give you those little wrinkles in the corners of your mouth and eyes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 3]: `` Wrinkles !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 4]: How terrible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 21]: I think they rather suit you ; besides , it was stupid of me to imagine you were so old .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 21]: I suppose exposure to the sun creates wrinkles , and you must have lived much in the open air . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 20]: `` Early rising and late going to bed are bad for the complexion , '' he declared , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 15]: `` I often wonder how army officers manage to exist , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 17]: `` They never seem to get enough sleep , in the East , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 25]: I have seen them dancing for hours after midnight , and heard of them pig-sticking or schooling hunters at five o'clock next morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 12]: `` So you assume I have been in the army ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 9]: `` I am quite sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 7]: `` May I ask why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 24]: `` Your manner , your voice , your quiet air of authority , the very way you walk , all betray you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 18]: `` Then , '' he said sadly , `` I will not attempt to deny the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: I held a commission in the Indian Staff Corps for nine years .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 51]: It was a hobby of mine , Miss Deane , to make myself acquainted with the best means of victualing my men and keeping them in good health under all sorts of fanciful conditions and in every kind of climate , especially under circumstances when ordinary stores were not available .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 40]: With that object in view I read up every possible country in which my regiment might be engaged , learnt the local names of common articles of food , and ascertained particularly what provision nature made to sustain life .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 5]: The study interested me .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 18]: Once , during the Soudan campaign , it was really useful , and procured me promotion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 7]: `` Tell me about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 41]: `` During some operations in the desert it was necessary for my troop to follow up a small party of rebels mounted on camels , which , as you probably know , can go without water much longer than horses .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 37]: We were almost within striking distance , when our horses completely gave out , but I luckily noticed indications which showed that there was water beneath a portion of the plain much below the general level .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 12]: Half an hour 's spade work proved that I was right .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 21]: We took up the pursuit again , and ran the quarry to earth , and I got my captaincy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 7]: `` Was there no fight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 8]: He paused an appreciable time before replying .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 13]: Then he evidently made up his mind to perform some disagreeable task .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 21]: The watching girl could see the change in his face , the sharp transition from eager interest to angry resentment .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' he went on at last , `` there was a fight .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 31]: It was a rather stiff affair , because a troop of British cavalry which should have supported me had turned back , owing to the want of water already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 19]: But that did not save the officer in charge of the 24th Lancers from being severely reprimanded . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: `` The 24th Lancers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 3]: cried Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 7]: `` Lord Ventnor 's regiment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 10]: `` Lord Ventnor was the officer in question . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 4]: Her face crimonsed .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 7]: `` Then you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 7]: `` Is he your enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 32]: `` And that is why you were so agitated that last day on the _ Sirdar _ , when poor Lady Tozer asked me if I were engaged to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 7]: `` How could it affect you ?
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: You did not even know my name then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 3]: Poor Iris !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 29]: She did not stop to ask herself why she framed her question in such manner , but the sailor was now too profoundly moved to heed the slip .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 63]: She could not tell how he was fighting with himself , fiercely beating down the inner barriers of self-love , sternly determined , once and for all , to reveal himself in such light to this beautiful and bewitching woman that in future she would learn to regard him only as an outcast whose company she must perforce tolerate until relief came .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 16]: `` It affected me because the sudden mention of his name recalled my own disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 16]: I quitted the army six months ago , Miss Deane , under very painful circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 15]: A general court-martial found me guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 10]: I was not even given a chance to resign .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 5]: I was cashiered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 8]: He pretended to speak with cool truculence .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 9]: He thought to compel her into shrinking contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 29]: Yet his face blanched somewhat , and though he steadily kept the pipe between his teeth , and smoked with studied unconcern , his lips twitched a little .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 30]: And he dared not look at her , for the girl 's wondering eyes were fixed upon him , and the blush had disappeared as quickly as it came .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 18]: `` I remember something of this , '' she said slowly , never once averting her gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 15]: `` There was some gossip concerning it when I first came to Hong Kong .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 7]: You are Captain Robert Anstruther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 5]: `` I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 18]: `` And you publicly thrashed Lord Ventnor as the result of a quarrel about a woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 8]: `` Your recollection is quite accurate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: `` Who was to blame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 9]: `` The lady said that I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 6]: `` Was it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 14]: Robert Anstruther , late captain of Bengal Cavalry , rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 8]: He preferred to take his punishment standing .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 21]: `` The court-martial agreed with her , Miss Deane , and I am a prejudiced witness , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 8]: `` Who was the -- lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 11]: `` The wife of my colonel , Mrs. Costobell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 17]: Long afterwards he remembered the agony of that moment , and winced even at the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 20]: But he had decided upon a fixed policy , and he was not a man to flinch from consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 28]: Miss Deane must be taught to despise him , else , God help them both , she might learn to love him as he now loved her .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 36]: So , blundering towards his goal as men always blunder where a woman 's heart is concerned , he blindly persisted in allowing her to make such false deductions as she chose from his words .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 11]: Iris was the first to regain some measure of self-control .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 33]: `` I am glad you have been so candid , Captain Anstruther , '' she commenced , but he broke in abruptly -- `` Jenks , if you please , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 4]: Robert Jenks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 32]: There was a curious light in her eyes , but he did not see it , and her voice was marvelously subdued as she continued -- `` Certainly , Mr. Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 11]: Let me be equally explicit before we quit the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 6]: I have met Mrs. Costobell .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 6]: I do not like her .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 7]: I consider her a deceitful woman .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 16]: Your court-martial might have found a different verdict had its members been of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 11]: As for Lord Ventnor , he is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 40]: It is true he asked my father to be permitted to pay his addresses to me , but my dear old dad left the matter wholly to my decision , and I certainly never gave Lord Ventnor any encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 35]: I believe now that Mrs. Costobell lied , and that Lord Ventnor lied , when they attributed any dishonorable action to you , and I am glad that you beat him in the Club .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: I am quite sure he deserved it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 11]: Not one word did this strange man vouchsafe in reply .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 37]: He started violently , seized the axe lying at his feet , and went straight among the trees , keeping his face turned from Iris so that she might not see the tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 22]: As for the girl , she began to scour her cooking utensils with much energy , and soon commenced a song .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 30]: Considering that she was compelled to constantly endure the company of a degraded officer , who had been expelled from the service with ignominy , she was absurdly contented .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 43]: Indeed , with the happy inconsequence of youth , she quickly threw all care to the winds , and devoted her thoughts to planning a surprise for the next day by preparing some tea , provided she could surreptitiously open the chest .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 33]: CHAPTER VII SURPRISES Before night closed their third day on the island Jenks managed to construct a roomy tent-house , with a framework of sturdy trees selected on account of their location .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 23]: To these he nailed or tied crossbeams of felled saplings ; and the tarpaulins dragged from the beach supplied roof and walls .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 39]: It required the united strength of Iris and himself to haul into position the heavy sheet that topped the structure , whilst he was compelled to desist from active building operations in order to fashion a rough ladder .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 17]: Without some such contrivance he could not get the topmost supports adjusted at a sufficient height .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 29]: Although the edifice required at least two more days of hard work before it would be fit for habitation Iris wished to take up her quarters there immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 8]: This the sailor would not hear of .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 25]: `` In the cave , '' he said , `` you are absolutely sheltered from all the winds that blow or rain that falls .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 13]: Our villa , however , is painfully leaky and draughty at present .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 47]: When asleep , the whole body is relaxed , and you are then most open to the attacks of cold or fever , in which case , Miss Deane , I shall be reluctantly obliged to dose you with a concoction of that tree there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 18]: He pointed to a neighboring cinchona , and Iris naturally asked why he selected that particular brand .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 20]: `` Because it is quinine , not made up in nice little tabloids , but _ au naturel _ .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 33]: It will not be a bad plan if we prepare a strong infusion , and take a small quantity every morning on the excellent principle that prevention is better than cure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 4]: The girl laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 21]: she said ; `` that reminds me -- '' But the words died away on her lips in sudden fright .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 56]: They were standing on the level plateau in front of the cave , well removed from the trees , and they could see distinctly on all sides , for the sun was sinking in a cloudless sky and the air was preternaturally clear , being free now from the tremulous haze of the hot hours .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 44]: Across the smooth expanse of sandy ground came the agonized shrieks of a startled bird -- a large bird , it would seem -- winging its way towards them with incredible swiftness , and uttering a succession of loud full-voiced notes of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: Yet the strange thing was that not a bird was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 28]: At that hour the ordinary feathered inhabitants of the island were quietly nestling among the branches preparatory to making a final selection of the night 's resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 9]: None of them would stir unless actually disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: Iris drew near to the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 6]: Involuntarily she caught his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 24]: He stepped a half-pace in front of her to ward off any danger that might be heralded by this new and uncanny phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 26]: Together they strained their eyes in the direction of the approaching sound , but apparently their sight was bewitched ; as nothing whatever was visible .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 8]: `` Oh , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 15]: wailed Iris , who now clung to Jenks in a state of great apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 45]: The clucking noise came nearer , passed them within a yard , and was already some distance away towards the reef when the sailor burst into a hearty laugh , none the less genuine because of the relief it gave to his bewildered senses .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 20]: Reassured , but still white with fear , Iris cried : `` Do speak , please , Mr. Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 5]: `` A beetle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 5]: he managed to gasp .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 5]: `` A beetle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 27]: `` Yes , a small , insignificant-looking fellow , too -- so small that I did not see him until he was almost out of range .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 14]: He has the loudest voice for his size in the whole of creation .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 19]: A man able to shout on the same scale could easily make himself heard for twenty miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 22]: `` Then I do not like such beetles ; I always hated them , but this latest variety is positively detestable .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 16]: Such nasty things ought to be kept in zoological gardens , and not turned loose .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: Moreover , my tea will be boiled into spinach . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 36]: Nevertheless , the tea , though minus sugar or milk , was grateful enough and particularly acceptable to the sailor , who entertained Iris with a disquisition on the many virtues of that marvelous beverage .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 21]: Curiously enough , the lifting of the veil upon the man 's earlier history made these two much better friends .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 28]: With more complete acquaintance there was far less tendency towards certain passages which , under ordinary conditions , could be construed as nothing else than downright flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: They made the pleasing discovery that they could both sing .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 26]: There was hardly an opera in vogue that one or other did not know sufficiently well to be able to recall the chief musical numbers .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 37]: Iris had a sweet and sympathetic mezzo-soprano voice , Jenks an excellent baritone , and , to the secret amazement of the girl , he rendered one or two well-known Anglo-Indian barrack-room ditties with much humor .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 10]: This , then , was the _ mise-en-scéne _ .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 40]: Iris , seated in the broken saloon-chair , which the sailor had firmly wedged into the sand for her accommodation , was attired in a close-fitting costume selected from the small store of garments so wisely preserved by Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 16]: She wore a pair of clumsy men 's boots several sizes too large for her .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 30]: Her hair was tied up in a gipsy knot on the back of her head , and the light of a cheerful log fire danced in her blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 12]: Jenks , unshaven and ragged , squatted tailor wise near her .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 18]: Close at hand , on two sides , the shaggy walls of rock rose in solemn grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 35]: The neighboring trees , decked now in the sable livery of night , were dimly outlined against the deep misty blue of sea and sky or wholly merged in the shadow of the cliffs .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 11]: They lost themselves in the peaceful influences of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 65]: Shipwrecked , remote from human land , environed by dangers known or only conjectured , two solitary beings on a tiny island , thrown haphazard from the depths of the China Sea , this young couple , after passing unscathed through perils unknown even to the writers of melodrama , lifted up their voices in the sheer exuberance of good spirits and abounding vitality .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 24]: The girl was specially attracted by `` The Buffalo Battery , '' a rollicking lyric known to all Anglo-India from Peshawur to Tuticorin .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 47]: The air is the familiar one of the `` Hen Convention , '' and the opening verse runs in this wise : I love to hear the sepoy with his bold and martial tread , And the thud of the galloping cavalry re-echoes through my head .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 21]: But sweeter far than any sound by mortal ever made Is the tramp of the Buffalo Battery a-going to parade .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 10]: _ Chorus _ : For it 's `` Hainya !
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 2]: hainya !
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 2]: hainya !
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 3]: hainya ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 6]: Twist their tails and go .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 5]: With a `` Hâthi !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 2]: hâthi !
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 3]: hâthi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 24]: ele - _ phant _ and buffa_lo _ , `` Chow-chow , chow-chow , chow-chow , chow-chow , '' `` Tèri ma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 4]: `` Chel-lo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 16]: Oh , that 's the way they shout all day , and drive the buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 45]: Iris would not be satisfied until she understood the meaning of the Hindustani phrases , mastered the nasal pronunciation of `` hainya , '' and placed the artificial accent on _ phant _ and _ lo _ in the second line of the chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 34]: Jenks was concluding the last verse when there came , hurtling through the air , the weird cries of the singing beetle , returning , perchance , from successful foray on Palm-tree Rock .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 13]: This second advent of the insect put an end to the concert .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 10]: Within a quarter of an hour they were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 47]: Thenceforth , for ten days , they labored unceasingly , starting work at daybreak and stopping only when the light failed , finding the long hours of sunshine all too short for the manifold tasks demanded of them , yet thankful that the night brought rest .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 12]: The sailor made out a programme to which he rigidly adhered .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 43]: In the first place , he completed the house , which had two compartments , an inner room in which Iris slept , and an outer , which served as a shelter for their meals and provided a bedroom for the man .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 21]: Then he constructed a gigantic sky-sign on Summit Rock , the small cluster of boulders on top of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 32]: His chief difficulty was to hoist into place the tall poles he needed , and for this purpose he had to again visit Palm-tree Rock in order to secure the pulley .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 27]: By exercising much ingenuity in devising shear-legs , he at last succeeded in lifting the masts into their allotted receptacles , where they were firmly secured .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 63]: Finally he was able to swing into air , high above the tops of the neighboring trees , the loftiest of which he felled in order to clear the view on all sides , the name of the ship _ Sirdar _ , fashioned in six-foot letters nailed and spliced together in sections and made from the timbers of that ill-fated vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 17]: Meanwhile he taught Iris how to weave a net out of the strands of unraveled cordage .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 22]: With this , weighted by bullets , he contrived a casting-net and caught a lot of small fish in the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 21]: At first they were unable to decide which varieties were edible , until a happy expedient occurred to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 11]: `` The seabirds can tell us , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 14]: `` Let us spread out our haul on the sands and leave them .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 20]: By observing those specimens seized by the birds and those they reject we should not go far wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 18]: Though her reasoning was not infallible it certainly proved to be a reliable guide in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 31]: Among the fish selected by the feathered connoisseurs they hit upon two species which most resembled whiting and haddock , and these turned out to be very palatable and wholesome .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 40]: Jenks knew a good deal of botany , and enough about birds to differentiate between carnivorous species and those fit for human food , whilst the salt in their most fortunate supply of hams rendered their meals almost epicurean .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 90]: Think of it , ye dwellers in cities , content with stale buns and leathery sandwiches when ye venture into the wilds of a railway refreshment-room , these two castaways , marooned by queer chance on a desert island , could sit down daily to a banquet of vegetable soup , fish , a roast bird , ham boiled or fried , and a sago pudding , the whole washed down by cool spring water , or , should the need arise , a draught of the best champagne !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 31]: From the rusty rifles on the reef Jenks brought away the bayonets and secured all the screws , bolts , and other small odds and ends which might be serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 36]: From the barrels he built a handy grate to facilitate Iris 's cooking operations , and a careful search each morning amidst the ashes of any burnt wreckage accumulated a store of most useful nails .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 27]: The pressing need for a safe yet accessible bathing place led him and the girl to devote one afternoon to a complete survey of the coast-line .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 13]: By this time they had given names to all the chief localities .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 36]: The northerly promontory was naturally christened North Cape ; the western , Europa Point ; the portion of the reef between their habitation and Palm-tree Rock became Filey Brig ; the other section North-west Reef .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 71]: The flat sandy passage across the island , containing the cave , house , and well , was named Prospect Park ; and the extensive stretch of sand on the south-east , with its guard of broken reefs , was at once dubbed Turtle Beach when Jenks discovered that an immense number of green turtles were paying their spring visit to the island to bury their eggs in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 25]: The two began their tour of inspection by passing the scene of the first desperate struggle to escape from the clutch of the typhoon .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 25]: Iris would not be content until the sailor showed her the rock behind which he placed her for shelter whilst he searched for water .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 23]: For a moment the recollection of their unfortunate companions on board ship brought a lump into her throat and dimmed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 16]: `` I remember them in my prayers every night , '' she confided to him .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 20]: `` It seems so unutterably sad that they should be lost , whilst we are alive and happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 15]: The man distracted her attention by pointing out the embers of their first fire .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 17]: It was the only way to choke back the tumultuous feelings that suddenly stormed his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 2]: Happy !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 10]: Yes , he had never before known such happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 6]: How long would it last ?
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 27]: High up on the cliff swung the signal to anxious searchers of the sea that here would be found the survivors of the _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 30]: And then , when rescue came , when Miss Deane became once more the daughter of a wealthy baronet , and he a disgraced and a nameless outcast -- !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 23]: He set his teeth and savagely struck at a full cup of the pitcher-plant which had so providentially relieved their killing thirst .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 10]: `` Oh , why did you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 3]: pouted Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 4]: `` Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 8]: it was a true friend in need .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 24]: I wish I could do something for it to make it the best and leafiest plant of its kind on the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 5]: `` Very well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 10]: he answered ; `` you can gratify your wish .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 22]: A tinful of fresh water from the well , applied daily to its roots , will quickly achieve that end . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 10]: The moroseness of his tone and manner surprised her .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 14]: For once her quick intuition failed to divine the source of his irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 20]: `` You give your advice ungraciously , '' she said , `` but I will adopt it nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 20]: A harmless incident , a kindly and quite feminine resolve , yet big with fate for both of them .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 51]: Jenks 's unwonted ill-humor -- for the passage of days had driven from his face all its harshness , and from his tongue all its assumed bitterness -- created a passing cloud until the physical exertion of scrambling over the rocks to round the North Cape restored their normal relations .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 39]: A strong current raced by this point to the south-east , and tore away the outlying spur of the headland to such an extent that the sailor was almost inclined to choose the easier way through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 38]: Yet he persevered , and it may be confessed that the opportunities thus afforded of grasping the girl 's arm , of placing a steadying hand on her shoulder , were dominant factors in determining his choice .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 36]: At last they reached the south side , and here they at once found themselves in a delightfully secluded and tiny bay , sandy , tree-lined , sheltered on three sides by cliffs and rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 15]: `` Oh , '' cried Iris , excitedly , `` what a lovely spot !
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 7]: a perfect Smugglers ' Cove . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 20]: `` Charming enough to look at , '' was the answering comment , `` but open to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 21]: If you look at the smooth riband of water out there , you will perceive a passage through the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 16]: A great place for sharks , Miss Deane , but no place for bathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 6]: I had forgotten the sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 23]: I suppose they must live , horrid as they are , but I do n't want them to dine on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 16]: The mention of such disagreeable adjuncts to life on the island no longer terrified her .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 33]: Thus do English new-comers to India pass the first three months ' residence in the country in momentary terror of snakes , and the remaining thirty years in complete forgetfulness of them .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 4]: They passed on .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 36]: Whilst traversing the coral-strewn south beach , with its patches of white soft sand baking in the direct rays of the sun , Jenks perceived traces of the turtle which swarmed in the neighboring sea .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 8]: `` Delicious eggs and turtle soup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 31]: he announced when Iris asked him why he was so intently studying certain marks on the sand , caused by the great sea-tortoise during their nocturnal visits to the breeding-ground .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 20]: `` If they are green turtle , '' he continued , `` we are in the lap of luxury .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 9]: They lard the alderman and inspire the poet .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 24]: When a ship comes to our assistance I will persuade the captain to freight the vessel with them and make my fortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 24]: `` I suppose , under the circumstances , you were not a rich man , Mr. Jenks , '' said Iris , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 33]: `` I possess a wealthy bachelor uncle , who made me his heir and allowed me four hundred a year ; so I was a sort of Croesus among Staff Corps officers .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 10]: When the smash came he disowned me by cable .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 24]: By selling my ponies and my other belongings I was able to walk out of my quarters penniless but free from debt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 9]: `` And all through a deceitful woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 14]: Iris peeped at him from under the brim of her sou ` wester .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 30]: He seemed to be absurdly contented , so different was his tone in discussing a necessarily painful topic to the attitude he adopted during the attack on the pitcher-plant .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 10]: She was puzzled , but ventured a further step .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 12]: `` Was she very bad to you , Mr. Jenks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 11]: He stopped and laughed -- actually roared at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 6]: `` Bad to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 9]: `` I had nothing to do with her .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 9]: She was humbugging her husband , not me .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 14]: Fool that I was , I could not mind my own business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 15]: So Mrs. Costobell was not flirting with the man who suffered on her account .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 19]: It is a regrettable but true statement that Iris would willingly have hugged Mrs. Costobell at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 28]: She walked on air during the next half-hour of golden silence , and Jenks did not remind her that they were passing the gruesome Valley of Death .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 21]: Rounding Europa Point , the sailor 's eyes were fixed on their immediate surroundings , but Iris gazed dreamily ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 17]: Hence it was that she was the first to cry in amazement -- `` A boat !
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 4]: See , there !
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 5]: On the rocks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 5]: There was no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 17]: A ship 's boat was perched high and dry on the north side of the cape .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 14]: Even as they scrambled towards it Jenks understood how it had come there .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 42]: When the _ Sirdar _ parted amidships the after section fell back into the depths beyond the reef , and this boat must have broken loose from its davits and been driven ashore here by the force of the western current .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 4]: Was it intact ?
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 4]: Could they escape ?
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 11]: Was this ark stranded on the island for their benefit ?
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 22]: If it were seaworthy , whither should they steer -- to those islands whose blue outlines were visible on the horizon ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 46]: These and a hundred other questions coursed through his brain during the race over the rocks , but all such wild speculations were promptly settled when they reached the craft , for the keel and the whole of the lower timbers were smashed into matchwood .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 7]: But there were stores on board .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 33]: Jenks remembered that Captain Ross 's foresight had secured the provisioning of all the ship 's boats soon after the first wild rush to steady the vessel after the propeller was lost .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 40]: Masts , sails , oars , seats -- all save two water-casks -- had gone ; but Jenks , with eager hands , unfastened the lockers , and here he found a good supply of tinned meats and biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 54]: They had barely recovered from the excitement of this find when the sailor noticed that behind the rocks on which the craft was firmly lodged lay a small natural basin full of salt water , replenished and freshened by the spray of every gale , and completely shut off from all seaward access .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 22]: It was not more than four feet deep , beautifully carpeted with sand , and secluded by rocks on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 11]: Not the tiniest crab or fish was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 6]: It provided an ideal bath .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 4]: Iris was overjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 6]: She pointed towards their habitation .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 18]: `` Mr. Jenks , '' she said , `` I will be with you at tea-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 48]: He gathered all the tins he was able to carry and strode off , enjoining her to fire her revolver if for the slightest reason she wanted assistance , and giving a parting warning that if she delayed too long he would come and shout to her .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 23]: `` I wonder , '' said the girl to herself , watching his retreating figure , `` what he is afraid of .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 14]: Surely by this time we have exhausted the unpleasant surprises of the island .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 8]: Anyhow , now for a splash ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 17]: She was hardly in the water before she began to be afraid on account of Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 13]: Suppose anything happened to him whilst she was thoughtlessly enjoying herself here .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 19]: So strongly did the thought possess her that she hurriedly dressed again and ran off to find him .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 17]: He was engaged in fastening a number of bayonets transversely to a long piece of timber .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: `` What are you doing that for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 8]: `` Why did you return so soon ?
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: Did anything alarm you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 13]: `` I thought you might get into mischief , '' she confessed .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 20]: On the other hand , I am trying to make trouble for any unwelcome visitors , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 35]: `` This is a _ cheval de frise _ , which I intend to set up in front of our cave in case we are compelled to defend ourselves against an attack by savages .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 13]: With this barring the way they can not rush the position . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 3]: She sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 9]: Rainbow Island was a wild spot after all .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 14]: Did not thorns and briers grow very close to the gates of Eden ?
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 29]: On the nineteenth day of their residence on the island the sailor climbed , as was his invariable habit , to the Summit Rock whilst Iris prepared breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 16]: At this early hour the horizon was clearly cut as the rim of a sapphire .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 20]: He examined the whole arc of the sea with his glasses , but not a sail was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 75]: According to his calculations , the growing anxiety as to the fate of the _ Sirdar _ must long ere this have culminated in the dispatch from Hong Kong or Singapore of a special search vessel , whilst British warships in the China Sea would be warned to keep a close lookout for any traces of the steamer , to visit all islands on their route , and to question fishermen whom they encountered .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 14]: So help might come any day , or it might be long deferred .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 25]: He could not pierce the future , and it was useless to vex his soul with questionings as to what might happen next week .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 76]: The great certainty of the hour was Iris -- the blue-eyed , smiling divinity who had come into his life -- waiting for him down there beyond the trees , waiting to welcome him with a sweet-voiced greeting ; and he knew , with a fierce devouring joy , that her cheek would not pale nor her lip tremble when he announced that at least another sun must set before the expected relief reached them .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 45]: He replaced the glasses in their case and dived into the wood , giving a passing thought to the fact that the wind , after blowing steadily from the south for nearly a week , had veered round to the north-east during the night .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: Did the change portend a storm ?
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 32]: Well , they were now prepared for all such eventualities , and he had not forgotten that they possessed , among other treasures , a box of books for rainy days .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: And a rainy day with Iris for company !
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 13]: What gale that ever blew could offer such compensation for enforced idleness ?
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 7]: The morning sped in uneventful work .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 8]: Iris did not neglect her cherished pitcher-plant .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 28]: After luncheon it was her custom now to carry a dishful of water to its apparently arid roots , and she rose to fulfil her self-imposed task .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 10]: `` Let me help you , '' said Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 10]: `` I am not very busy this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 11]: I simply wo n't allow you to touch that shrub .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 10]: The dear thing looks quite glad to see me .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 13]: It drinks up the water as greedily as a thirsty animal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 12]: `` Even a cabbage has a heart , Miss Deane . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 4]: She laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 15]: `` I do believe you are offering me a compliment , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 12]: `` I must indeed have found favor in your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 49]: He had schooled himself to resist the opening given by this class of retort , so he turned to make some corrections in the scale of the sun-dial he had constructed , aided therein by daily observations with the sextant left by the former inhabitant of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 45]: Iris had been gone perhaps five minutes when he heard a distant shriek , twice repeated , and then there came faintly to his ears his own name , not `` Jenks , '' but `` Robert , '' in the girl 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 5]: Something terrible had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 8]: It was a cry of supreme distress .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 14]: Mortal agony or overwhelming terror alone could wring that name from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 35]: Precisely in such moments this man acted with the decision , the unerring judgment , the instantaneous acceptance of great risk to accomplish great results , that marked him out as a born soldier .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 34]: He rushed into the house and snatched from the rifle-rack one of the six Lee-Metfords reposing there in apple-pie order , each with a filled magazine attached and a cartridge already in position .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 41]: Then he ran , with long swift strides , not through the trees , where he could see nothing , but towards the beach , whence , in forty yards , the place where Iris probably was would become visible .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 38]: At once he saw her , struggling in the grasp of two ferocious-looking Dyaks , one , by his garments , a person of consequence , the other a half-naked savage , hideous and repulsive in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 16]: Around them seven men , armed with guns and parangs , were dancing with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 42]: Iris 's captors were endeavoring to tie her arms , but she was a strong and active Englishwoman , with muscles well knit by the constant labor of recent busy days and a frame developed by years of horse-riding and tennis-playing .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 32]: The pair evidently found her a tough handful , and the inferior Dyak , either to stop her screams -- for she was shrieking `` Robert , come to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 21]: with all her might -- or to stifle her into submission , roughly placed his huge hand over her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 7]: These things the sailor noticed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 41]: Some men , brave to rashness , ready as he to give his life to save her , would have raced madly over the intervening ground , scarce a furlong , and attempted a heroic combat of one against nine .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 4]: Not so Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 18]: With the methodical exactness of the parade-ground he settled down on one knee and leveled the rifle .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 10]: At that range the Lee-Metford bullet travels practically point-blank .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 43]: Usually it is deficient in `` stopping '' power , but he had provided against this little drawback by notching all the cartridges in the six rifles after the effective manner devised by an expert named Thomas Atkins during the Tirah campaign .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 7]: None of the Dyaks saw him .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 28]: All were intent on the sensational prize they had secured , a young and beautiful white woman so contentedly roaming about the shores of this Fetish island .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 33]: With the slow speed advised by the Roman philosopher , the backsight and foresight of the Lee-Metford came into line with the breast of the coarse brute clutching the girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 17]: Then something bit him above the heart and simultaneously tore half of his back into fragments .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 18]: He fell , with a queer sob , and the others turned to face this unexpected danger .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 37]: Iris , knowing only that she was free from that hateful grasp , wrenched herself free from the chief 's hold , and ran with all her might along the beach , to Jenks and safety .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 24]: Again , and yet again , the rifle gave its short , sharp snarl , and two more Dyaks collapsed on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 20]: Six were left , their leader being still unconsciously preserved from death by the figure of the flying girl .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 5]: A fourth Dyak dropped .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 13]: The survivors , cruel savages but not cowards , unslung their guns .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 25]: The sailor , white-faced , grim , with an unpleasant gleam in his deep-set eyes and a lower jaw protruding , noticed their preparations .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 6]: `` To the left ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 7]: `` Run towards the trees ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 8]: Iris heard him and strove to obey .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 12]: But her strength was failing her , and she staggered blindly .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 27]: After a few despairing efforts she lurched feebly to her knees , and tumbled face downwards on the broken coral that had tripped her faltering footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 32]: Jenks was watching her , watching the remaining Dyaks , from whom a spluttering volley came , picking out his quarry with the murderous ease of a terrier in a rat-pit .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 30]: Something like a bee in a violent hurry hummed past his ear , and a rock near his right foot was struck a tremendous blow by an unseen agency .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 4]: He liked this .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 10]: It would be a battle , not a battue .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 33]: The fifth Dyak crumpled into the distortion of death , and then their leader took deliberate aim at the kneeling marksman who threatened to wipe him and his band out of existence .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 11]: But his deliberation , though skilful , was too profound .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 29]: The sailor fired first , and was professionally astonished to see the gaudily attired individual tossed violently backward for many yards , finally pitching headlong to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 19]: Had he been charged by a bull in full career he could not have been more utterly discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 7]: The incident was sensational but inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 21]: Yet another member of the band was prostrated ere the two as yet unscathed thought fit to beat a retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 15]: This they now did with celerity , but they dragged their chief with them .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 14]: It was no part of Jenks 's programme to allow them to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 10]: He aimed again at the man nearest the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 9]: There was a sharp click and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 6]: The cartridge was a mis-fire .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 12]: He hastily sought to eject it , and the rifle jammed .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 15]: These little accidents will happen , even in a good weapon like the Lee-Metford .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 11]: Springing to his feet with a yell he ran forward .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 13]: The flying men caught a glimpse of him and accelerated their movements .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 11]: Just as he reached Iris they vanished among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 16]: Slinging the rifle over his shoulder , he picked up the girl in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 7]: She was conscious , but breathless .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 7]: `` You are not hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 19]: he gasped , his eyes blazing into her face with an intensity that she afterwards remembered as appalling .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 7]: `` No , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 10]: `` Listen , '' he continued in labored jerks .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 8]: `` Try and obey me -- exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 9]: I will carry you -- to the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 3]: Stop there .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 11]: Shoot any one you see -- till I come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 5]: She heard him wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 18]: Was he going to leave her , now that he had her safely clasped to his breast ?
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 2]: Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 5]: Ah , she understood .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 9]: Those men must have landed in a boat .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 7]: He intended to attack them again .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 23]: He was going to fight them single-handed , and she would not know what happened to him until it was all over .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 5]: Gradually her vitality returned .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 17]: She almost smiled at the fantastic conceit that _ she _ would desert _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 13]: Jenks placed her on her feet at the entrance to the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 23]: `` You understand , '' he cried , and without waiting for an answer , ran to the house for another rifle .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 18]: This time , to her amazement , he darted back through Prospect Park towards the south beach .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 19]: The sailor knew that the Dyaks had landed at the sandy bay Iris had christened Smugglers ' Cove .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 16]: They were acquainted with the passage through the reef and came from the distant islands .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 11]: Now they would endeavor to escape by the same channel .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: They must be prevented at all costs .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 21]: As they came out into the open he saw three men , not two , pushing off a large sampan .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 13]: One of them , _ mirabile dictu _ , was the chief .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 23]: Then Jenks understood that his bullet had hit the lock of the Dyak 's uplifted weapon , with the result already described .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 7]: By a miracle he had escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 25]: He coolly prepared to slay the three of them with the same calm purpose that distinguished the opening phase of this singularly one-sided conflict .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 19]: The distance was much greater , perhaps 800 yards from the point where the boat came into view .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 5]: He knelt and fired .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 12]: He judged that the missile struck the craft between the trio .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 19]: `` I did n't allow for the sun on the side of the foresight , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: `` Or perhaps I am a bit shaky after the run .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 10]: In any event they ca n't go far . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 12]: A hurrying step on the coral behind him caught his ear .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 12]: Instantly he sprang up and faced about -- to see Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: `` They are escaping , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 15]: `` No fear of that , '' he replied , turning away from her .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 7]: `` Where are the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 4]: `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 13]: `` Do you mean that you killed nearly all those men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 5]: `` Six of them .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 7]: There were nine in all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 8]: He knelt again , lifting the rifle .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 10]: Iris threw herself on her knees by his side .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 17]: There was something awful to her in this chill and business-like declaration of a fixed purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 28]: `` Mr. Jenks , '' she said , clasping her hands in an agony of entreaty , `` do not kill more men for my sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 23]: `` For my own sake , then , '' he growled , annoyed at the interruption , as the sampan was afloat .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 15]: `` Then I ask you for God 's sake not to take another life .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 11]: What you have already done was unavoidable , perhaps right .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 5]: This is murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 9]: He lowered his weapon and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 25]: `` If those men get away they will bring back a host to avenge their comrades -- and secure you , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 15]: `` It may be the will of Providence for such a thing to happen .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 9]: Yet I implore you to spare them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 22]: He placed the rifle on the sand and raised her tenderly , for she had yielded to a paroxysm of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 12]: Not another word did either of them speak in that hour .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 16]: The large triangular sail of the sampan was now bellying out in the south wind .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 22]: A figure stood up in the stern of the boat and shook a menacing arm at the couple on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 17]: It was the Malay chief , cursing them with the rude eloquence of his barbarous tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 9]: And Jenks well knew what he was saying .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 13]: CHAPTER VIII PREPARATIONS They looked long and steadfastly at the retreating boat .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 12]: Soon it diminished to a mere speck on the smooth sea .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 30]: The even breeze kept its canvas taut , and the sailor knew that no ruse was intended -- the Dyaks were flying from the island in fear and rage .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 15]: They would return with a force sufficient to insure the wreaking of their vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 16]: That he would again encounter them at no distant date Jenks had no doubt whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 18]: They would land in such numbers as to render any resistance difficult and a prolonged defence impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 5]: Would help come first ?
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 13]: -- a distracting question to which definite answer could not be given .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 27]: The sailor 's brow frowned in deep lines ; his brain throbbed now with an anxiety singularly at variance with his cool demeanor during the fight .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 36]: He was utterly unconscious that his left arm encircled the shoulder of the girl until she gently disengaged herself and said appealingly -- `` Please , Mr. Jenks , do not be angry with me .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 6]: I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 11]: I could not bear to see you shoot them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 11]: Then he abruptly awoke to the realities of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 4]: `` Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: he said , his drawn features relaxing into a wonderfully pleasing smile .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 8]: `` We will return to our castle .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: We are safe for the remainder of this day , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 10]: Something must be said or done to reassure her .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 19]: She was still grievously disturbed , and he naturally ascribed her agitation to the horror of her capture .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 13]: He dreaded a complete collapse if any further alarms threatened at once .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 26]: Yet he was almost positive -- though search alone would set at rest the last misgiving -- that only one sampan had visited the island .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 15]: Evidently the Dyaks were unprepared as he for the events of the preceding half-hour .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 41]: They were either visiting the island to procure turtle and _ bêche-de-mer _ or had merely called there _ en route _ to some other destination , and the change in the wind had unexpectedly compelled them to put ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 17]: Beyond all doubt they must have been surprised by the warmth of the reception they encountered .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 27]: Probably , when he went to Summit Rock that morning , the savages had lowered their sail and were steadily paddling north against wind and current .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 24]: The most careful scrutiny of the sea would fail to reveal them beyond a distance of six or seven miles at the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 30]: After landing in the hidden bay on the south side , they crossed the island through the trees instead of taking the more natural open way along the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 23]: The fact that he and Iris were then passing the grown-over tract leading to the Valley of Death instantly determined this point .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 20]: The Dyaks knew of this affrighting hollow , and would not approach any nearer to it than was unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 25]: Could he twist this circumstance to advantage if Iris and he were still stranded there when the superstitious sea-rovers next put in an appearance ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 4]: He would see .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 8]: All depended on the girl 's strength .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 36]: If she gave way now -- if , instead of taking instant measures for safety , he were called upon to nurse her through a fever -- the outlook became not only desperate but hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 27]: And , whilst he bent his brows in worrying thought , the color was returning to Iris 's cheeks , and natural buoyancy to her step .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 24]: It is the fault of all men to underrate the marvelous courage and constancy of woman in the face of difficulties and trials .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 8]: Jenks was no exception to the rule .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 29]: `` You do not ask me for any account of my adventures , '' she said quietly , after watching his perplexed expression in silence for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 14]: Her tone almost startled him , its unassumed cheerfulness was so unlooked for .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 7]: `` No , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 15]: `` I thought you were too overwrought to talk of them at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 3]: `` Overwrought !
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 6]: Not a bit of it !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 40]: I was dead beat with the struggle and with screaming for you , but please do n't imagine that I am going to faint or treat you to a display of hysteria now that all the excitement has ended .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 30]: I admit that I cried a little when you pushed me aside on the beach and raised your gun to fire at those poor wretches flying for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 10]: Yet perhaps I was wrong to hinder you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 10]: `` You were wrong , '' he gravely interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 9]: `` Then you should not have heeded me .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 8]: No , I do n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: You always consider me first , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 30]: No matter what I ask you to do you endeavor to please me , even when you know all the time that I am acting or speaking foolishly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: The unthinking _ naïveté _ of her words sent the blood coursing wildly through his veins .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 12]: `` Never mind , '' she went on with earnest simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 9]: `` God has been very good to us .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 30]: I can not believe that He has preserved us from so many dangers to permit us to perish miserably a few hours , or days , before help comes .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 14]: And I _ do _ want to tell you exactly what happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 9]: `` Then you shall , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 7]: `` But first drink this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 17]: They had reached their camping-ground , and he hastened to procure a small quantity of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 11]: She swallowed the spirit with a protesting _ moue _ .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 11]: She really needed no such adventitious support , she said .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: `` All right , '' commented Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 13]: `` If you do n't want a drink , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 12]: `` I can quite believe it , '' she retorted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 8]: _ Your _ case is very different .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 33]: _ I _ knew the men would not hurt me -- after the first shock of their appearance had passed , I mean -- I also knew that you would save me .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 12]: But you , Mr. Jenks , had to do the fighting .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 9]: You were called upon to rescue precious me .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 7]: No wonder you were excited . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 65]: The sailor mentally expressed his inability to grasp the complexities of feminine nature , but Iris rattled on -- `` I carried my tin of water to the pitcher-plant , and was listening to the greedy roots gurgling away for dear life , when suddenly four men sprang out from among the trees and seized my arms before I could reach my revolver . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 7]: `` Thank Heaven you failed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 15]: `` You think that if I had fired at them they would have retaliated .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 10]: Yes , especially if I had hit the chief .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 23]: But it was he who instantly gave some order , and I suppose it meant that they were not to hurt me .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 19]: As a matter of fact , they seemed to be quite as much astonished as I was alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 16]: But if they could hold my hands they could not stop my voice so readily .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: did n't I yell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 5]: `` You did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 11]: `` I suppose you could not hear me distinctly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: `` Quite distinctly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 5]: `` Every word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 15]: She bent to pick some leaves and bits of dry grass from her dress .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 23]: `` Well , you know , '' she continued rapidly , `` in such moments one can not choose one 's words .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: I just shouted the first thing that came into my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 20]: `` And I , '' he said , `` picked up the first rifle I could lay hands on .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 29]: Now , Miss Deane , as the affair has ended so happily , may I venture to ask you to remain in the cave until I return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 9]: `` Oh , please -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 7]: `` Really , I must insist .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 12]: I would not leave you if it were not quite imperative .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 10]: You _ can not _ come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 18]: Then she understood one at least of the tasks he must perform , and she meekly obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 39]: He thought it best to go along Turtle Beach to the cove , and thence follow the Dyaks ' trail through the wood , as this line of advance would entail practically a complete circuit of the island .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 8]: He omitted no precautions in his advance .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: Often he stopped and listened intently .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 34]: Whenever he doubled a point or passed among the trees he crept back and peered along the way he had come , to see if any lurking foes were breaking shelter behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 14]: The marks on the sand proved that only one sampan had been beached .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 26]: Thence he found nothing of special interest until he came upon the chief 's gun , lying close to the trees on the north side .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 10]: It was a very ornamental weapon , a muzzle-loader .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 29]: The stock was inlaid with gold and ivory , and the piece had evidently been looted from some mandarin 's junk surprised and sacked in a former foray .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 47]: The lock was smashed by the impact of the Lee-Metford bullet , but close investigation of the trigger-guard , and the discovery of certain unmistakable evidences on the beach , showed that the Dyak leader had lost two if not three fingers of his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 16]: `` So he has something more than his passion to nurse , '' mused Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 8]: `` That at any rate is fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 16]: He will be in no mood for further enterprise for some time to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 17]: He dreaded lest any of the Dyaks should be only badly wounded and likely to live .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 27]: It was an actual relief to his nerves to find that the improvised Dum-dums had done their work too well to permit anxiety on that score .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 19]: On the principle that a `` dead Injun is a good Injun '' these Dyaks were good Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 20]: He gathered the guns , swords and krisses of the slain , with all their uncouth belts and ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 33]: In pursuance of a vaguely defined plan of future action he also divested some of the men of their coarse garments , and collected six queer-looking hats , shaped like inverted basins .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 11]: These things he placed in a heap near the pitcher-plants .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 24]: Thenceforth , for half an hour , the placid surface of the lagoon was disturbed by the black dorsal fins of many sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 19]: To one of the sailor 's temperament there was nothing revolting in the concluding portion of his task .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 8]: He had a God-given right to live .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 40]: It was his paramount duty , remitted only by death itself , to endeavor to save Iris from the indescribable fate from which no power could rescue her if ever she fell into the hands of these vindictive savages .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 41]: Therefore it was war between him and them , war to the bitter end , war with no humane mitigation of its horrors and penalties , the last dread arbitrament of man forced to adopt the methods of the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 15]: His guess at the weather conditions heralded by the change of wind was right .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 30]: As the two partook of their evening meal the complaining surf lashed the reef , and the tremulous branches of the taller trees voiced the approach of a gale .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 23]: A tropical storm , not a typhoon , but a belated burst of the periodic rains , deluged the island before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 14]: Hours earlier Iris retired , utterly worn by the events of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 11]: Needless to say , there was no singing that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 38]: The gale chanted a wild melody in mournful chords , and the noise of the watery downpour on the tarpaulin roof of Belle Vue Castle was such as to render conversation impossible , save in wearying shouts .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: Luckily , Jenks 's carpentry was effective , though rough .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 25]: The building was water-tight , and he had calked every crevice with unraveled rope until Iris 's apartment was free from the tiniest draught .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 15]: The very fury of the external turmoil acted as a lullaby to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 14]: She was soon asleep , and the sailor was left to his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 5]: Sleep he could not .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: He smoked steadily , with a magnificent prodigality , for his small stock of tobacco was fast diminishing .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 35]: He ransacked his brains to discover some method of escape from this enchanted island , where fairies jostled with demons , and hours of utter happiness found their bane in moments of frightful peril .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 12]: Of course he ought to have killed those fellows who escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 16]: Their sampan might have provided a last desperate expedient if other savages effected a landing .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 33]: Well , there was no use in being wise after the event , and , scheme as he might , he could devise no way to avoid disaster during the next attack .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 12]: This , he felt certain , would take place at night .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 20]: The Dyaks would land in force , rush the cave and hut , and overpower him by sheer numbers .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 15]: The fight , if fight there was , would be sharp , but decisive .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 23]: Perhaps , if he received some warning , Iris and he might retreat in the darkness to the cover of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 13]: A last stand could be made among the boulders on Summit Rock .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 11]: But of what avail to purchase their freedom until daylight ?
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 16]: And then -- If ever man wrestled with desperate problem , Jenks wrought that night .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 30]: He smoked and pondered until the storm passed , and , with the changefulness of a poet 's muse , a full moon flooded the island in glorious radiance .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 38]: He rose , opened the door , and stood without , listening for a little while to the roaring of the surf and the crash of the broken coral swept from reef and shore by the backwash .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: The petty strife of the elements was soothing to him .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 13]: `` They are snarling like whipped dogs , '' he said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 30]: `` One might almost fancy her ladyship the Moon appearing on the scene as a Uranian Venus , cowing sea and storm by the majesty of her presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 16]: Pleased with the conceit , he looked steadily at the brilliant luminary for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 23]: Then his eyes were attracted by the strong lights thrown upon the rugged face of the precipice into which the cavern burrowed .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 35]: Unconsciously relieving his tired senses , he was idly wondering what trick of color Turner would have adopted to convey those sharp yet weirdly beautiful contrasts , when suddenly he uttered a startled exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 8]: `` I never noticed that before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 29]: The feature which so earnestly claimed his attention was a deep ledge , directly over the mouth of the cave , but some forty feet from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 24]: Behind it the wall of rock sloped darkly inwards , suggesting a recess extending by haphazard computation at least a couple of yards .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 41]: It occurred to him that perhaps the fault in the interior of the tunnel had its outcrop here , and the deodorizing influences of rain and sun had extended the weak point thus exposed in the bold panoply of stone .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 10]: He surveyed the ledge from different points of view .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 16]: It was quite inaccessible , and most difficult to estimate accurately from the ground level .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 8]: The sailor was a man of action .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 11]: He chose the nearest tall tree and began to climb .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 25]: He was not eight feet from the ground before several birds flew out from its leafy recesses , filling the air with shrill clucking .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 7]: `` The devil take them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 13]: he growled , for he feared that the commotion would awaken Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 23]: He was still laboriously worming his way through the inner maze of branches when a well-known voice reached him from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 14]: `` Mr. Jenks , what on earth are you doing up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: so those wretched fowls aroused you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 11]: `` Yes ; but why did you arouse them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 19]: `` I had a fancy to roost by way of a change '' `` Please be serious . ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 7]: `` I am more than serious .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 24]: This tree grows a variety of small sharp thorn that induces a maximum of gravity -- before one takes the next step . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 10]: `` But why do you keep on climbing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 9]: `` It is sheer lunacy , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 18]: Yet on such a moonlit night there is some reasonable ground for even a mad excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 14]: `` Mr. Jenks , tell me at once what you are doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 23]: Iris strove to be severe , but there was a touch of anxiety in her tone that instantly made the sailor apologetic .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 38]: He told her about the ledge , and explained his half-formed notion that here they might secure a safe retreat in case of further attack -- a refuge from which they might defy assault during many days .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 14]: It was , he said , absolutely impossible to wait until the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 17]: He must at once satisfy himself whether the project was impracticable or worthy of further investigation .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 17]: So the girl only enjoined him to be careful , and he vigorously renewed the climb .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 27]: At last , some twenty-five feet from the ground , an accidental parting in the branches enabled him to get a good look at the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 8]: One glance set his heart beating joyously .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 43]: It was at least fifteen feet in length ; it shelved back until its depth was lost in the blackness of the shadows , and the floor must be either nearly level or sloping slightly inwards to the line of the fault .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 9]: The place was a perfect eagle 's nest .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 25]: A chamois could not reach it from any direction ; it became accessible to man only by means of a ladder or a balloon .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 24]: More excited by this discovery than he cared for Iris to know , he endeavored to appear unconcerned when he regained the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 15]: `` Well , '' she said , `` tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 26]: He described the nature of the cavity as well as he understood it at the moment , and emphasized his previous explanation of its virtues .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 14]: Here they might reasonably hope to make a successful stand against the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 14]: `` Then you feel sure that those awful creatures will come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 4]: she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 8]: `` Only too sure , unfortunately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 13]: `` How remorseless poor humanity is when the veneer is stripped off !
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 9]: Why can not they leave us in peace ?
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 11]: I suppose they now cherish a blood feud against us .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 16]: Perhaps , if I had not been here , they would not have injured you .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 12]: Somehow I seem to be bound up with your misfortunes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 17]: `` I would not have it otherwise were it in my power , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 27]: For an instant he left unchallenged the girl 's assumption that she was in any way responsible for the disasters which had broken up his career .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 10]: He looked into her eyes and almost forgot himself .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 23]: Then the sense of fair dealing that dominates every true gentleman rose within him and gripped his wavering emotions with ruthless force .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 56]: Was this a time to play upon the high-strung sensibilities of this youthful daughter of the gods , to seek to win from her a confession of love that a few brief days or weeks might prove to be only a spasmodic , but momentarily all-powerful , gratitude for the protection he had given her ?
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 47]: And he spoke aloud , striving to laugh , lest his words should falter -- `` You can console yourself with the thought , Miss Deane , that your presence on the island will in no way affect my fate at the hands of the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 27]: Had they caught me unprepared today my head would now be covered with a solution of the special varnish they carry on every foreign expedition . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 4]: `` Varnish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: `` Yes , as a preservative , you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: `` And yet these men are human beings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 8]: `` For purposes of classification , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 29]: Keeping to strict fact , it was lucky for me that you raised the alarm , and gave me a chance to discount the odds of mere numbers .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 14]: So , you see , you really did me a good turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 11]: `` What can be done now to save our lives ?
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 11]: Anything will be better than to await another attack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 16]: `` The first thing to do is to try to get some sleep before daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 12]: How did you know I was not in the Castle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 7]: `` I can not tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 10]: I awoke and knew you were not near me .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 20]: If I wake in the night I can always tell whether or not you are in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 8]: So I dressed and came out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 5]: he said , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 6]: `` Evidently I snore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 5]: This explanation killed romance .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 18]: Iris retreated and the sailor , tired out at last , managed to close his weary eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 28]: Next morning he hastily constructed a pole of sufficient length and strong enough to bear his weight , by tying two sturdy young trees together with ropes .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 22]: Iris helped him to raise it against the face of the precipice , and he at once climbed to the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 12]: Here he found his observations of the previous night abundantly verified .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 32]: The ledge was even wider than he dared to hope , nearly ten feet deep in one part , and it sloped sharply downwards from the outer lip of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 52]: By lying flat and carefully testing all points of view , he ascertained that the only possible positions from which even a glimpse of the interior floor could be obtained were the branches of a few tall trees and the extreme right of the opposing precipice , nearly ninety yards distant .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 45]: There was ample room to store water and provisions , and he quickly saw that even some sort of shelter from the fierce rays of the sun and the often piercing cold of the night might be achieved by judiciously rigging up a tarpaulin .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 14]: `` This is a genuine bit of good luck , '' he mused .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 24]: `` Here , provided neither of us is hit , we can hold out for a week or longer , at a pinch .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 33]: How can it be possible that I should have lived on this island so many days and yet hit upon this nook of safety by mere chance , as it were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 13]: Not until he reached the level again could he solve the puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 48]: Then he perceived that the way in which the cliff bulged out on both sides prevented the ledge from becoming evident in profile , whilst , seen _ en plein face _ in the glare of the sunlight , it suggested nothing more than a slight indentation .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 15]: He rapidly sketched to Iris the defensive plan which the Eagle 's Nest suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 32]: Access must be provided by means of a rope-ladder , securely fastened inside the ledge , and capable of being pulled up or let down at the will of the occupants .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 20]: Then the place must be kept constantly stocked with a judicious supply of provisions , water , and ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 16]: They could be covered with a tarpaulin , and thus kept in fairly good condition .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 39]: `` We ought to sleep there every night , '' he went on , and his mind was so engrossed with the tactical side of the preparations that he did not notice how Iris blanched at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 9]: `` Surely not until danger actually threatens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 9]: `` Danger threatens us each hour after sunset .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 16]: It may come any night , though I expect at least a fortnight 's reprieve .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 19]: Nevertheless , I intend to act as if tonight may witness the first shot of the siege . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 7]: `` Do you mean that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 3]: she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 12]: `` And my little room is becoming so very cozy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 15]: Belle Vue Castle , their two-roomed hut , was already a home to them .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 7]: Jenks always accepted her words literally .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 28]: `` Well , '' he announced , after a pause , `` it may not be necessary to take up our quarters there until the eleventh hour .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 26]: After I have hoisted up our stores and made the ladder , I will endeavor to devise an efficient cordon of sentinels around our position .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 5]: We will see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 13]: Not another word could Iris get out of him on the topic .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 10]: Indeed , he provided her with plenty of work .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 30]: By this time she could splice a rope more neatly than her tutor , and her particular business was to prepare no less than sixty rungs for the rope-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 17]: This was an impossible task for one day , but after dinner the sailor helped her .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 18]: They toiled late , until their fingers were sore and their backbones creaked as they sat upright .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 23]: Meanwhile Jenks swarmed up the pole again , and drew up after him a crowbar , the sledge-hammer , and the pickaxe .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 12]: With these implements he set to work to improve the accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 36]: Of course he did not attempt seriously to remove any large quantity of rock , but there were projecting lumps here and inequalities of floor there which could be thumped or pounded out of existence .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 14]: It was surprising to see what a clearance he made in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 26]: The existence of the fault helped him a good deal , as the percolation of water at this point had oxidized the stone to rottenness .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 24]: To his great joy he discovered that a few prods with the pick laid bare a small cavity which could be easily enlarged .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 46]: Here he contrived a niche where Iris could remain in absolute safety when barricaded by stores , whilst , with a squeeze , she was entirely sheltered from the one dangerous point on the opposite cliff , nor need she be seen from the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 66]: Having hauled into position two boxes of ammunition -- for which he had scooped out a special receptacle -- the invaluable water-kegs from the stranded boat , several tins of biscuits and all the tinned meats , together with three bottles of wine and two of brandy , he hastily abandoned the ledge and busied himself with fitting a number of gun-locks to heavy faggots .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 10]: Iris watched his proceedings in silence for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 13]: At last the interval for luncheon enabled her to demand an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 39]: `` If you do n't tell me at once what you intend to do with those strange implements , '' she said , `` I will form myself into an amalgamated engineer and come out on strike . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 16]: `` If you do , '' he answered , `` you will create a precedent .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 21]: There is no recorded case of a laborer claiming what he calls his rights when his life is at stake .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 17]: Even an American tramp has been known to work like a fiend under that condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 18]: `` Simply because an American tramp tries , like every other mere male , to be logical .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 6]: A woman is more heroic .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 40]: I once read of a French lady being killed during an earthquake because she insisted on going into a falling house to rescue that portion of her hair which usually rested on the dressing-table whilst she was asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 22]: `` I happen to know , '' he said , `` that you are personally unqualified to emulate her example . ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 14]: She laughed merrily , so lightly did yesterday 's adventure sit upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 20]: The allusion to her disheveled state when they were thrown ashore by the typhoon simply impressed her as amusing .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 15]: Thus quickly had she become inured to the strange circumstances of a new life .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 18]: `` I withdraw the threat and substitute a more genuine plea -- curiosity , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 8]: `` Then you will be gratified promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 5]: These are our sentinels .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 14]: Come with me to allot his post to the most distant one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 32]: He picked up a faggot with its queer attachment , shouldered a Lee-Metford , and smiled when he saw the business-like air with which Iris slung a revolver around her waist .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 20]: They walked rapidly to Smugglers ' Cove , and the girl soon perceived the ingenuity of his automatic signal .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 18]: He securely bound the block of wood to a tree where it was hidden by the undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 31]: Breaking the bullet out of a cartridge , he placed the blank charge in position in front of the striker , the case being firmly clasped by a bent nail .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 51]: To the trigger , the spring of which he had eased to a slight pressure , he attached a piece of unraveled rope , and this he carefully trained among the trees at a height of six inches from the ground , using as carriers nails driven into the trunks .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 20]: The ultimate result was that a mere swish of Iris 's dress against the taut cord exploded the cartridge .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 5]: he exclaimed , exultantly .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 35]: `` When I have driven stakes into the sand to the water 's edge on both sides of the cove , I will defy them to land by night without giving us warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 26]: `` Do you know , '' said Iris , in all seriousness , `` I think you are the cleverest man in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 16]: `` My dear Miss Deane , that is not at all a Trades Unionist sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 9]: Equality is the key-note of their propaganda . ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 19]: Nevertheless he was manifestly pleased by the success of his ingenious contrivance , and forthwith completed the cordon .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 14]: To make doubly sure , he set another snare further within the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 17]: He was certain the Dyaks would not pass along Turtle Beach if they could help it .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 8]: By this time the light was failing .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 14]: `` That will suffice for the present , '' he told the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 13]: `` Tomorrow we will place other sentries in position at strategic points .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 12]: Then we can sleep in the Castle with tolerable safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 24]: By the meager light of the tiny lamp they labored sedulously at the rope-ladder until Iris 's eyes were closing with sheer weariness .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 18]: Neither of them had slept much during the preceding night , and they were both completely tired .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 40]: It was with a very weak little smile that the girl bade him `` good night , '' and they were soon wrapped in that sound slumber which comes only from health , hard work , and wholesome fare .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 28]: The first streaks of dawn were tipping the opposite crags with roseate tints when the sailor was suddenly aroused by what he believed to be a gunshot .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 6]: He could not be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 21]: He was still collecting his scattered senses , straining eyes and ears intensely , when there came a second report .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 7]: Then he knew what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 14]: The sentries on the Smugglers ' Cove post were faithful to their trust .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 6]: The enemy was upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: At such a moment Jenks was not a man who prayed .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 28]: Indeed , he was prone to invoke the nether powers , a habit long since acquired by the British army , in Flanders , it is believed .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 9]: There was not a moment to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 24]: He rushed into Iris 's room , and gathered in his arms both her and the weird medley of garments that covered her .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 50]: He explained to the protesting girl , as he ran with her to the foot of the rock , that she must cling to his shoulders with unfaltering courage whilst he climbed to the ledge with the aid of the pole and the rope placed there the previous day .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 11]: It was a magnificent feat of strength that he essayed .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 25]: In calmer moments he would have shrunk from its performance , if only on the score of danger to the precious burden he carried .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 8]: Now there was no time for thought .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 36]: Up he went , hand over hand , clinging to the rough pole with the tenacity of a limpet , and taking a turn of the rope over his right wrist at each upward clutch .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 41]: At last , breathless but triumphant , he reached the ledge , and was able to gasp his instructions to Iris to crawl over his bent back and head until she was safely lodged on the broad platform of rock .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 16]: Then , before she could expostulate , he descended , this time for the rifles .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 24]: These he hastily slung to the rope , again swarmed up the pole , and drew the guns after him with infinite care .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 19]: Even in the whirl of the moment he noticed that Iris had managed to partially complete her costume .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 33]: `` Now we are ready for them , '' he growled , lying prone on the ledge and eagerly scanning both sides of Prospect Park for a first glimpse of their assailants .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 25]: For two shivering hours they waited there , until the sun was high over the cliff and filled sea and land with his brightness .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 20]: At last , despite the girl 's tears and prayers , Jenks insisted on making a reconnaissance in person .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 13]: Let this portion of their adventures be passed over with merciful brevity .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 13]: Both watch-guns had been fired by the troupe of tiny wou-wou monkeys !
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 47]: Iris did not know whether to laugh or cry , when Jenks , with much difficulty , lowered her to mother earth again , and marveled the while how he had managed to carry forty feet into the air a young woman who weighed so solidly .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 28]: They sat down to a belated breakfast , and Jenks then became conscious that the muscles of his arms , legs , and back were aching hugely .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 15]: It was by that means he could judge the true extent of his achievement .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 41]: Iris , too , realized it gradually , but , like the Frenchwoman in the earthquake , she was too concerned with memories of her state of deshabille to appreciate , all at once , the incidents of the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 20]: CHAPTER IX THE SECRET OF THE CAVE The sailor went after those monkeys in a mood of relentless severity .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 39]: Thus far , the regular denizens of Rainbow Island had dwelt together in peace and mutual goodwill , but each diminutive wou-wou must be taught not to pull any strings he found tied promiscuously to trees or stakes .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 14]: As a preliminary essay , Jenks resolved to try force combined with artifice .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 33]: Failing complete success , he would endeavor to kill every monkey in the place , though he had in full measure the inherent dislike of Anglo-India to the slaying of the tree-people .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 9]: This , then , is what he did .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 36]: After filling a biscuit tin with good-sized pebbles , he donned a Dyak hat , blouse , and belt , rubbed earth over his face and hands , and proceeded to pelt the wou-wous mercilessly .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 29]: For more than an hour he made their lives miserable , until at the mere sight of him they fled , shrieking and gurgling like a thousand water-bottles .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 16]: Finally he constructed several Dyak scarecrows and erected one to guard each of his alarm-guns .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 6]: The device was thoroughly effective .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 55]: Thenceforth , when some adventurous monkey -- swinging with hands or tail among the treetops in the morning search for appetizing nut or luscious plantain -- saw one of those fearsome bogies , he raised such a hubbub that all his companions scampered hastily from the confines of the wood to the inner fastnesses .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 51]: In contriving these same scarecrows -- which , by the way , he had vaguely intended at first to erect on the beach in order to frighten the invaders and induce them to fire a warning volley -- the sailor paid closer heed to the spoils gathered from the fallen .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 33]: One , at least , of the belts was made of human hair , and some among its long strands could have come only from the flaxen-haired head of a European child .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 25]: This fact , though ghastly enough , confirmed him in his theory that it was impossible to think of temporizing with these human fiends .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 20]: Unhappily such savage virtues as they possess do not include clemency to the weak or hospitality to defenceless strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 25]: There was nothing for it but a fight to a finish , with the law of the jungle to decide the terms of conquest .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 24]: That morning , of course , he had not been able to visit Summit Rock until after his cautious survey of the island .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 24]: Once there , however , he noticed that the gale two nights earlier had loosened two of the supports of his sky sign .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 14]: It was not a difficult or a long job to repair the damage .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 14]: With the invaluable axe he cut several wedges and soon made all secure .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 30]: Now , during each of the two daily examinations of the horizon which he never omitted , he minutely scrutinized the sea between Rainbow Island and the distant group .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 9]: It was , perhaps , a needless precaution .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 7]: The Dyaks would come at night .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 27]: With a favorable wind they need not set sail until dusk , and their fleet sampans would easily cover the intervening forty miles in five hours .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 17]: He could not be positive that they were actual inhabitants of the islands to the south .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 29]: The China Sea swarms with wandering pirates , and the tribe whose animosity he had earned might be equally noxious to some peaceable fishing community on the coast .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 19]: Again and again he debated the advisability of constructing a seaworthy raft and endeavoring to make the passage .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 26]: But this would be risking all on a frightful uncertainty , and the accidental discovery of the Eagle 's Nest had given him new hope .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 20]: Here he could make a determined and prolonged stand , and in the end help _ must _ come .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 22]: So he dismissed the navigation project , and devoted himself wholly to the perfecting of the natural fortress in the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 7]: That night they finished the rope-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 59]: Indeed , Jenks was determined not to retire to rest until it was placed _ in situ _ ; he did not care to try a second time to carry Iris to that elevated perch , and it may be remarked that thenceforth the girl , before going to sleep , simply changed one ragged dress for another .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 26]: One of the first things he contemplated was the destruction , if possible , of the point on the opposite cliff which commanded the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 14]: This , however , was utterly impracticable with the appliances at his command .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 28]: The top of the rock sloped slightly towards the west , and nothing short of dynamite or regular quarrying operations would render it untenable by hostile marksmen .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 23]: During the day his Lee-Metfords , at ninety yards ' range , might be trusted to keep the place clear of intruders .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 9]: But at night -- that was the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 54]: He partially solved it by fixing two rests on the ledge to support a rifle in exact line with the center of the enemy 's supposed position , and as a variant , on the outer rest he marked lines which corresponded with other sections of the entire front available to the foe .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 7]: Even then he was not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 20]: When time permitted he made many experiments with ropes reeved through the pulley and attached to a rifle action .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 17]: He might have succeeded in his main object had not his thoughts taken a new line .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 19]: His aim was to achieve some method of opening and closing the breech-block by means of two ropes .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 50]: The difficulty was to secure the preliminary and final lateral movement of the lever bolt , but it suddenly occurred to him that if he could manage to convey the impression that Iris and he had left the island , the Dyaks would go away after a fruitless search .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 31]: The existence of ropes along the face of the rock -- an essential to his mechanical scheme -- would betray their whereabouts , or at any rate excite dangerous curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 20]: So he reluctantly abandoned his original design , though not wholly , as will be seen in due course .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 42]: In pursuance of his latest idea he sedulously removed from the foot of the cliff all traces of the clearance effected on the ledge , and , although he provided supports for the tarpaulin covering , he did not adjust it .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 18]: Iris and he might lie _ perdu _ there for days without their retreat being found out .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 24]: This development suggested the necessity of hiding their surplus stores and ammunition , and what spot could be more suitable than the cave ?
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 29]: So Jenks began to dig once more in the interior , laboring manfully with pick and shovel in the locality of the fault with its vein of antimony .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 15]: It was thus that he blundered upon the second great event of his life .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 30]: Rainbow Island had given him the one thing a man prizes above all else -- a pure yet passionate love for a woman beautiful alike in body and mind .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 21]: And now it was to endow him with riches that might stir the pulse of even a South African magnate .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 38]: For the sailor , unmindful of purpose other than providing the requisite _ cache _ , shoveling and delving with the energy peculiar to all his actions , suddenly struck a deep vein of almost virgin gold .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 36]: To facilitate the disposal at a distance of the disturbed debris , he threw each shovelful on to a canvas sheet , which he subsequently dragged among the trees in order to dislodge its contents .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 22]: After doing this four times he noticed certain metallic specks in the fifth load which recalled the presence of the antimony .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 22]: But the appearance of the sixth cargo was so remarkable when brought out into the sunlight that it invited closer inspection .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 41]: Though his knowledge of geology was slight -- the half-forgotten gleanings of a brief course at Eton -- he was forced to believe that the specimens he handled so dubiously contained neither copper nor iron pyrites but glittering yellow gold .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 24]: Their weight , the distribution of the metal through quartz in a transition state between an oxide and a telluride , compelled recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 19]: Somewhat excited , yet half skeptical , he returned to the excavation and scooped out yet another collection .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 8]: This time there could be no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 10]: Nature 's own alchemy had fashioned a veritable ingot .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 29]: There were small lumps in the ore which would need alloy at the mint before they could be issued as sovereigns , so free from dross were they .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 16]: Iris had gone to Venus 's Bath , and would be absent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 7]: Jenks sat down on a tree-stump .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 16]: He held in his hand a small bit of ore worth perhaps twenty pounds sterling .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 20]: Slowly the conjectures already pieced together in his mind during early days on the island came back to him .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 45]: The skeleton of an Englishman lying there among the bushes near the well ; the Golgotha of the poison-filled hollow ; the mining tools , both Chinese and European ; the plan on the piece of tin -- ah , the piece of tin !
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 12]: Mechanically the sailor produced it from the breast-pocket of his jersey .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 12]: At last the mysterious sign `` 32/1 '' revealed its significance .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 27]: Measure thirty-two feet from the mouth of the tunnel , dig one foot in depth , and you came upon the mother-lode of this gold-bearing rock .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 11]: This , then , was the secret of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 23]: The Chinese knew the richness of the deposit , and exploited its treasures by quarrying from the other side of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 12]: But their crass ignorance of modern science led to their undoing .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 15]: The accumulation of liberated carbonic acid gas in the workings killed them in scores .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 25]: They probably fought this unseen demon with the tenacity of their race , until the place became accursed and banned of all living things .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 37]: Yet had they dug a little ditch , and permitted the invisible terror to flow quietly downwards until its potency was dissipated by sea and air , they might have mined the whole cliff with impunity .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 19]: The unfortunate unknown , J.S. -- he of the whitened bones -- might have done this thing too .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 32]: But he only possessed the half-knowledge of the working miner , and whilst shunning the plague-stricken quarry , adopted the more laborious method of making an adit to strike the deposit .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 16]: He succeeded , to perish miserably in the hour when he saw himself a millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 14]: Was this a portent of the fate about to overtake the latest comers ?
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 8]: Jenks , of course , stood up .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 17]: He always , stood square on his feet when the volcano within him fired his blood .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 7]: `` No , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 4]: he almost shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 7]: `` I will break the spell .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 40]: I am sent here by Providence , not to search for gold but to save a woman 's life , and if all the devils of China and Malay are in league against me I will beat them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 9]: The sound of his own voice startled him .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 10]: He had no notion that he was so hysterical .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 8]: Promptly his British phlegm throttled the demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 7]: He was rather ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 7]: What was all the fuss about ?
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 21]: With a barrow-load of gold he could not buy an instant 's safety for Iris , not to mention himself .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 6]: The language difficulty was insuperable .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 31]: Were it otherwise , the Dyaks would simply humbug him until he revealed the source of his wealth , and then murder him as an effective safeguard against foreign interference .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 2]: Iris !
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 18]: Not once since she was hurled ashore in his arms had Jenks so long forgotten her existence .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 5]: Should he tell her ?
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 18]: They were partners in everything appertaining to the island -- why keep this marvelous intelligence from her ?
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 17]: Yet was he tempted , not ignobly , but by reason of his love for her .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 35]: Once , years ago , when his arduous professional studies were distracted by a momentary infatuation for a fair face , a woman had proved fickle when tempted by greater wealth than he possessed .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 20]: For long he was a confirmed misogynist , to his great and lasting gain as a leader of men .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 26]: But with more equable judgment came a fixed resolution not to marry unless his prospective bride cared only for him and not for his position .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 20]: To a Staff Corps officer , even one with a small private income , this was no unattainable ideal .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 17]: Then he met with his _ débâcle _ in the shame and agony of the court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 19]: Whilst his soul still quivered under the lash of that terrible downfall , Iris came into his life .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: He knew not what might happen if they were rescued .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 46]: The time would quickly pass until the old order was resumed , she to go back to her position in society , he to become again a disgraced ex-officer , apparently working out a mere existence before the mast or handing plates in a saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 34]: Would it not be a sweet defiance of adversity were he able , even under such conditions , to win her love , and then disclose to her the potentialities of the island ?
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 5]: Perchance he might fail .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 19]: Though rich as Croesus he would still be under the social ban meted out to a cashiered officer .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 12]: She was a girl who could command the gift of coronets .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 20]: With restoration to her father and home , gratitude to her preserver would assuredly remain , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 7]: love might vanish like a mirage .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 6]: Then he would act honorably .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 16]: Half of the stored wealth would be hers to do as she chose with it .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 8]: Yes , this was a possible alternative .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 43]: In case of accident to himself , and her ultimate escape , he must immediately write full details of his discovery , and entrust the document to her , to be opened only after his death or six months after their release .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 13]: The idea possessed him so thoroughly that he could brook no delay .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 50]: He searched for one of the note-books taken from the dead officers of the _ Sirdar _ , and scribbled the following letter : `` DEAR MISS DEANE : `` Whether I am living or dead when you read these words , you will know that I love you .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 40]: Could I repeat that avowal a million times , in as many varied forms , I should find no better phrase to express the dream I have cherished since a happy fate permitted me to snatch you from death .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 11]: So I simply say , ' I love you . '
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 35]: I will continue to love you whilst life lasts , and it is my dearest hope that in the life beyond the grave I may still be able to voice my love for you .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 13]: `` But perhaps I am not destined to be loved by you .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 39]: Therefore , in the event of my death before you leave the island , I wish to give you instructions how to find a gold mine of great value which is hidden in the rock containing the cave .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 15]: You remember the sign on the piece of tin which we could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 38]: The figure 32 denotes the utmost depth of the excavation , and the 1 signifies that one foot below the surface , on reaching the face of the rock , there is a rich vein of gold .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 34]: The hollow on the other side of the cliff became filled with anhydrate gas , and this stopped the operations of the Chinese , who evidently knew of the existence of the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 15]: This is all the information the experts employed by Sir Arthur Deane will need .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 5]: The facts are unquestionable .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 19]: `` Assuming that I am alive , we will , of course , be co-partners in the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 39]: If I am dead , I wish one-sixth share to be given to my uncle , William Anstruther , Crossthwaite Manor , Northallerton , Yorkshire , as a recompense for his kindness to me during my early life .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 8]: The remainder is to be yours absolutely .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 5]: `` ROBERT ANSTRUTHER . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 17]: He read this remarkable document twice through to make sure that it exactly recorded his sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 14]: He even smiled sarcastically at the endowment of the uncle who disinherited him .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 33]: Then , satisfied with the perusal , he tore out the two leaves covered by the letter and began to devise a means of protecting it securely whilst in Iris 's possession .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 31]: At that moment he looked up and saw her coming towards him across the beach , brightly flushed after her bath , walking like a nymph clothed in tattered garments .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 17]: Perceiving that he was watching her , she waved her hand and instinctively quickened her pace .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 24]: Even now , when they were thrown together by the exigencies of each hour , she disliked to be long separated from him .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 9]: Instantly the scales fell from his mental vision .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 3]: Distrust Iris !
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 39]: Imagine for one second that riches or poverty , good repute or ill , would affect that loyal heart when its virginal font was filled with the love that once in her life comes to every true woman !
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 4]: Perish the thought !
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 21]: What evil spirit had power to so blind his perception of all that was strong and beautiful in her character .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 5]: Brave , uncomplaining Iris !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 6]: Iris of the crystal soul !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 19]: Iris , whose innocence and candor were mirrored in her blue eyes and breathed through her dear lips !
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 18]: Here was Othello acting as his own tempter , with not an Iago within a thousand miles .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 14]: Laughing at his fantastic folly , Jenks tore the letter into little pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 69]: It might have been wiser to throw the sheets into the embers of the fire close at hand , but for the nonce he was overpowered by the great awakening that had come to him , and he unconsciously murmured the musical lines of Tennyson 's `` Maud '' : `` She is coming , my own , my sweet ; Were it ever so airy a tread .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 47]: My heart would hear her and beat Were it earth in an earthy bed ; My dust would hear her and beat , Had I lain for a century dead , Would start and tremble under her feet , And blossom in purple and red . ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 9]: Do n't gaze at me in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 12]: I do n't look like a ghost , do I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 12]: cried Iris , when near enough to note his rapt expression .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: `` You would not object if I called you a vision ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 17]: he inquired quietly , averting his eyes lest they should speak more plainly than his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: `` Not if you meant it nicely .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 14]: But I fear that ` specter ' would be a more appropriate word .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 10]: _ V'la ma meilleure robe de sortie _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 17]: She spread out the front widths of her skirt , and certainly the prospect was lamentable .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 28]: The dress was so patched and mended , yet so full of fresh rents , that a respectable housemaid would hesitate before using it to clean fire-irons .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: `` Is that really your best dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 6]: This is my blue serge .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 14]: The brown cloth did not survive the soaking it received in salt water .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 8]: After a few days it simply crumbled .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 16]: The others are muslin or cotton , and have been -- er -- adapted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 13]: `` There is plenty of men 's clothing , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 14]: `` Unfortunately there is n't another island , '' she said , severely .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 23]: I meant that it might be possible to -- er -- contrive some sort of rig that will serve all purposes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 8]: `` But all my thread is gone .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 8]: I have barely a needleful left . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 15]: `` In that case we must fall back on our supply of hemp . ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 14]: `` I suppose that might be made to serve , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 12]: `` You are never at a loss for an expedient . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 11]: `` It will be a poor one , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 20]: But you can make up for it by buying some nice gowns at Doucet 's or Worth 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 4]: She laughed delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 24]: `` Perhaps in his joy at my reappearance my dear old dad may let me run riot in Paris on our way home .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 6]: But that will not last .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 20]: We are fairly well off , but I can not afford ten thousand a year for dress alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 21]: `` If any woman can afford such a sum for the purpose , you are at least her equal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 4]: Iris looked puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 19]: `` Is that your way of telling me that fine feathers would make me a fine bird ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: I intend my words to be understood in their ordinary sense .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 17]: You are very , very rich , Miss Deane -- an extravagantly wealthy young person . ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 10]: `` Of course you know you are talking nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 15]: Why , only the other day my father said -- '' `` Excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 15]: What is the average price of a walking-dress from a leading Paris house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 5]: `` Thirty pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 7]: `` And an evening dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 10]: `` Oh , anything , from fifty upwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 13]: He picked up a few pieces of quartz from the canvas sheet .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 19]: `` Here is your walking-dress , '' he said , handing her a lump weighing about a pound .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 24]: `` With the balance in the heap there you can stagger the best-dressed woman you meet at your first dinner in England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 9]: `` Do you mean by pelting her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 5]: she inquired , mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 4]: `` Far worse .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 8]: By wearing a more expensive costume . ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 10]: His manner was so earnest that he compelled seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 10]: Iris took the proffered specimen and looked at it .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 8]: `` From the cave , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 11]: I thought you said antimony was not very valuable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 6]: `` That is not antimony .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 4]: It is gold .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 13]: By chance I have hit upon an extremely rich lode of gold .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 14]: At the most modest computation it is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 12]: You and I are quite wealthy people , Miss Deane . ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: Iris opened her blue eyes very wide at this intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 6]: It took her breath away .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 12]: But her first words betokened her innate sense of fair dealing .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 5]: `` You and I !
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 3]: Wealthy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 30]: `` I am so glad for your sake , but tell me , pray , Mr. Jenks , what have _ I _ got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 9]: `` Are we not partners in this island ?
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 34]: By squatter 's right , if by no better title , we own land , minerals , wood , game , and even such weird belongings as ancient lights and fishing privileges . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: `` I do n't see that at all .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 52]: You find a gold mine , and coolly tell me that I am a half owner of it because you dragged me out of the sea , fed me , housed me , saved my life from pirates , and generally acted like a devoted nursemaid in charge of a baby .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 23]: Really , Mr. Jenks -- '' `` Really , Miss Deane , you will annoy me seriously if you say another word .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 11]: I absolutely refuse to listen to such an argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 25]: Her outrageously unbusiness-like utterances , treading fast on the heels of his own melodramatic and written views concerning their property , nettled him greatly .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 37]: Each downright syllable was a sting to his conscience , but of this Iris was blissfully unaware , else she would not have applied caustic to the rankling wound caused by his momentary distrust of her .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 20]: For some time they stood in silence , until the sailor commenced to reproach himself for his rough protest .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 8]: Perhaps he had hurt her sensitive feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 10]: What a brute he was , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 26]: She was only a child in ordinary affairs , and he ought to have explained things more lucidly and with greater command over his temper .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 32]: And all this time Iris 's face was dimpling with amusement , for she understood him so well that had he threatened to kill her she would have laughed at him .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 9]: `` Would you mind getting the lamp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 13]: he said softly , surprised to catch her expression of saucy humor .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 9]: `` Oh , please may I speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 18]: `` I do n't want to annoy you , but I am simply dying to talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 7]: He had forgotten his own injunction .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 12]: `` Let us first examine our mine , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 16]: `` If you bring the lamp we can have a good look at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 16]: Close scrutiny of the work already done merely confirmed the accuracy of his first impressions .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 18]: Whilst Iris held the light he opened up the seam with a few strokes of the pick .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 29]: Each few inches it broadened into a noteworthy volcanic dyke , now yellow in its absolute purity , at times a bluish black when fused with other metals .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 15]: The additional labor involved caused him to follow up the line of the fault .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 13]: Suddenly the flame of the lamp began to flicker in a draught .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 9]: There was an air-passage between cave and ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 42]: `` I am sorry , '' cried Jenks , desisting from further efforts , `` that I have not recently read one of Bret Harte 's novels , or I would speak to you in the language of the mining camp .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 23]: But in plain Cockney , Miss Deane , we are on to a good thing if only we can keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 8]: They came back into the external glare .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 14]: Iris was now so serious that she forgot to extinguish the little lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: She stood with outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 14]: `` There is a lot of money in there , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 6]: `` Tons of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 8]: `` No need to quarrel about division .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 9]: There is enough for both of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 4]: `` Quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 10]: We can even spare some for our friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 16]: He took so readily to this definition of their partnership that Iris suddenly became frigid .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 15]: Then she saw the ridiculous gleam of the tiny wick and blew it out .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 29]: `` I mean , '' she said , stiffly , `` that if you and I do agree to go shares we will each be very rich . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 13]: I applied your words to the mine alone , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 8]: A slight thing will shatter a daydream .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 3]: This sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 10]: The sailor resumed his task of burying the stores .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 6]: `` Poor little lamp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 3]: he thought .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 16]: `` When it came into the greater world how soon it was snuffed out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 16]: But Iris said to herself , `` What a silly slip that was of mine !
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 8]: Enough for both of us , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 9]: Does he expect me to propose to him ?
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: I wonder what the letter was about which he destroyed as I came back after my bath .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 8]: It must have been meant for me .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 6]: Why did he write it ?
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 8]: Why did he tear it up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 12]: The hour drew near when Jenks climbed to the Summit Rock .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 9]: He shouldered axe and rifle and set forth .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 9]: Iris heard him rustling upwards through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 32]: She set some water to boil for tea , and , whilst bringing a fresh supply of fuel , passed the spot where the torn scraps of paper littered the sand .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 31]: She was the soul of honor , for a woman , but there was never a woman yet who could take her eyes off a written document which confronted her .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 14]: She could not help seeing that one small morsel contained her own name .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 11]: Though mutilated it had clearly read -- Miss Deane . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 11]: `` So it _ was _ intended for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 13]: she cried , throwing down her bundle and dropping to her knees .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 10]: She secured that particular slip and examined it earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 16]: Not for worlds would she pick up all the scraps and endeavor to sort them .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 27]: Yet they had a fascination for her , and at this closer range she saw another which bore the legend -- `` I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 10]: Somehow the two seemed to fit together very nicely .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 14]: Yet a third carried the same words -- `` I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 6]: They were still quite coherent .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 9]: She did not want to look any further .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 19]: She did not even turn over such of the torn pieces as had fluttered to earth face downwards .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 22]: Opening the front of her bodice she brought to light a small gold locket containing miniatures of her father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 17]: Inside this receptacle she carefully placed the three really material portions of the sailor 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 24]: When Jenks walked down the hill again he heard her singing long before he caught sight of her , sedulously tending the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 13]: As he came near he perceived the remains of his useless document .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 15]: He stooped and gathered them up , forthwith throwing them among the glowing logs .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 16]: `` By the way , what were you writing whilst I had my bath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 5]: inquired Iris , demurely .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 7]: `` Some information about the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 13]: On second thoughts , however , I saw it was unnecessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 8]: `` Oh , was that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 5]: `` Practically all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 8]: `` Then some part was impracticable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 14]: He glanced sharply at her , but she was merely talking at random .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 21]: `` Well , you see , '' he explained , `` one can do so little without the requisite plant .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 22]: This sort of ore requires a crushing-mill , a smelting furnace , perhaps big tanks filled with cyanide of potassium . ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 24]: `` And , of course , although you can do wonders , you can not provide all those things , can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 8]: Jenks deemed this query to be unanswerable .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 8]: They were busy again until night fell .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 25]: Sitting down for a little while before retiring to rest , they discussed , for the hundredth time , the probabilities of speedy succor .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 21]: This led them to the topic of available supplies , and the sailor told Iris the dispositions he had made .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 10]: `` Did you bury the box of books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 9]: `` Yes , but not in the cave .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 11]: They are at the foot of the cinchona over there .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: Do you want any ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 26]: `` I have a Bible in my room , but there was a Tennyson among the others which I glanced at in spare moments . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 20]: The sailor thanked the darkness that concealed the deep bronze of face and neck caused by this chance remark .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 24]: He vaguely recollected the manner in which the lines from `` Maud '' came to his lips after the episode of the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 20]: Was it possible that he had unknowingly uttered them aloud and Iris was now slily poking fun at him ?
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 5]: He glowed with embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 17]: `` It is odd that you should mention Tennyson , '' he managed to say calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 12]: `` Only today I was thinking of a favorite passage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 11]: Iris , of course , was quite innocent this time .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 7]: `` Oh , do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 9]: Was it from ` Enoch Arden ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 7]: He gave a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 8]: Anything but that , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 6]: `` What then ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 5]: ` Maud . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 7]: `` Oh , ` Maud . '
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 25]: It is very beautiful , but I could never imagine why the poet gave such a sad ending to an idyllic love story . ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 8]: `` They too often end that way .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 15]: Moreover , ` Enoch Arden ' is not what you might call exhilarating . ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 4]: It is sad .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 19]: I have often thought he had the ` Sonata Pathétique ' in his mind when he wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 8]: But the note is mournful all through .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 13]: There is no promise of happiness as in ` Maud . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 10]: `` Then it is my turn to ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 12]: Why did you hit upon that poem among so many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 12]: `` Because it contains an exact description of our position here .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 27]: Do n't you remember how the poor fellow '' ` Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge , A shipwrecked sailor , waiting for a sail . '
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 95]: `` I am sure Tennyson saw our island with poetic eye , for he goes on -- '' ` No sail from day to day , but every day The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts Among the palms and ferns and precipices ; The blaze upon the waters to the east ; The blaze upon his island overhead ; The blaze upon the waters to the west ; Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven , The hollower-bellowing ocean , and again The scarlet shafts of sunrise -- but no sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 14]: She declaimed the melodious verse with a subtle skill that amazed her hearer .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 11]: Profoundly moved , Jenks dared not trust himself to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 20]: `` I read the whole poem the other day , '' she said after a silence of some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 12]: `` Sorrowful as it is , it comforted me by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 19]: How different will be our fate to his when ` another ship stays by this isle ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 26]: Yet neither of them knew that one line she had recited was more singularly applicable to their case than that which they paid heed to .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 22]: `` The great stars that globed themselves in Heaven , '' were shining clear and bright in the vast arch above .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: Resplendent amidst the throng rose the Pleiades , the mythological seven hailed by the Greeks as an augury of safe navigation .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 32]: And the Dyaks -- one of the few remaining savage races of the world -- share the superstition of the people who fashioned all the arts and most of the sciences .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 8]: The Pleiades form the Dyak tutelary genius .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 38]: Some among a bloodthirsty and vengeful horde were even then pointing to the clustering stars that promised quick voyage to the isle where their kinsmen had been struck down by a white man who rescued a maid .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 18]: Nevertheless , Grecian romance and Dyak lore alike relegate the influence of the Pleiades to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 9]: Other stars are needed to foster enterprise ashore .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 7]: CHAPTER X REALITY _ V _ .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 40]: ROMANCE -- THE CASE FOR THE PLAINTIFF Night after night the Pleiades swung higher in the firmament ; day after day the sailor perfected his defences and anxiously scanned the ocean for sign of friendly smoke or hostile sail .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 35]: This respite would not have been given to him , were it not for the lucky bullet which removed two fingers and part of a third from the right hand of the Dyak chief .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 33]: Not even a healthy savage can afford to treat such a wound lightly , and ten days elapsed before the maimed robber was able to move the injured limb without a curse .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 17]: Meanwhile , each night Jenks slept less soundly ; each day his face became more careworn .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 36]: He began to realize why the island had not been visited already by the vessel which would certainly be deputed to search for them -- she was examining the great coast-line of China and Siam .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 24]: It was his habit to mark the progress of time on the rudely made sun-dial which sufficiently served their requirements as a clock .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 19]: Iris happened to watch him chipping the forty-fourth notch on the edge of the horizontal block of wood .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 10]: `` Have we really been forty-four days here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 11]: she inquired , after counting the marks with growing astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 12]: `` I believe the reckoning is accurate , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 23]: `` The _ Sirdar _ was lost on the 18th of March , and I make this the 1st of May . ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 5]: `` May Day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 9]: Shall we drive to Hurlingham this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 30]: `` Looked at in that way it seems to be a tremendous time , though indeed , in some respects , it figures in my mind like many years .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 7]: That is when I am thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 12]: Otherwise , when busy , the days fly like hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 13]: `` It must be convenient to have such an elastic scale . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 4]: `` Most useful .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 13]: I strive to apply the quick rate when you are grumpy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 25]: Iris placed her arms akimbo , planted her feet widely apart , and surveyed Jenks with an expression that might almost be termed impudent .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 10]: They were great friends , these two , now .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 17]: The incipient stage of love-making had been dropped entirely , as ludicrously unsuited to their environment .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 53]: When the urgent necessity for continuous labor no longer spurred them to exertion during every moment of daylight , they tackled the box of books and read , not volumes which appealed to them in common , but quaint tomes in the use of which Jenks was tutor and Iris the scholar .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 24]: It became a fixed principle with the girl that she was very ignorant , and she insisted that the sailor should teach her .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 34]: For instance , among the books he found a treatise on astronomy ; it yielded a keen delight to both to identify a constellation and learn all sorts of wonderful things concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 21]: But to work even the simplest problem required a knowledge of algebra , and Iris had never gone beyond decimals .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 27]: So the stock of notebooks , instead of recording their experiences , became covered with symbols showing how x plus y equaled x ² minus 3,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 11]: As a variant , Jenks introduced a study of Hindustani .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 16]: His method was to write a short sentence and explain in detail its component parts .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 30]: With a certain awe Iris surveyed the intricacies of the Urdu compound verb , but , about her fourth lesson , she broke out into exclamations of extravagant joy .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 10]: `` What on earth is the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 5]: demanded her surprised mentor .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 7]: `` Do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 5]: she exclaimed , delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 7]: `` Of course you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 14]: People who know a lot about a thing often miss its obvious points .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 8]: I have discovered how to write Kiplingese .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 25]: All you have to do is to tell your story in Urdu , translate it literally into English , and there you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 4]: `` Quite so .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 14]: Just do it as Kipling does , and the secret is laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 13]: By the same rule you can hit upon the Miltonic adjective . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 5]: Iris tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 19]: `` I do n't know anything about the Miltonic adjective , but I am sure about Kipling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 5]: This ended the argument .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 41]: She knitted her brows in the effort to master the ridiculous complexities of a language which , instead of simply saying `` Take '' or `` Bring , '' compels one to say `` Take-go '' and `` Take-come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 12]: One problem defied solution -- that of providing raiment for Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 20]: The united skill of the sailor and herself would not induce unraveled cordage to supply the need of thread .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 20]: It was either too weak or too knotty , and meanwhile the girl 's clothes were falling to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 34]: Jenks tried the fibers of trees , the sinews of birds -- every possible expedient he could hit upon -- and perhaps , after experiments covering some weeks , he might have succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 22]: But modern dress stuffs , weakened by aniline dyes and stiffened with Chinese clay , permit of no such exhaustive research .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 49]: It must be remembered that the lady passengers on board the _ Sirdar _ were dressed to suit the tropics , and the hard usage given by Iris to her scanty stock was never contemplated by the Manchester or Bradford looms responsible for the durability of the material .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 9]: As the days passed the position became irksome .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 27]: It even threatened complete callapse during some critical moment , and the two often silently surveyed the large number of merely male garments in their possession .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 16]: Of course , in the matter of coats and waistcoats there was no difficulty whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 13]: Iris had long been wearing those portions of the doctor 's uniform .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 20]: But when it came to the rest -- At last , one memorable morning , she crossed the Rubicon .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 12]: Jenks had climbed , as usual , to the Summit Rock .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 41]: He came back with the exciting news that he thought -- he could not be certain , but there were indications inspiring hopefulness -- that towards the west of the far-off island he could discern the smoke of a steamer .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 26]: Though he had eyes for a faint cloud of vapor at least fifty miles distant he saw nothing of a remarkable change effected nearer home .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 49]: Outwardly , Iris was attired in her wonted manner , but if her companion 's mind were not wholly monopolized by the bluish haze detected on the horizon , he must have noticed the turned-up ends of a pair of trousers beneath the hem of her tattered skirt .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 43]: It did occur to him that Iris received his momentous announcement with an odd air of hauteur , and it was passing strange she did not offer to accompany him when , after bolting his breakfast , he returned to the observatory .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 18]: He came back in an hour , and the lines on his face were deeper than before .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 16]: `` A false alarm , '' he said curtly in response to her questioning look .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 21]: And that was all , though she nerved herself to walk steadily past him on her way to the well .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 14]: This was disconcerting , even annoying to a positive young woman like Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 12]: Resolving to end the ordeal , she stood rigidly before him .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 14]: `` Well , '' she said , `` I 've done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 5]: `` Have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 5]: he exclaimed , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 27]: They 're a little too long , and I feel very awkward , but they 're better than -- than my poor old dress unsupported . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 22]: She blushed furiously , to the sailor 's complete bewilderment , but she bravely persevered and stretched out an unwilling foot .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 3]: `` Oh .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 4]: I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 8]: he growled , and he too reddened .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 11]: `` I ca n't help it , can I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 4]: she demanded piteously .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 12]: `` It is not unlike a riding-habit , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 7]: Then his ready wit helped him .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 9]: `` An excellent compromise , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 9]: `` A process of evolution , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 18]: Now , do you know , Miss Deane , that would never have occurred to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 16]: And during the remainder of the day he did not once look at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 47]: Indeed , he had far more serious matters to distract his thoughts , for Iris , feverishly anxious to be busy , suddenly suggested that it would be a good thing were she able to use a rifle if a fight at close quarters became necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 43]: The recoil of the Lee-Metford is so slight that any woman can manipulate the weapon with effect , provided she is not called upon to fire from a standing position , in which case the weight is liable to cause bad aiming .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 15]: Though it came rather late in the day , Jenks caught at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 14]: He accustomed her in the first instance to the use of blank cartridges .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 33]: Then , when fairly proficient in holding and sighting -- a child can learn how to refill the clip and eject each empty shell -- she fired ten rounds of service ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 36]: The target was a white circle on a rock at eighty yards , and those of the ten shots that missed the absolute mark would have made an enemy at the same distance extremely uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: Iris was much pleased with her proficiency .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 21]: `` Now , '' she cried , `` instead of being a hindrance to you I may be some help .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 27]: In any case , the Dyaks will think there are two men to face , and they have good reason to fear one of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 8]: Then a new light dawned upon Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 11]: `` Why did you not think of it before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 16]: `` Do n't you see , Miss Deane , the possibility suggested by your words ?
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 40]: I am sorry to be compelled to speak plainly , but I feel sure that if those scoundrels do attack us in force it will be more to secure you than to avenge the loss of their fellow tribesmen .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 12]: First and foremost , the sea-going Dyaks are pirates and marauders .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 18]: They prowl about the coast looking not so much for a fight as for loot and women .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 32]: Now , if they return , and apparently find two well-armed men awaiting them , with no prospect of plunder , there is a chance they may abandon the enterprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 8]: Iris did not flinch from the topic .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 7]: She well knew its grave importance .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 23]: `` In other words , '' she said , `` I must be seen by them dressed only in male clothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 11]: `` Yes , as a last resource , that is .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 19]: I have some hope that they may not discover our whereabouts owing to the precautions we have adopted .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 24]: Perched up there on the ledge we will be profoundly uncomfortable , but that will be nothing if it secures our safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 7]: She did not reply at once .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: Then she said musingly -- `` Forty-four days !
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 20]: Surely there has been ample time to scour the China Sea from end to end in search of us ?
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 26]: My father would never abandon hope until he had the most positive knowledge that the _ Sirdar _ was lost with all on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 23]: The sailor , through long schooling , was prepared with an answer -- `` Each day makes the prospect of escape brighter .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 22]: Though I was naturally disappointed this morning , I must state quite emphatically that our rescue may come any hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 6]: Iris looked at him steadily .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 17]: `` You wear a solemn face for one who speaks so cheerfully , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 11]: `` You should not attach too great significance to appearances .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 16]: The owl , a very stupid bird , is noted for its philosophical expression . ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 11]: `` Then we will strive to find wisdom in words .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 25]: Do you remember , Mr. Jenks , that soon after the wreck you told me we might have to remain here many months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 8]: `` That was a pardonable exaggeration . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 5]: It was the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 12]: You are seeking now to buoy me up with false hope .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 20]: It is sixteen hundred miles from Hong Kong to Singapore , and half as much from Siam to Borneo .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 13]: The _ Sirdar _ might have been driven anywhere in the typhoon .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 10]: Did n't you say so , Mr. Jenks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 7]: He wavered under this merciless cross-examination .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 17]: `` I had no idea your memory was so good , '' he said , weakly .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 7]: `` Excellent , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 15]: Moreover , during our forty-four days together , you have taught me to think .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 8]: Why do you adopt subterfuge with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 7]: We are partners in all else .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 14]: Why can not I share your despair as well as your toil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 24]: She blazed out in sudden wrath , and he understood that she would not be denied the full extent of his secret fear .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 16]: He bowed reverently before her , as a mortal paying homage to an angry goddess .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 14]: `` I can only admit that you are right , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 14]: `` We must pray that God will direct our friends to this island .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 23]: Otherwise we may not be found for a year , as unhappily the fishermen who once came here now avoid the place .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 14]: They have been frightened by the contents of the hollow behind the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 13]: I am glad you have solved the difficulty unaided , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 33]: I have striven at times to be coarse , even brutal , towards you , but my heart flinched from the task of telling you the possible period of your imprisonment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 61]: Then Iris , for the first time in many days , wept bitterly , and Jenks , blind to the true cause of her emotion , picked up a rifle to which , in spare moments , he had affixed a curious device , and walked slowly across Prospect Park towards the half-obliterated road leading to the Valley of Death .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 9]: The girl watched him disappear among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 9]: Through her tears shone a sorrowful little smile .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 15]: `` He thinks only of me , never of himself , '' she communed .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 24]: `` If it pleases Providence to spare us from these savages , what does it matter to me how long we remain here ?
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 11]: I have never been so happy before in my life .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 8]: I fear I never will be again .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 20]: If it were not for my father 's terrible anxiety I would not have a care in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 21]: I only wish to get away , so that one brave soul at least may be rid of needless tortures .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 14]: All his worry is on my account , none on his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 16]: That was what tearful Miss Iris thought , or tried to persuade herself to think .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: Perhaps her cogitations would not bear strict analysis .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 26]: Perhaps she harbored a sweet hope that the future might yet contain bright hours for herself and the man who was so devoted to her .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 60]: She refused to believe that Robert Anstruther , strong of arm and clear of brain , a Knight of the Round Table in all that was noble and chivalric , would permit his name to bear an unwarrantable stigma when -- and she blushed like a June rose -- he came to tell her that which he had written .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 17]: The sailor returned hastily , with the manner of one hurrying to perform a neglected task .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 25]: Without any explanation to Iris he climbed several times to the ledge , carrying arm-loads of grass roots which he planted in full view .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 38]: Then he entered the cave , and , although he was furnished only with the dim light that penetrated through the distant exit , she heard him hewing manfully at the rock for a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 29]: At last he emerged , grimy with dust and perspiration , just in time to pay a last visit to Summit Rock before the sun sank to rest .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 34]: He asked the girl to delay somewhat the preparations for their evening meal , as he wished to take a bath , so it was quite dark when they sat down to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 11]: Iris had long recovered her usual state of high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 11]: `` Why were you burrowing in the cavern again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 11]: `` Are you in a hurry to get rich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 15]: `` I was following an air-shaft , not a lode , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 15]: `` I am occasionally troubled with after wit , and this is an instance .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 19]: Do you remember how the flame of the lamp flickered whilst we were opening up our mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 24]: `` I was so absorbed in contemplating our prospective wealth that I failed to pay heed to the true significance of that incident .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 11]: It meant the existence of an upward current of air .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 60]: Now , where the current goes there must be a passage , and whilst I was busy this afternoon among the trees over there , '' -- he pointed towards the Valley of Death -- `` it came to me like an inspiration that possibly a few hours ' hewing and delving might open a shaft to the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 9]: I have been well rewarded for the effort .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 25]: The stuff in the vault is so eaten away by water that it is no more solid than hard mud for the most part .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 12]: Already I have scooped out a chimney twelve feet high . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 8]: `` What good can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 17]: `` At present we have only a front door -- up the face of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 20]: When my work is completed , before tomorrow night I hope , we shall have a back door also .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: Of course I may encounter unforeseen obstacles as I advance .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 24]: A twist in the fault would be nearly fatal , but I am praying that it may continue straight to the ledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 13]: `` I still do n't see the great advantage to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 9]: `` The advantages are many , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 17]: The more points of attack presented by the enemy the more effective will be our resistance .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 32]: I doubt if they would ever be able to rush the cave were we to hold it , whereas I can go up and down our back staircase whenever I choose .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 24]: If you do n't mind being left in the dark I will resume work now , by the light of your lamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: But Iris protested against this arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 4]: She felt lonely .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 11]: The long hours of silence had been distasteful to her .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: She wanted to talk .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 26]: `` I agree , '' said Jenks , `` provided you do not pin me down to something I told you a month ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 4]: `` I promise .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 14]: You can tell me as much or as little as you think fit .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 9]: The subject for discussion is your court-martial . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 26]: He could not see the tender light in her eyes , but the quiet sympathy of her voice restrained the protest prompt on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 19]: Yet he blurted out , after a slight pause -- `` That is a very unsavory subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 4]: `` Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 6]: I do not think so .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 33]: I am a friend , Mr. Jenks , not an old one , I admit , but during the past six weeks we have bridged an ordinary acquaintanceship of as many years .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: Can you not trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 3]: Trust her ?
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 4]: He laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 20]: Then , choosing his words with great deliberation , he answered -- `` Yes , I can trust you .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 10]: I intended to tell you the story some day .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 5]: Why not tonight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 18]: Unseen in the darkness Iris 's hand sought and clasped the gold locket suspended from her neck .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 12]: She already knew some portion of the story he would tell .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 7]: The remainder was of minor importance .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 22]: `` It is odd , '' he continued , `` that you should have alluded to six years a moment ago .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 17]: It is exactly six years , almost to a day , since the trouble began . ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 6]: `` With Lord Ventnor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 6]: The name slipped out involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 41]: I was then a Staff Corps subaltern , and my proficiency in native languages attracted the attention of a friend in Simla , who advised me to apply for an appointment on the political side of the Government of India .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 4]: I did so .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 25]: He supported the application , and I was assured of the next vacancy in a native state , provided that I got married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 10]: He drawled out the concluding words with exasperating slowness .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 22]: Iris , astounded by the stipulation , dropped her locket and leaned forward into the red light of the log fire .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 12]: The sailor 's quick eye caught the glitter of the ornament .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 20]: `` By the way , '' he interrupted , `` what is that thing shining on your breast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: She instantly clasped the trinket again .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 23]: `` It is my sole remaining adornment , '' she said ; `` a present from my father on my tenth birthday .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 5]: Pray go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 19]: `` I was not a marrying man , Miss Deane , and the requisite qualification nearly staggered me .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 23]: But I looked around the station , and came to the conclusion that the Commissioner 's niece would make a suitable wife .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 17]: I regarded her ` points , ' so to speak , and they filled the bill .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 23]: She was smart , good-looking , lively , understood the art of entertaining , was first-rate in sports and had excellent teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 23]: Indeed , if a man selected a wife as he does a horse , she -- '' `` Do n't be horrid .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 6]: Was she really pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: `` I believe so .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 6]: People said she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 10]: `` But what did _ you _ think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 9]: `` At the time my opinion was biased .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 11]: I have seen her since , and she wears badly .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 13]: She is married now , and after thirty grew very fat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 3]: Artful Jenks !
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 7]: Iris settled herself comfortably to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 16]: `` I have jumped that fence with a lot in hand , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 10]: `` We became engaged , '' he said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 11]: `` She threw herself at him , '' communed Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 10]: `` Her name was Elizabeth -- Elizabeth Morris . ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 16]: The young lieutenant of those days called her `` Bessie , '' but no matter .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 19]: `` Well , you did n't marry her , anyhow , '' commented Iris , a trifle sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 10]: And now the sailor was on level ground again .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 12]: `` Thank Heaven , no , '' he said , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 19]: `` We had barely become engaged when she went with her uncle to Simla for the hot weather .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 46]: There she met Lord Ventnor , who was on the Viceroy 's staff , and -- if you do n't mind , we will skip a portion of the narrative -- I discovered then why men in India usually go to England for their wives .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 50]: Whilst in Simla on ten days ' leave I had a foolish row with Lord Ventnor in the United Service Club -- hammered him , in fact , in defence of a worthless woman , and was only saved from a severe reprimand because I had been badly treated .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 32]: Nevertheless , my hopes of a political appointment vanished , and I returned to my regiment to learn , after due reflection , what a very lucky person I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 9]: `` Concerning Miss Morris , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 5]: And now exit Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 15]: Not being cut out for matrimonial enterprise I tried to become a good officer .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 23]: A year ago , when Government asked for volunteers to form Chinese regiments , I sent in my name and was accepted .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 35]: I had the good fortune to serve under an old friend , Colonel Costobell ; but some malign star sent Lord Ventnor to the Far East , this time in an important civil capacity .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 17]: I met him occasionally , and we found we did not like each other any better .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 14]: My horse beat his for the Pagoda Hurdle Handicap -- poor old Sultan !
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 8]: I wonder where he is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 10]: `` Was your horse called ` Sultan ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 19]: I bought him in Meerut , trained him myself , and ferried him all the way to China .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 10]: I loved him next to the British Army . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 5]: This was quite satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 9]: There was genuine feeling in his voice now .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 6]: Iris became even more interested .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 25]: `` Colonel Costobell fell ill , and the command of the regiment devolved upon me , our only major being absent in the interior .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 19]: The Colonel 's wife unhappily chose that moment to flirt , as people say , with Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 23]: Not having learnt the advisability of minding my own business , I remonstrated with her , thus making her my deadly enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 18]: Lord Ventnor contrived an official mission to a neighboring town and detailed me for the military charge .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 6]: I sent a junior officer .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 47]: Then Mrs. Costobell and he deliberately concocted a plot to ruin me -- he , for the sake of his old animosity -- you remember that I had also crossed his path in Egypt -- she , because she feared I would speak to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 24]: On pretence of seeking my advice , she inveigled me at night into a deserted corner of the Club grounds at Hong Kong .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 32]: Lord Ventnor appeared , and as the upshot of their vile statements , which created an immediate uproar , I -- well , Miss Deane , I nearly killed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 20]: Iris vividly recalled the anguish he betrayed when this topic was inadvertently broached one day early in their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 33]: Now he was reciting his painful history with the air of a man far more concerned to be scrupulously accurate than aroused in his deepest passions by the memory of past wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 12]: What had happened in the interim to blunt these bygone sufferings ?
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 5]: Iris clasped her locket .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 5]: She thought she knew .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 14]: `` The remainder may be told in a sentence , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 21]: `` Of what avail were my frenzied statements against the definite proofs adduced by Lord Ventnor and his unfortunate ally ?
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 11]: Even her husband believed her and became my bitter foe .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 3]: Poor woman !
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 10]: I have it in my heart to pity her .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 6]: Well , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 5]: I am here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 10]: `` Can a man be ruined so easily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 17]: murmured the girl , her exquisite tact leading her to avoid any direct expression of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: `` It seems so .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 7]: But I have had my reward .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 17]: If ever I meet Mrs. Costobell again I will thank her for a great service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 5]: Iris suddenly became confused .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 12]: Her brow and neck tingled with a quick access of color .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 8]: `` Why do you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 27]: she asked ; and Jenks , who was rising , either did not hear , or pretended not to hear , the tremor in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 30]: `` Because you once told me you would never marry Lord Ventnor , and after what I have told you now I am quite sure you will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 12]: `` Ah , then you _ do _ trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 4]: she almost whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 9]: He forced back the words trembling for utterance .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 12]: He even strove weakly to assume an air of good-humored badinage .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 17]: `` See how you have tempted me from work , Miss Deane , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 14]: `` We have gossiped here until the fire grew tired of our company .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 9]: To bed , please , at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 7]: Iris caught him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 35]: `` I will pray tonight , and every night , '' she said solemnly , `` that your good name may be cleared in the eyes of all men as it is in mine .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 11]: And I am sure my prayer will be answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 12]: She passed into her chamber , but her angelic influence remained .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 19]: In his very soul the man thanked God for the tribulation which brought this woman into his life .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 13]: He had traversed the wilderness to find an oasis of rare beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 10]: What might lie beyond he neither knew nor cared .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 40]: Through the remainder of his existence , be it a day or many a year , he would be glorified by the knowledge that in one incomparable heart he reigned supreme , unchallenged , if only for the hour .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 24]: Fatigue , anxiety , bitter recollection and present danger , were overwhelmed and forgotten in the nearness , the intangible presence of Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 21]: He looked up to the starry vault , and , yielding to the spell , he , too , prayed .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: It was a beautiful night .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 32]: After a baking hot day the rocks were radiating their stored-up heat , but the pleasant south-westerly breeze that generally set in at sunset tempered the atmosphere and made sleep refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 16]: Jenks could not settle down to rest for a little while after Iris left him .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 35]: She did not bring forth her lamp , and , unwilling to disturb her , he picked up a resinous branch , lit it in the dying fire , and went into the cave .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 32]: He wanted to survey the work already done , and to determine whether it would be better to resume operations in the morning from inside the excavation or from the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 43]: Owing to the difficulty of constructing a vertical upward shaft , and the danger of a sudden fall of heavy material , he decided in favor of the latter course , although it entailed lifting all the refuse out of the hole .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 44]: To save time , therefore , he carried his mining tools into the open , placed in position the _ cheval de frise _ long since constructed for the defence of the entrance , and poured water over the remains of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 18]: This was his final care each night before stretching his weary limbs on his couch of branches .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 42]: It caused delay in the morning , but he neglected no precaution , and there was a possible chance of the Dyaks failing to discover the Eagle 's Nest if they were persuaded by other indications that the island was deserted .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 25]: He entered the hut and was in the act of pulling off his boots , when a distant shot rang sharply through the air .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 9]: It was magnified tenfold by the intense silence .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 38]: For a few seconds that seemed to be minutes he listened , cherishing the quick thought that perhaps a turtle , wandering far beyond accustomed limits , had disturbed one of the spring-gun communications on the sands .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 23]: A sputtering volley , which his trained ear recognized as the firing of muzzle-loaders , sounded the death-knell of his last hope .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 5]: The Dyaks had landed !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 23]: Coming silently and mysteriously in the dead of night , they were themselves the victims of a stratagem they designed to employ .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 23]: Instead of taking the occupants of Rainbow Island unawares they were startled at being greeted by a shot the moment they landed .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 26]: The alarmed savages at once retaliated by firing their antiquated weapons point-blank at the trees , thus giving warning enough to wake the Seven Sleepers .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 11]: Iris , fully dressed , was out in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 6]: `` They have come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 31]: `` Yes , '' was the cheery answer , for Jenks face to face with danger was a very different man to Jenks wrestling with the insidious attacks of Cupid .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 5]: `` Up the ladder !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 3]: Be lively !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 21]: They will not be here for half an hour if they kick up such a row at the first difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 8]: Still , we will take no risks .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 20]: Cast down those spare lines when you reach the top and haul away when I say ` Ready ! '
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 10]: You will find everything to hand up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 16]: He held the bottom of the ladder to steady it for the girl 's climb .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 16]: Soon her voice fell , like a message from a star -- `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 6]: Please join me soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 11]: The coiled-up ropes dropped along the face of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 34]: Clothes , pick , hatchet , hammer , crowbars , and other useful odds and ends were swung away into the darkness , for the moon as yet did not illumine the crag .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 16]: The sailor darted into Belle Vue Castle and kicked their leafy beds about the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 37]: Then he slung all the rifles , now five in number , over his shoulders , and mounted the rope-ladder , which , with the spare cords , he drew up and coiled with careful method .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 19]: `` By the way , '' he suddenly asked , `` have you your sou ` wester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: `` And your Bible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 8]: It rests beneath my head every night .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 7]: I even brought our Tennyson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 19]: `` Ah , '' he growled fiercely , `` this is where the reality differs from the romance .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 8]: Our troubles are only beginning now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 7]: `` They will end the sooner .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 11]: For my part , I have utter faith in you .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 25]: If it be God 's will , we will escape ; and no man is more worthy than you to be His agent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 33]: CHAPTER XI THE FIGHT The sailor knew so accurately the position of his reliable sentinels that he could follow each phase of the imaginary conflict on the other side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 63]: The first outbreak of desultory firing died away amidst a chorus of protest from every feathered inhabitant of the isle , so Jenks assumed that the Dyaks had gathered again on the beach after riddling the scarecrows with bullets or slashing them with their heavy razor-edged parangs , Malay swords with which experts can fell a stout sapling at a single blow .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 29]: A hasty council was probably held , and , notwithstanding their fear of the silent company in the hollow , an advance was ultimately made along the beach .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 14]: Within a few yards they encountered the invisible cord of the third spring-gun .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 12]: There was a report , and another fierce outbreak of musketry .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 4]: This was enough .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 14]: Not a man would move a step nearer that abode of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 12]: The next commotion arose on the ridge near the North Cape .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 25]: `` At this rate of progress , '' said Jenks to the girl , `` they will not reach our house until daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 14]: `` I almost wish they were here , '' was the quiet reply .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 15]: `` I find this waiting and listening to be trying to the nerves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 26]: They were lying on a number of ragged garments hastily spread on the ledge , and peering intently into the moonlit area of Prospect Park .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 10]: The great rock itself was shrouded in somber shadows .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 21]: Even if they stood up none could see them from the ground , so dense was the darkness enveloping them .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 8]: He turned slightly and took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: It was cool and moist .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 8]: It no more trembled than his own .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 17]: `` The Dyaks are far more scared than you , '' he murmured with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 16]: `` Cruel and courageous as they are , they dare not face a spook . ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 18]: `` Then what a pity it is we can not conjure up a ghost for their benefit !
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 11]: All the spirits I have ever read about were ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 9]: Why can not one be useful occasionally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 6]: The question set him thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 20]: Unknown to the girl , the materials for a dramatic apparition were hidden amidst the bushes near the well .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 25]: He cudgeled his brains to remember the stage effects of juvenile days ; but these needed limelight , blue flares , mirrors , phosphorus .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 33]: The absurdity of hoping to devise any such accessories whilst perched on a ledge in a remote island -- a larger reef of the thousands in the China Sea -- tickled him .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 3]: asked Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 9]: He repeated his list of missing stage properties .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 24]: They had nothing to do but to wait , and people in the very crux and maelstrom of existence usually discuss trivial things .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 44]: `` I do n't know anything about phosphorus , '' said the girl , `` but you can obtain queer results from sulphur , and there is an old box of Norwegian matches resting at this moment on the shelf in my room .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 5]: Do n't you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 15]: They were in your pocket , and you were going to throw them away .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 8]: Why , what are you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 14]: For Jenks had cast the rope-ladder loose and was evidently about to descend .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 19]: `` Have no fear , '' he said ; `` I will not be away five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 12]: `` If you are going down I must come with you .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 9]: I will not be left here alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 12]: `` Please do not stop me , '' he whispered earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 6]: `` You must not come .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 7]: I will take no risk whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 10]: If you remain here you can warn me instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 13]: With both of us on the ground we will incur real danger .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 19]: I want you to keep a sharp lookout towards Turtle Beach in case the Dyaks come that way .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 16]: Those who are crossing the island will not reach us for a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 6]: She yielded , though unwillingly .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 9]: She was tremulous with anxiety on his account .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 6]: He vanished without another word .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 11]: She next saw him in the moonlight near the well .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 31]: He was rustling among the shrubs , and he returned to the rock with something white in his arms , which he seemingly deposited at the mouth of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: He went back to the well and carried another similar burthen .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 7]: Then he ran towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 25]: The doorway was not visible from the ledge , and she passed a few horrible moments until a low hiss beneath caught her ear .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 14]: She could tell by the creak of the rope-ladder that he was ascending .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 23]: At last he reached her side , and she murmured , with a gasping sob -- `` Do n't go away again .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 7]: I can not stand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 12]: He thought it best to soothe her agitation by arousing interest .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 26]: Still hauling in the ladder with one hand , he held out the other , on which luminous wisps were writhing like glow-worms ' ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 9]: `` You are responsible , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 18]: `` You gave me an excellent idea , and I was obliged to carry it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 7]: `` What have you done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 10]: `` Arranged a fearsome bogey in the cave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 5]: `` But how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 23]: `` It was not exactly a pleasant operation , but the only laws of necessity are those which must be broken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 13]: She understood that he did not wish her to question him further .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 49]: Perhaps curiosity , now that he was safe , might have vanquished her terror , and led to another demand for enlightenment , but at that instant the sound of an angry voice and the crunching of coral away to the left drove all else from her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 17]: `` They are coming by way of the beach , after all , '' whispered Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 8]: He was mistaken , in a sense .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 31]: Another outburst of intermittent firing among the trees on the north of the ridge showed that some , at least , of the Dyaks were advancing by their former route .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 52]: The appearance of the Dyak chief on the flat belt of shingle , with his right arm slung across his breast , accompanied by not more than half a dozen followers , showed that a few hardy spirits had dared to pass the Valley of Death with all its nameless terrors .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 11]: They advanced cautiously enough , as though dreading a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 25]: The chief carried a bright parang in his left hand ; the others were armed with guns , their swords being thrust through belts .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 35]: Creeping forward on tip-toe , though their distant companions were making a tremendous row , they looked a murderous gang as they peered across the open space , now brilliantly illuminated by the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 19]: Jenks had a sudden intuition that the right thing to do now was to shoot the whole party .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: He dismissed the thought at once .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 21]: All his preparations were governed by the hope that the pirates might abandon their quest after hours of fruitless search .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 14]: It would be most unwise , he told himself , to precipitate hostilities .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 22]: Far better avoid a conflict altogether , if that were possible , than risk the immediate discovery of his inaccessible retreat .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 27]: In other words he made a grave mistake , which shows how a man may err when over-agonized by the danger of the woman he loves .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 8]: The bold course was the right one .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 21]: By killing the Dyak leader he would have deprived the enemy of the dominating influence in this campaign of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 57]: When the main body , already much perturbed by the unseen and intangible agencies which opened fire at them in the wood , arrived in Prospect Park to find only the dead bodies of their chief and his small force , their consternation could be turned into mad panic by a vigorous bombardment from the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 33]: Probably , in less than an hour after their landing , the whole tribe would have rushed pell-mell to the boats , cursing the folly which led them to this devil-haunted island .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 13]: But it serves no good purpose to say what might have been .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 34]: As it was the Dyaks , silent now and moving with the utmost caution , passed the well , and were about to approach the cave when one of them saw the house .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 6]: Instantly they changed their tactics .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 18]: Retreating hastily to the shade of the opposite cliff they seemed to await the coming of reinforcements .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 53]: The sailor fancied that a messenger was dispatched by way of the north sands to hurry up the laggards , because the distant firing slackened , and , five minutes later , a fierce outbreak of yells among the trees to the right heralded a combined rush on the Belle Vue Castle .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 54]: The noise made by the savages was so great -- the screams of bewildered birds circling overhead so incessant -- that Jenks was compelled to speak quite loudly when he said to Iris -- `` They must think we sleep soundly not to be disturbed by the volleys they have fired already . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 37]: She would have answered , but he placed a restraining hand on her shoulder , for the Dyaks quickly discovering that the hut was empty , ran towards the cave and thus came in full view .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 34]: As well as Jenks could judge , the foremost trio of the yelping horde were impaled on the bayonets of the _ cheval de frise _ , learning too late its formidable nature .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 22]: The wounded men shrieked in agony , but their cries were drowned in a torrent of amazed shouts from their companions .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 35]: Forthwith there was a stampede towards the well , the cliff , the beaches , anywhere to get away from that awesome cavern where ghosts dwelt and men fell maimed at the very threshold .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 39]: The sailor , leaning as far over the edge of the rock as the girl 's expostulations would permit , heard a couple of men groaning beneath , whilst a third limped away with frantic and painful haste .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 10]: whispered Iris , eager herself to witness the tumult .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 6]: `` What has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 20]: `` They have been routed by a box of matches and a few dried bones , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: There was no time for further speech .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 12]: He was absorbed in estimating the probable number of the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 9]: Thus far , he had seen about fifty .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 22]: Moreover , he did not wish to acquaint Iris with the actual details of the artifice that had been so potent .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 42]: Her allusion to the box of water-sodden Tändstickors gave him the notion of utilizing as an active ally the bleached remains of the poor fellow who had long ago fallen a victim to this identical mob of cut-throats or their associates .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 57]: He gathered the principal bones from their resting-place near the well , rubbed them with the ends of the matches after damping the sulphur again , and arranged them with ghastly effect on the pile of rubbish at the further end of the cave , creeping under the _ cheval de frise _ for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 26]: Though not so vivid as he wished , the pale-glimmering headless skeleton in the intense darkness of the interior was appalling enough in all conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 12]: Fortunately the fumes of the sulphur fed on the bony substance .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 26]: They endured a sufficient time to scare every Dyak who caught a glimpse of the monstrous object crouching in luminous horror within the dismal cavern .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 28]: Not even the stirring exhortations of the chief , whose voice was raised in furious speech , could induce his adherents to again approach that affrighting spot .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 21]: At last the daring scoundrel himself , still wielding his naked sword , strode right up to the very doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 13]: Stricken with sudden stupor , he gazed at the fitful gleams within .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 12]: He prodded the _ cheval de frise _ with the parang .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 7]: Here was something definite and solid .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 13]: Then he dragged one of the wounded men out into the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 22]: Again Jenks experienced an itching desire to send a bullet through the Dyak 's head ; again he resisted the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 17]: And so passed that which is vouchsafed by Fate to few men -- a second opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 24]: Another vehement harangue by the chief goaded some venturesome spirits into carrying their wounded comrade out of sight , presumably to the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 36]: Inspired by their leader 's fearless example , they even removed the third injured Dyak from the vicinity of the cave , but the celerity of their retreat caused the wretch to bawl in agony .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 42]: Their next undertaking was no sooner appreciated by the sailor than he hurriedly caused Iris to shelter herself beneath the tarpaulin , whilst he cowered close to the floor of the ledge , looking only through the screen of tall grasses .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 8]: They kindled a fire near the well .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 31]: Soon its ruddy glare lit up the dark rock with fantastic flickerings , and drew scintillations from the weapons and ornaments of the hideously picturesque horde gathered in its vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 43]: They spoke a language of hard vowels and nasal resonance , and ate what he judged to be dry fish , millets , and strips of tough preserved meat , which they cooked on small iron skewers stuck among the glowing embers .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 19]: His heart sank as he counted sixty-one , all told , assembled within forty yards of the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 13]: Probably several others were guarding the boats or prowling about the island .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 35]: Indeed , events proved that more than eighty men had come ashore in three large sampans , roomy and fleet craft , well fitted for piratical excursions up river estuaries or along a coast .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 20]: They were mostly bare-legged rascals , wearing Malay hats , loose jackets reaching to the knee , and sandals .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 8]: One man differed essentially from the others .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 28]: He was habited in the conventional attire of an Indian Mahommedan , and his skin was brown , whilst the swarthy Dyaks were yellow beneath the dirt .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 30]: Jenks thought , from the manner in which his turban was tied , that he must be a Punjabi Mussulman -- very likely an escaped convict from the Andamans .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 12]: The most careful scrutiny did not reveal any arms of precision .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 22]: They all carried muzzle-loaders , either antiquated flintlocks , or guns sufficiently modern to be fitted with nipples for percussion caps .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 30]: Each Dyak , of course , sported a parang and dagger-like kriss ; a few bore spears , and about a dozen shouldered a long straight piece of bamboo .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 14]: The nature of this implement the sailor could not determine at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 40]: When the knowledge did come , it came so rapidly that he was saved from many earlier hours of abiding ; dread , for one of those innocuous-looking weapons was fraught with more quiet deadliness than a Gatling gun .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 12]: In the neighborhood of the fire an animated discussion took place .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 25]: Though it was easy to see that the chief was all-paramount , his fellow-tribesmen exercised a democratic right of free speech and outspoken opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 12]: Flashing eyes and expressive hands were turned towards cave and hut .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 29]: Once , when the debate grew warm , the chief snatched up a burning branch and held it over the blackened embers of the fire extinguished by Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 23]: He seemed to draw some definite conclusion from an examination of the charcoal , and the argument thenceforth proceeded with less emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 10]: Whatever it was that he said evidently carried conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 21]: Iris , nestling close to the sailor , whispered -- `` Do you know what he has found out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 25]: `` I can only guess that he can tell by the appearance of the burnt wood how long it is since it was extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 7]: Clearly they agree with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 10]: `` Then they know we are still here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 10]: `` Either here or gone within a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 16]: In any case they will make a thorough search of the island at daybreak . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 8]: `` Will it be dawn soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 5]: Are you tired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 10]: `` A little cramped -- that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 15]: `` Do n't think I am foolish -- can you manage to sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 3]: `` Sleep !
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: With those men so near ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 10]: We do not know how long they will remain .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 7]: We must keep up our strength .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 14]: Sleep , next to food and drink , is a prime necessity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 37]: `` If it will please you , I will try , '' she said , with such sweet readiness to obey his slightest wish that the wonder is he did not kiss her then and there .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 10]: By previous instruction she knew exactly what to do .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 17]: She crept quietly back until well ensconced in the niche widened and hollowed for her accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 27]: There , so secluded was she from the outer world of horror and peril , that the coarse voices beneath only reached her in a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 47]: Pulling one end of the tarpaulin over her , she stretched her weary limbs on a litter of twigs and leaves , commended herself and the man she loved to God 's keeping , and , wonderful though it may seem , was soon slumbering peacefully .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 27]: The statement may sound passing strange to civilized ears , accustomed only to the routine of daily life and not inured to danger and wild surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 60]: But the soldier who has snatched a hasty doze in the trenches , the sailor who has heard a fierce gale buffeting the walls of his frail ark , can appreciate the reason why Iris , weary and surfeited with excitement , would have slept were she certain that the next sunrise would mark her last hour on earth .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 11]: Jenks , too , composed himself for a brief rest .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 31]: He felt assured that there was not the remotest chance of their lofty perch being found out before daybreak , and the first faint streaks of dawn would awaken him .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 29]: These two , remote , abandoned , hopelessly environed by a savage enemy , closed their eyes contentedly and awaited that which the coming day should bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 56]: When the morning breeze swept over the ocean and the stars were beginning to pale before the pink glory flung broadcast through the sky by the yet invisible sun , the sailor was aroused by the quiet fluttering of a bird about to settle on the rock , but startled by the sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 26]: His faculties were at once on the alert , though he little realized the danger betokened by the bird 's rapid dart into the void .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 16]: Turning first to peer at Iris , he satisfied himself that she was still asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 18]: Her lips were slightly parted in a smile ; she might be dreaming of summer and England .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 18]: He noiselessly wormed his way to the verge of the rock and looked down through the grass-roots .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: The Dyaks were already stirring .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 34]: Some were replenishing the fire , others were drawing water , cooking , eating , smoking long thin-stemmed pipes with absurdly small bowls , or oiling their limbs and weapons with impartial energy .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 47]: The chief yet lay stretched on the sand , but , when the first beams of the sun gilded the waters , a man stooped over the prostrate form and said something that caused the sleeper to rise stiffly , supporting himself on his uninjured arm .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 10]: They at once went off together towards Europa Point .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 11]: `` They have found the boat , '' thought Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 14]: `` Well , they are welcome to all the information it affords . ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 5]: The pair soon returned .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 12]: Another Dyak advanced to exhibit one of Jenks 's spring-gun attachments .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 8]: The savages had a sense of humor .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 13]: Several laughed heartily when the cause of their overnight alarms was revealed .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 10]: The chief alone preserved a gloomy and saturnine expression .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 12]: He gave some order at which they all hung back sheepishly .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 21]: Cursing them in choice Malay , the chief seized a thick faggot and strode in the direction of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 38]: Goaded into activity by his truculent demeanor , some followed him , and Jenks -- unable to see , but listening anxiously -- knew that they were tearing the _ cheval de frise _ from its supports .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 10]: Nevertheless none of the working party entered the excavation .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 10]: They feared the parched bones that shone by night .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 5]: `` Poor J.S. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 4]: murmured the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 23]: `` If his spirit still lingers near the scene of his murder he will thank me for dragging him into the fray .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 12]: He fought them living and he can scare them dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 26]: As he had not been able to complete the communicating shaft it was not now of vital importance should the Dyaks penetrate to the interior .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 28]: Yet he thanked the good luck that had showered such a heap of rubbish over the spot containing his chief stores and covering the vein of gold .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 36]: Wild as these fellows were , they well knew the value of the precious metal , and if by chance they lighted upon such a well-defined lode they might not quit the island for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 17]: At last , on a command from the chief , the Dyaks scattered in various directions .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 23]: Some turned towards Europa Point , but the majority went to the east along Turtle Beach or by way of the lagoon .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 5]: Prospect Park was deserted .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 12]: They were scouring both sections of the island in full force .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 11]: The quiet watcher on the ledge took no needless risks .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 21]: Though it was impossible to believe any stratagem had been planned for his special benefit an accident might betray him .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 30]: With the utmost circumspection he rose on all fours and with comprehensive glance examined trees , plateau , and both strips of beach for signs of a lurking foe .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 6]: He need have no fear .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 23]: Of all places in the island the Dyaks least imagined that their quarry had lain all night within earshot of their encampment .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 33]: At this hour , when the day had finally conquered the night , and the placid sea offered a turquoise path to the infinite , the scene was restful , gently bewitching .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 40]: He knew that , away there to the north , P. and O. steamers , Messageries Maritimes , and North German Lloyd liners were steadily churning the blue depths _ en route _ to Japan or the Straits Settlements .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 35]: They carried hundreds of European passengers , men and women , even little children , who were far removed from the knowledge that tragedies such as this Dyak horror lay almost in their path .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 10]: People in London were just going to the theater .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 24]: He recalled the familiar jingle of the hansoms scampering along Piccadilly , the more stately pace of the private carriages crossing the Park .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 58]: Was it possible that in the world of today -- the world of telegraphs and express trains , of the newspaper and the motor car -- two inoffensive human beings could be done to death so shamefully and openly as would be the fate of Iris and himself if they fell into the hands of these savages !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 6]: It was inconceivable , intolerable !
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 5]: But it was true !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 50]: And then , by an odd trick of memory , his mind reverted , not to the Yorkshire manor he learnt to love as a boy , but to a little French inland town where he once passed a summer holiday intent on improving his knowledge of the language .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 17]: Interior France is even more remote , more secluded , more provincial , than agricultural England .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 9]: There no breath of the outer world intrudes .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 17]: All is laborious , circumspect , a trifle poverty-stricken , but beautified by an Arcadian simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 54]: Yet one memorable day , when walking by the banks of a river , he came upon three men dragging from out a pool the water-soaked body of a young girl into whose fair forehead the blunt knob often seen on the back of an old-fashioned axe had been driven with cruel force .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 18]: So , even in that tiny old-world hamlet , murder and lust could stalk hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 3]: He shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 9]: Why did such a hateful vision trouble him ?
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 17]: Resolutely banning the raven-winged specter , he slid back down the ledge and gently wakened Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 12]: She sat up instantly and gazed at him with wondering eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 17]: Fearful lest she should forget her surroundings , he placed a warning finger on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 17]: `` Oh , '' she said in a whisper , `` are they still here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 23]: He told her what had happened , and suggested that they should have something to eat whilst the coast was clear beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 38]: She needed no second bidding , for the long vigil of the previous night had made her very hungry , and the two breakfasted right royally on biscuit , cold fowl , ham , and good water .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 49]: In this , the inner section of their refuge , they could be seen only by a bird or by a man standing on the distant rocky shelf that formed the southern extremity of the opposite cliff , and the sailor kept a close lookout in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 22]: Iris was about to throw the remains of the feast into an empty oil-tin provided for refuse when Jenks restrained her .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 9]: `` No , '' he said , smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 10]: `` Scraps should be the first course next time .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 10]: We must not waste an atom of food . ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 7]: `` How thoughtless of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 13]: `` Please tell me you think they will go away today . ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 14]: But the sailor flung himself flat on the ledge and grasped a Lee-Metford .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 12]: `` Be still , on your life , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 6]: `` Squeeze into your corner .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 10]: There is a Dyak on the opposite cliff . ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 29]: True enough , a man had climbed to that unhappily placed rocky table , and was shouting something to a confrère high on the cliff over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 18]: As yet he had not seen them , nor even noticed the place where they were concealed .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 27]: The sailor imagined , from the Dyak 's gestures , that he was communicating the uselessness of further search on the western part of the island .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 13]: When the conversation ceased , he hoped the loud-voiced savage would descend .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 17]: The scout looked into the valley , at the well , the house , the cave .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 8]: Still he did not see the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 42]: At that unlucky moment three birds , driven from the trees on the crest by the passage of the Dyaks , flew down the face of the cliff and began a circling quest for some safe perch on which to alight .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 25]: Jenks swore with an emphasis not the less earnest because it was mute , and took steady aim at the Dyak 's left breast .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: The birds fluttered about in ever smaller circles .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 14]: Then one of them dropped easily on to the lip of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 24]: Instantly his bright eyes encountered those of the man , and he darted off with a scream that brought his mates after him .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 27]: The Dyak evidently noted the behavior of the birds -- his only lore was the reading of such signs -- and gazed intently at the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 11]: Jenks he could not distinguish behind the screen of grass .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 27]: He might perhaps see some portion of the tarpaulin covering the stores , but at the distance it must resemble a weather-beaten segment of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 5]: Yet something puzzled him .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 14]: After a steady scrutiny he turned and yelled to others on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 6]: The crucial moment had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 19]: Jenks pressed the trigger , and the Dyak hurtled through the air , falling headlong out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 19]: The sound of this , the first shot of real warfare , awoke Rainbow Island into tremendous activity .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 21]: The winged life of the place filled the air with raucous cries , whilst shouting Dyaks scurried in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 6]: Several came into the valley .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: Those nearest the fallen man picked him up and carried him to the well .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 57]: He was quite dead , and , although amidst his other injuries they soon found the bullet wound , they evidently did not know whence the shot came , for those to whom he shouted had no inkling of his motive , and the slight haze from the rifle was instantly swept away by the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 21]: Iris could hear the turmoil beneath , and she tremulously asked -- `` Are they going to attack us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 10]: `` Not yet , '' was the reassuring answer .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 16]: `` I killed the fellow who saw us before he could tell the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 35]: It was a bold risk , and he had taken it , though , now the Dyaks knew for certain their prey had not escaped , there was no prospect of their speedy departure .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 8]: Nevertheless the position was not utterly hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 16]: None of the enemy could tell how or by whom their companion had been shot .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 49]: Many among the excited horde jabbering beneath actually looked at the cliff over and over again , yet failed to note the potentialities of the ledge , with its few tufts of grass growing where seeds had apparently been blown by the wind or dropped by passing birds .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 23]: Jenks understood , of course , that the real danger would arise when they visited the scene of their comrade 's disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 15]: Even then the wavering balance of chance might cast the issue in his favor .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 19]: He could only wait , with ready rifle , with the light of battle lowering in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 20]: Of one thing at least he was certain -- before they conquered him he would levy a terrible toll .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 6]: He glanced back at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 10]: Her face was pale beneath its mask of sunbrown .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 20]: She was bent over her Bible , and Jenks did not know that she was reading the 91st Psalm .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 30]: Her lips murmured -- `` I will say unto the Lord , He is my refuge and my fortress ; my God , in Him will I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 20]: The chief was listening intently to the story of the Dyak who saw the dead man totter and fall .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 6]: He gave some quick order .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 25]: Followed by a score or more of his men he walked rapidly to the foot of the cliff where they found the lifeless body .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 26]: And Iris read -- `` Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night ; nor for the arrow that flieth by day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 9]: Jenks stole one more hasty glance at her .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 17]: The chief and the greater number of his followers were out of sight behind the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 12]: Some of them must now be climbing to that fatal ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 5]: Was this the end ?
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 19]: Yet the girl , unconscious of the doom impending , kept her eyes steadfastly fixed on the book .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 19]: `` For He shall give His angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 49]: `` They shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone ... `` He shall call upon me , and I will answer him : I will be with him in trouble : I will deliver him and honour him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 10]: Iris did not apply the consoling words to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 32]: She closed the book and bent forward sufficiently in her sheltering niche to permit her to gaze with wistful tenderness upon the man whom she hoped to see delivered and honored .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 10]: She knew he would dare all for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 7]: She could only pray and hope .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 14]: After reading those inspired verses she placed implicit trust in the promise made .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 15]: For He was good : His was the mercy that `` endureth forever . ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 37]: Enemies encompassed them with words of hatred -- fought against them without a cause -- but there was One who should `` judge among the heathen '' and `` fill the places with dead bodies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 11]: Suddenly a clamor of discordant yells fell upon her ears .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 6]: Jenks rose to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 13]: The Dyaks had discovered their refuge and were about to open fire .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 13]: He offered them a target lest perchance Iris were not thoroughly screened .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 8]: `` Keep close , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 6]: `` They have found us .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 8]: Lead will be flying around soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 12]: She flinched back into the crevice ; the sailor fell prone .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 21]: Four bullets spat into the ledge , of which three pierced the tarpaulin and one flattened itself against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: Then Jenks took up the tale .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 32]: So curiously constituted was this man , that although he ruthlessly shot the savage who first spied out their retreat , he was swayed only by the dictates of stern necessity .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 12]: There was a feeble chance that further bloodshed might be averted .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 5]: That chance had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 12]: The enemy must start the dreadful game about to be played .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 10]: They had thrown the gage and he answered them .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 17]: Four times did the Lee-Metford carry death , unseen , almost unfelt , across the valley .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 25]: Ere the fourth Dyak collapsed limply where he stood , others were there , firing at the little puff of smoke above the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 21]: They got in a few shots , most of which sprayed at various angles off the face of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 7]: But they waited for no more .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 29]: When the lever of the Lee-Metford was shoved home for the fifth time the opposing crest was bare of all opponents save two , and they lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 24]: The fate of the flanking detachment was either unperceived or unheeded by the Dyaks left in the vicinity of the house and well .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 37]: Astounded by the firing that burst forth in mid-air , Jenks had cleared the dangerous rock before they realized that here , above their heads , were the white man and the maid whom they sought .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 22]: With stupid zeal they blazed away furiously , only succeeding in showering fragments of splintered stone into the Eagle 's Nest .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 5]: And the sailor smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 22]: He quietly picked up an old coat , rolled it into a ball and pushed it into sight amidst the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 16]: Then he squirmed round on his stomach and took up a position ten feet away .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 31]: Of course those who still carried loaded guns discharged them at the bundle of rags , whereupon Jenks thrust his rifle beyond the edge of the rock and leaned over .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 13]: Three Dyaks fell before the remainder made up their minds to run .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 19]: Once convinced , however , that running was good for their health , they moved with much celerity .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 15]: The remaining cartridges in the magazine slackened the pace of two of their number .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 9]: Jenks dropped the empty weapon and seized another .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 14]: He stood up now and sent a quick reminder after the rearmost pirate .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 29]: The others had disappeared towards the locality where their leader and his diminished troupe were gathered , not daring to again come within range of the whistling Dum-dums .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 22]: The sailor , holding his rifle as though pheasant-shooting , bent forward and sought a belated opponent , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 14]: In military phrase , the _ terrain _ was clear of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 42]: There was no sound save the wailing of birds , the soft sough of the sea , and the yelling of the three wounded men in the house , who knew not what terrors threatened , and vainly bawled for succor .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 7]: Again Jenks could look at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 5]: Her face was bleeding .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 5]: The sight maddened him .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 9]: he groaned , `` are you wounded ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 6]: She smiled bravely at him .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 9]: `` It is nothing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 13]: `` A mere splash from the rock which cut my forehead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 7]: He dared not go to her .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 26]: He could only hope that it was no worse , so he turned to examine the valley once more for vestige of a living foe .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 37]: CHAPTER XII A TRUCE Though his eyes , like live coals , glowered with sullen fire at the strip of sand and the rocks in front , his troubled brain paid perfunctory heed to his task .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 46]: The stern sense of duty , the ingrained force of long years of military discipline and soldierly thought , compelled him to keep watch and ward over his fortress , but he could not help asking himself what would happen if Iris were seriously wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 37]: There was one enemy more potent than these skulking Dyaks , a foe more irresistible in his might , more pitiless in his strength , whose assaults would tax to the utmost their powers of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 26]: In another hour the sun would be high in the heavens , pouring his ardent rays upon them and drying the blood in their veins .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 45]: Hitherto , the active life of the island , the shade of trees , hut or cave , the power of unrestricted movement and the possession of water in any desired quantity , robbed the tropical heat of the day of its chief terrors .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 5]: Now all was changed .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 35]: Instead of working amidst grateful foliage , they were bound to the brown rock , which soon would glow with radiated energy and give off scorching gusts like unto the opening of a furnace-door .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 7]: This he had foreseen all along .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 20]: The tarpaulin would yield them some degree of uneasy protection , and they both were in perfect physical condition .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 7]: But -- if Iris were wounded !
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 10]: If the extra strain brought fever in its wake !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 41]: That way he saw nothing but blank despair , to be ended , for her , by delirium and merciful death , for him by a Berserk rush among the Dyaks , and one last mad fight against overwhelming numbers .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 27]: Then the girl 's voice reached him , self-reliant , almost cheerful -- `` You will be glad to hear that the cut has stopped bleeding .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 7]: It is only a scratch . ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 12]: So a kindly Providence had spared them yet a little while .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 14]: The cloud passed from his mind , the gathering mist from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 22]: In that instant he thought he detected a slight rustling among the trees where the cliff shelved up from the house .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 21]: Standing as he was on the edge of the rock , this was a point he could not guard against .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 32]: When her welcome assurance recalled his scattered senses , he stepped back to speak to her , and in the same instant a couple of bullets crashed against the rock overhead .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 14]: Iris had unwittingly saved him from a serious , perhaps fatal , wound .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 17]: He sprang to the extreme right of the ledge and boldly looked into the trees beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 14]: Two Dyaks were there , belated wanderers cut off from the main body .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 17]: They dived headlong into the undergrowth for safety , but one of them was too late .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 24]: The Lee-Metford reached him , and its reverberating concussion , tossed back and forth by the echoing rocks , drowned his parting scream .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 14]: In the plenitude of restored vigor the sailor waited for no counter demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 12]: He turned and crouchingly approached the southern end of his parapet .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 35]: Through his screen of grass he could discern the long black hair and yellow face of a man who lay on the sand and twisted his head around the base of the further cliff .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 20]: The distance , oft measured , was ninety yards , the target practically a six-inch bull 's - eye .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 15]: Jenks took careful aim , fired , and a whiff of sand flew up .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 18]: Perhaps he had used too fine a sight and ploughed a furrow beneath the Dyak 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 23]: He only heard a faint yell , but the enterprising head vanished and there were no more volunteers for that particular service .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 23]: He was still peering at the place when a cry of unmitigated anguish came from Iris -- `` Oh , come quick !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 3]: Our water !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 6]: The casks have burst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 51]: It was not until Jenks had torn the tarpaulin from off their stores , and he was wildly striving with both hands to scoop up some precious drops collected in the small hollows of the ledge , that he realized the full magnitude of the disaster which had befallen them .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 22]: During the first rapid exchange of fire , before the enemy vacated the cliff , several bullets had pierced the tarpaulin .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 21]: By a stroke of exceeding bad fortune two of them had struck each of the water-barrels and started the staves .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 28]: The contents quietly ebbed away beneath the broad sheet , and flowing inwards by reason of the sharp slope of the ledge , percolated through the fault .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 23]: Iris and he , notwithstanding their frenzied efforts , were not able to save more than a pint of gritty discolored fluid .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 49]: The rest , infinitely more valuable to them than all the diamonds of De Beers , was now oozing through the natural channel cut by centuries of storm , dripping upon the headless skeleton in the cave , soaking down to the very heart of their buried treasure .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 12]: Jenks was so paralyzed by this catastrophe that Iris became alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 10]: As yet she did not grasp its awful significance .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 35]: That he , her hero , so brave , so confident in the face of many dangers , should betray such sense of irredeemable loss , frightened her much more than the incident itself .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 4]: Her lips whitened .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 5]: Her words become incoherent .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 8]: `` Tell me , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 8]: `` I can bear anything but silence .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 7]: Tell me , I implore you .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 6]: Is it so bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 8]: The sight of her distress sobered him .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 24]: He ground his teeth together as a man does who submits to a painful operation and resolves not to flinch beneath the knife .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 21]: `` It is very bad , '' he said ; `` not quite the end , but near it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 13]: `` The end , '' she bravely answered , `` is death !
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 6]: We are living and uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 5]: You must fight on .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 11]: If the Lord wills it we shall not die . ''
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 14]: He looked in her blue eyes and saw there the light of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 13]: `` God bless you , dear girl , '' he murmured brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 20]: `` You would cheer any man through the Valley of the Shadow , were he Christian or Faint-heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 8]: Her glance did not droop before his .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 10]: In such moments heart speaks to heart without concealment .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 12]: `` We still have a little water , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 7]: `` Fortunately we are not thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 12]: You have not forgotten our supply of champagne and brandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 11]: There was a species of mad humor in the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 12]: Oh for another miracle that should change the wine into water !
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 20]: He could only fall in with her unreflective mood and leave the dreadful truth to its own evil time .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 16]: In their little nook the power of the sun had not yet made itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 9]: By ordinary computation it was about nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 8]: Long before noon they would be grilling .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 23]: Throughout the next few hours they must suffer the torture of Dives with one meager pint of water to share between them .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 13]: Of course the wine and spirit must be shunned like a pestilence .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 16]: To touch either under such conditions would be courting heat , apoplexy , and death .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 4]: And next day !
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 21]: He tightened his jaws before he answered -- `` We will console ourselves with a bottle of champagne for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 17]: Meanwhile , I hear our friends shouting to those left on this side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 11]: I must take an active interest in the conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 15]: He grasped a rifle and lay down on the ledge , already gratefully warm .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 11]: There was a good deal of sustained shouting going on .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 31]: Jenks thought he recognized the chief 's voice , giving instructions to those who had come from Smugglers ' Cove and were now standing on the beach near the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 12]: `` I wonder if he is hungry , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 12]: `` If so , I will interfere with the commissariat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 6]: Iris peeped forth at him .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 5]: `` Mr. Jenks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' without turning his head .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 8]: He knew it was an ordinary question .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 7]: `` May I come too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 7]: expose yourself on the ledge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 6]: `` Yes , even that .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 10]: I am so tired of sitting here alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 10]: `` Well , there is no danger at present .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 23]: But they might chance to see you , and you remember what I -- '' `` Yes , I remember quite well .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 13]: If that is all -- '' There was a rustle of garments .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 8]: `` I am very mannish in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 14]: If you promise not to look at me I will join you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 5]: `` I promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 4]: Iris stepped forth .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 22]: She was flushed a little , and , to cover her confusion , may be , she picked up a Lee-Metford .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 17]: `` Now there are two guns , '' she said , as she stood near him .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 27]: He could see through the tail of his eye that a slight but elegantly proportioned young gentleman of the sea-faring profession had suddenly appeared from nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 9]: He was glad she had taken this course .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 13]: It might better the position were the Dyaks to see her thus .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 17]: `` The moment I tell you , you must fall flat , '' he warned her .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 6]: `` No ceremony about it .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 4]: Just flop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 20]: `` I do n't know anything better calculated to make one flop than a bullet , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 13]: Not yet did the tragedy of the broken kegs appeal to her .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 12]: `` Yes , but it achieves its purpose in two ways .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 10]: I want you to adopt the precautionary method . ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: `` Trust me for that .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 4]: Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 18]: The sailor 's rifle went off with an unexpected bang that froze the exclamation on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 13]: Three Dyaks were attempting to run the gauntlet to their beleaguered comrades .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 9]: They carried a jar and two wicker baskets .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: He with the jar fell and broke it .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 16]: The others doubled back like hares , and the first man dragged himself after them .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 6]: Jenks did not fire again .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 10]: Iris watched the wounded wretch crawling along the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 10]: Her eyes grew moist , and she paled somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 24]: When he vanished she looked into the valley and at the opposing ledge ; three men lay dead within twenty yards of her .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 7]: Two others dangled from the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 26]: It took her some time to control her quavering utterance sufficiently to say -- `` I hope I may not have to use a gun .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 28]: I know it can not be helped , but if I were to kill a human being I do not think I would ever rest again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 17]: `` In that case I have indeed murdered sleep today , '' was the unfeeling reply .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 9]: A man must be made of sterner stuff .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 8]: We have a right to defend ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 9]: If need be I will exercise that right .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 11]: Still it is horrid , oh , so horrid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 10]: She could not see the sailor 's grim smile .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 26]: It would materially affect his rest , for the better , were he able to slay every Dyak on the island with a single shot .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: Yet her gentle protest pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 16]: She could not at the same time be callous to human suffering and be Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 9]: But he declined the discussion of such sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 15]: `` You were going to say something when a brief disturbance took place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 13]: I was surprised to find how hot the ledge has become . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 14]: `` You notice it more because you are obliged to remain here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 23]: After a pause -- `` I think I understand now why you were so upset by the loss of our water supply .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 17]: Before the day ends we will be in great straits , enduring agonies from thirst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 13]: `` Let us not meet the devil half-way , '' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 14]: He preferred the unfair retort to a confession which could only foster dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 11]: `` But , please , I am thirsty now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 4]: He moved uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 27]: He was only too conscious of the impish weakness , common to all mankind , which creates a desire out of sheer inability to satisfy it .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 7]: Already his own throat was parched .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 16]: The excitement of the early struggle was in itself enough to engender an acute thirst .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 14]: He thought it best to meet their absolute needs as far as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 10]: `` Bring the tin cup , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 15]: `` Let us take half our store and use the remainder when we eat .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 8]: Try to avoid breathing through your mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 13]: The hot air quickly affects the palate and causes an artificial dryness .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 11]: We can not yet be in real need of water .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 6]: It is largely imagination . ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 6]: Iris needed no second bidding .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 24]: She carefully measured out half a pint of the unsavory fluid -- the dregs of the casks and the scourings of the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: `` I will drink first , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' he interrupted impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 7]: `` Give it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 6]: She pretended to be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 20]: `` As a mere matter of politeness -- '' `` I am sorry , but I must insist . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 9]: She gave him the cup over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 10]: He placed it to his lips and gulped steadily .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 9]: `` There , '' he said , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 7]: `` I was in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 11]: The Dyaks may make another rush at any moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 6]: Iris looked into the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 12]: `` You have taken none at all , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 7]: `` Mr. Jenks , be reasonable !
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 19]: You need it more than I. I d-don ' t want to -- live w-without -- you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 5]: His hands shook somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 13]: It was well there was no call for accurate shooting just then .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 17]: `` I assure you I took all I required , '' he declared with unnecessary vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 15]: `` At least drink your share , to please me , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 11]: `` You wished to humbug me , '' he grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 15]: `` If you will take the first half I will take the second . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 7]: And they settled it that way .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 11]: The few mouthfuls of tepid water gave them new life .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 7]: One sense can deceive the others .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 24]: A man developing all the symptoms of hydrophobia has been cured by the assurance that the dog which bit him was not mad .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 19]: So these two , not yet aflame with drought , banished the arid phantom for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 10]: Nevertheless , by high noon they were suffering again .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 6]: The time passed very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 15]: The sun rose to the zenith and filled earth and air with his ardor .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 33]: It seemed to be a miracle -- now appreciated for the first time in their lives -- that the sea did not dry up , and the leaves wither on the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 13]: The silence , the deathly inactivity of all things , became intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 15]: The girl bravely tried to confine her thoughts to the task of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 38]: She displayed alert watchfulness , an instant readiness to warn her companion of the slightest movement among the trees or by the rocks to the north-west , this being the arc of their periphery assigned to her .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 33]: Looking at a sunlit space from cover , and looking at the same place when sweltering in the direct rays of a tropical sun , are kindred operations strangely diverse in achievement .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 19]: Iris could not reconcile the physical sensitiveness of the hour with the careless hardihood of the preceding days .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 28]: Her eyes ached somewhat , for she had tilted her sou ` wester to the back of her head in the effort to cool her throbbing temples .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 35]: She put up her right hand to shade the too vivid reflection of the glistening sea , and was astounded to find that in a few minutes the back of her hand was scorched .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: A faint sound of distant shouting disturbed her painful reverie .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 19]: `` How is it , '' she asked , `` that we feel the heat so much today ?
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 8]: I have hardly noticed it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 15]: `` For two good reasons -- forced idleness and radiation from this confounded rock .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 14]: Moreover , this is the hottest day we have experienced on the island .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 17]: There is not a breath of air , and the hot weather has just commenced . ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 22]: `` Do n't you think , '' she said , huskily , `` that our position here is quite hopeless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 8]: They were talking to each other sideways .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 14]: The sailor never turned his gaze from the southern end of the valley .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 18]: `` It is no more hopeless now than last night or this morning , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 12]: `` But suppose we are kept here for several days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 9]: `` That was always an unpleasant probability . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 6]: `` We had water then .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 13]: Even with an ample supply it would be difficult to hold out .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 12]: As things are , such a course becomes simply impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: Her despondency pierced his soul .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: A slow agony was consuming her .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 12]: `` It is hard , I admit , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 10]: `` Nevertheless you must bear up until night falls .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 12]: Then we will either obtain water or leave this place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 8]: `` Surely we can do neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 10]: `` We may be compelled to do both . ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 5]: `` But how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 18]: In this , his hour of extremest need , the man was vouchsafed a shred of luck .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 10]: To answer her satisfactorily would have baffled a Talleyrand .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 32]: But before he could frame a feeble pretext for his too sanguine prediction , a sampan appeared , eight hundred yards from Turtle Beach , and strenuously paddled by three men .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 9]: The vague hallooing they had heard was explained .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 18]: The Dyaks , though to the manner born , were weary of sun-scorched rocks and salt water .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 19]: The boat was coming in response to their signals , and the sight inspired Jenks with fresh hope .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 54]: Like a lightning flash came the reflection that if he could keep them away from the well and destroy the sampan now hastening to their assistance , perhaps conveying the bulk of their stores , they would soon tire of slaking their thirst , on the few pitcher-plants growing on the north shore .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 15]: `` Come quick , '' he shouted , adjusting the backsight of a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 18]: `` Lie down and aim at the front of that boat , a little short if anything .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 13]: It does n't matter if the bullets strike the sea first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 19]: He placed the weapon in readiness for her and commenced operations himself before Iris could reach his side .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 13]: Soon both rifles were pitching twenty shots a minute at the sampan .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 12]: The result of their long-range practice was not long in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 14]: The Dyaks danced from seat to seat in a state of wild excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 6]: One man was hurled overboard .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 21]: Then the craft lurched seaward in the strong current , and Jenks told Iris to leave the rest to him .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 35]: Before he could empty a second magazine a fortunate bullet ripped a plank out and the sampan filled and went down , amidst a shrill yell of execration from the back of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 17]: The two Dyaks yet living endeavored to swim ashore , half a mile through shark-invested reefs .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 9]: The sailor did not even trouble about them .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 15]: After a few frantic struggles each doomed wretch flung up his arms and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 15]: In the clear atmosphere the on-lookers could see black fins cutting the pellucid sea .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 13]: This exciting episode dispelled the gathering mists from the girl 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 8]: Her eyes danced and she breathed hard .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: Yet something worried her .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 20]: `` I hope I did n't hit the man who fell out of the boat , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 18]: `` Oh , '' came the prompt assurance , `` I took deliberate aim at that chap .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 8]: He was a most persistent scoundrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 4]: Iris was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 22]: Jenks thought it better to lie than to tell the truth , for the bald facts hardly bore out his assertion .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 32]: Judging from the manner of the Dyak 's involuntary plunge he had been hit by a ricochet bullet , whilst the sailor 's efforts were wholly confined to sinking the sampan .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 6]: However , let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 10]: Bullet or shark , the end was the same .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 34]: They were quieting down -- the thirst fiend was again slowly salting their veins -- when something of a dirty white color fluttered into sight from behind the base of the opposite cliff .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 11]: It was rapidly withdrawn , to reappear after an interval .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 13]: Now it was held more steadily and a brown arm became visible .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 13]: As Jenks did not fire , a turbaned head popped into sight .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 5]: It was the Mahommedan .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 9]: `` No shoot it , '' he roared .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 7]: `` Me English speak it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 8]: `` Do n't you speak Hindustani ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 9]: shouted Jenks in Urdu of the Higher Proficiency .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 6]: `` Hañ , sahib ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 8]: -LSB- Footnote : Yes , sir . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 5]: was the joyful response .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 15]: `` Will your honor permit his servant to come and talk with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 9]: `` Yes , if you come unarmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 10]: `` And the chief , too , sahib ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 6]: `` Yes , but listen !
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 13]: On the first sign of treachery I shoot both of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 8]: `` We will keep faith , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 10]: May kites pick our bones if we fail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 13]: Then there stepped into full view the renegade Mussulman and his leader .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 11]: They carried no guns ; the chief wore his kriss .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 15]: -LSB- Illustration : THE TWO HALTED SOME TEN PACES IN FRONT OF THE CAVERN .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 8]: AND THE BELLIGERENTS SURVEYED EACH OTHER . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 10]: `` Tell him to leave that dagger behind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 5]: cried the sailor imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 18]: As the enemy demanded a parley he resolved to adopt the conqueror 's tone from the outset .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 18]: The chief obeyed with a scowl , and the two advanced to the foot of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 12]: `` Stand close to me , '' said Jenks to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 18]: `` Let them see you plainly , but pull your hat well down over your eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 6]: She silently followed his instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 30]: Now that the very crisis of their fate had arrived she was nervous , shaken , conscious only of a desire to sink on her knees , and pray .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 14]: One or two curious heads were craned round the corner of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 3]: cried Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 16]: `` If those men do not instantly go away I will fire at them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 18]: The Indian translated this order and the chief vociferated some clanging syllables which had the desired effect .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 19]: The two halted some ten paces in front of the cavern , and the belligerents surveyed each other .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 12]: It was a fascinating spectacle , this drama in real life .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 57]: The yellow-faced Dyak , gaudily attired in a crimson jacket and sky-blue pantaloons of Chinese silk -- a man with the _ beauté du diable _ , young , and powerfully built -- and the brown-skinned white-clothed Mahommedan , bony , tall , and grey with hardship , looked up at the occupants of the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 34]: Iris , slim and boyish in her male garments , was dwarfed by the six-foot sailor , but her face was blood-stained , and Jenks wore a six weeks ' stubble of beard .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 26]: Holding their Lee-Metfords with alert ease , with revolvers strapped to their sides , they presented a warlike and imposing tableau in their inaccessible perch .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 13]: In the path of the emissaries lay the bodies of the slain .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 10]: The Dyak leader scowled again as he passed them .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 34]: `` Sahib , '' began the Indian , `` my chief , Taung S'Ali , does not wish to have any more of his men killed in a foolish quarrel about a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 36]: Give her up , he says , and he will either leave you here in peace , or carry you safely to some place where you can find a ship manned by white men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 5]: `` A woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 5]: said Jenks , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: `` That is idle talk !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 6]: What woman is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 6]: This question nonplussed the native .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 15]: `` The woman whom the chief saw half a month back , sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 6]: `` Taung S'Ali was bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 12]: I slew his men so quickly that he saw spirits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: The chief caught his name and broke in with a question .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 39]: A volley of talk between the two was enlivened with expressive gestures by Taung S'Ali , who several times pointed to Iris , and Jenks now anathematized his thoughtless folly in permitting the Dyak to approach so near .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 29]: The Mahommedan , of course , had never seen her , and might have persuaded the other that in truth there were two men only on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 8]: His fears were only too well founded .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 51]: The Mussulman salaamed respectfully and said -- `` Protector of the poor , I can not gainsay your word , but Taung S'Ali says that the maid stands by your side , and is none the less the woman he seeks in that she wears a man 's clothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 17]: `` He has sharp eyes , but his brain is addled , '' retorted the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 17]: `` Why does he come here to seek a woman who is not of his race ?
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 38]: Not only has he brought death to his people and narrowly escaped it himself , but he must know that any violence offered to us will mean the extermination of his whole tribe by an English warship .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 14]: Tell him to take away his boats and never visit this isle again .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 18]: Perhaps I will then forget his treacherous attempt to murder us whilst we slept last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 24]: The chief glared back defiantly , whilst the Mahommedan said -- `` Sahib , it is beet not to anger him too much .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 9]: He says he means to have the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 12]: He saw her beauty that day and she inflamed his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 16]: She has cost him many lives , but she is worth a Sultan 's ransom .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 6]: He cares not for warships .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 10]: They can not reach his village in the hills .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 29]: By the tomb of Nizam-ud-din , sahib , he will not harm you if you give her up , but if you refuse he will kill you both .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 20]: And what is one woman more or less in the world that she should cause strife and blood-letting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 31]: The sailor knew the Eastern character too well not to understand the man 's amazement that he should be so solicitous about the fate of one of the weaker sex .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 26]: It was seemingly useless to offer terms , yet the native was clearly so anxious for an amicable settlement that he caught at a straw .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 7]: `` You come from Delhi ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 10]: `` Honored one , you have great wisdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 17]: `` None but a Delhi man swears by the tomb on the road to the Kutub .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 8]: You have escaped from the Andamans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 13]: `` Sahib , I did but slay a man in self-defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 12]: `` Whatever the cause , you can never again see India .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 35]: Nevertheless , you would give many years of your life to mix once more with the bazaar-folk in the Chandni Chowk , and sit at night on a charpoy near the Lahore Gate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 8]: The brown skin assumed a sallow tinge .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 10]: `` That is good speaking , '' he gurgled .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 10]: `` Then help me and my friend to escape .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 8]: Compel your chief to leave the island .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 3]: Kill him !
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 4]: Plot against him !
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 10]: I will promise you freedom and plenty of rupees .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 19]: Do this , and I swear to you I will come in a ship and take you away .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 7]: The miss-sahib 's father is powerful .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 9]: He has great influence with the Sirkar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 9]: -LSB- Footnote : The Government of India . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 17]: Taung S'Ali was evidently bewildered and annoyed by this passionate appeal which he did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 17]: He demanded an explanation , and the ready-witted native was obliged to invent some plausible excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 20]: Yet when he raised his face to Jenks there was the look of a hunted animal in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 13]: `` Sahib , '' he said , endeavoring to conceal his agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 7]: `` I am one among many .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 11]: A word from me and they would cut my throat .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 31]: If I were with you there on the rock I would die with you , for I was in the Kumaon Rissala -LSB- Footnote : A native cavalry regiment . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 6]: when the trouble befell me .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 13]: It is of no avail to bargain with a tiger , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 10]: I suppose you will not give up the miss-sahib .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 6]: Pretend to argue with me .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 9]: I will help in any way possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 12]: Jenks 's heart bounded when this unlooked-for offer reached his ears .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 20]: The unfortunate Mahommedan was evidently eager to get away from the piratical gang into whose power he had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 14]: But the chief was impatient , if not suspicious of these long speeches .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 28]: Angrily holding forth a Lee-Metford the sailor shouted -- `` Tell Taung S'Ali that I will slay him and all his men ere tomorrow 's sun rises .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 11]: He knows something of my power , but not all .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 17]: Tonight , at the twelfth hour , you will find a rope hanging from the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 7]: Tie thereto a vessel of water .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 5]: Fail not in this .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 7]: I will not forget your services .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: I am Anstruther Sahib , of the Belgaum Rissala . ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 16]: The native translated his words into a fierce defiance of Taung S'Ali and his Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 12]: The chief glanced at Jenks and Iris with an ominous smile .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 4]: He muttered something .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 5]: `` Then , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 8]: There is nothing more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 8]: Beware of the trees on your right .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 13]: They can send silent death even to the place where you stand .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 17]: And I will not fail you tonight , on my life , '' cried the interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 5]: `` I believe you .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 2]: Go !
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 26]: But inform your chief that once you have disappeared round the rock whence you came I will talk to him only with a rifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 11]: Taung S'Ali seemed to comprehend the Englishman 's emphatic motions .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 24]: Waving his hand defiantly , the Dyak turned , and , with one parting glance of mute assurance , the Indian followed him .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 10]: And now there came to Jenks a great temptation .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 13]: Iris touched his arm and whispered -- `` What have you decided ?
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 14]: I did not dare to speak lest he should hear my voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 30]: She was sure the Dyak could not penetrate her disguise , though she feared from the manner in which the conference broke up that it had not been satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: Jenks did not answer her .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 23]: He knew that if he killed Taung S'Ali his men would be so dispirited that when the night came they would fly .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 25]: There was so much at stake -- Iris , wealth , love , happiness , life itself -- all depended on his plighted word .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 39]: Yet his savage enemy , a slayer of women , a human vampire soiled with every conceivable crime , was stalking back to safety with a certain dignified strut , calmly trusting to the white man 's bond .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 6]: Oh , it was cruel !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 17]: The ordeal of that ghastly moment was more trying than all that he had hitherto experienced .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 33]: He gave a choking sob of relief when the silken-clad scoundrel passed out of sight without even deigning to give another glance at the ledge or at those who silently watched him .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 17]: Iris could not guess the nature of the mortal struggle raging in the sailor 's soul .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 15]: `` Tell me , '' she repeated , `` what have you done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 23]: `` Kept faith with that swaggering ruffian , '' he said , with an odd feeling of thankfulness that he spoke truly .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 8]: Have you made him any promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 17]: `` Unhappily I permitted him to come here , so I had to let him go .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 6]: He recognized you instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 5]: This surprised her greatly .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 5]: `` Are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 38]: I saw him pointing at me , but he seemed to be in such a bad temper that I imagined that he was angry with you for exchanging a prepossessing young lady for an ill-favored youth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 7]: Jenks with difficulty suppressed a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 11]: Her words for an instant had the old piquant flavor .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 18]: Keeping a close watch on the sheltering promontory , he told her all that had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 13]: Iris became very downcast when she grasped the exact state of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 16]: She was almost certain when the Dyaks proposed a parley that reasonable terms would result .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 18]: It horrified her beyond measure to find that she was the rock on which negotiations were wrecked .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 5]: Hope died within her .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 9]: The bitterness of death was in her breast .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 13]: `` What an unlucky influence I have had on your existence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 16]: `` If it were not for me this trouble at least would be spared you .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: Because I am here you are condemned .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 24]: Again , because I stopped you from shooting that wretched chief and his companions they are now demanding your life as a forfeit .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 6]: It is all my fault .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 7]: I can not bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 8]: She was on the verge of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 9]: The strain had become too great for her .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 40]: After indulging in a wild dream of freedom , to be told that they must again endure the irksome confinement , the active suffering , the slow horrors of a siege in that rocky prison , almost distracted her .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 10]: Jenks was very stern and curt in his reply .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 15]: `` We must make the best of a bad business , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 26]: `` If we are in a tight place the Dyaks are not much better off , and eighteen of their number are dead or wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 18]: You forget , too , that Providence has sent us a most useful ally in the Mahommedan .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 17]: When all is said and done , things might be far worse than they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 30]: Never before had his tone been so cold , his manner so abrupt , not even in the old days when he purposely endeavored to make her dislike him .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 11]: She walked along the ledge and timidly bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 5]: `` Forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 24]: she whispered ; `` I did forget for the moment , not only the goodness of Providence , but also your self-sacrificing devotion .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 27]: I am only a woman , and I do n't want to die yet , but I will not live unless you too are saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 13]: Once already that day she had expressed this thought in other words .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 9]: Was some shadowy design flitting through her brain ?
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 17]: Suppose they were faced with the alternatives of dying from thirst or yielding to the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 6]: Was there another way out ?
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 10]: Jenks shivered , though the rock was grilling him .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 10]: He must divert her mind from this dreadful brooding .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 24]: `` The fact is , '' he said with a feeble attempt at cheerfulness , `` we are both hungry and consequently grumpy .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 7]: Now , suppose you prepare lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 13]: We will feel ever so much better after we have eaten . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 22]: The girl choked back her emotion , and sadly essayed the task of providing a meal which was hateful to her .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 26]: In doing so she saw her Bible , lying where she had placed it that morning , the leaves still open at the 91st Psalm .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 29]: She had indeed forgotten the promise it contained -- `` For He shall give His angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 14]: A few tears fell now and made little furrows down her soiled cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 14]: But they were helpful tears , tears of resignation , not of despair .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 20]: Although the `` destruction that wasteth at noonday '' was trying her sorely she again felt strong and sustained .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 14]: She even smiled on detecting an involuntary effort to clear her stained face .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 28]: She was about to carry a biscuit and some tinned meat to the sailor when a sharp exclamation from him caused her to hasten to his side .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 6]: The Dyaks had broken cover .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 43]: Running in scattered sections across the sands , they were risking such loss as the defenders might be able to inflict upon them during a brief race to the shelter and food to be obtained in the other part of the island .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 9]: Jenks did not fire at the scurrying gang .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 10]: He was waiting for one man , Taung S'Ali .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 28]: But that redoubtable person , having probably suggested this dash for liberty , had fully realized the enviable share of attention he would attract during the passage .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 36]: He therefore discarded his vivid attire , and , by borrowing odd garments , made himself sufficiently like unto the remainder of his crew to deceive the sailor until the rush of men was over .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 18]: Among them ran the Mahommedan , who did not look up the valley but waved his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 14]: When all had quieted down again Jenks understood how he had been fooled .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 34]: He laughed so heartily that Iris , not knowing either the cause of his merriment or the reason of his unlooked-for clemency to the flying foe , feared the sun had affected him .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 13]: He at once quitted the post occupied during so protracted a vigil .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 14]: `` Now , '' he cried , `` we can eat in peace .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 9]: I have stripped the chief of his finery .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 20]: His men can twit him on being forced to shed his gorgeous plumage in order to save his life .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 24]: Anyhow , they will leave us in peace until night falls , so we must make the best of a hot afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 5]: But he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 42]: A greater danger than any yet experienced now threatened them , though Iris , after perusing that wonderful psalm , might have warned him of it had she known the purpose of those long bamboos carried by some of the savages .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 50]: For Taung S'Ali , furious and unrelenting , resolved that if he could not obtain the girl he would slay the pair of them ; and he had terrible weapons in his possession -- weapons that could send `` silent death even to the place where they stood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 7]: CHAPTER XIII REALITY _ V _ .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 32]: ROMANCE -- THE CASE FOR THE DEFENDANT Residents in tropical countries know that the heat is greatest , or certainly least bearable , between two and four o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 42]: At the conclusion of a not very luscious repast , Jenks suggested that they should rig up the tarpaulin in such wise as to gain protection from the sun and yet enable him to cast a watchful eye over the valley .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 15]: Iris helped to raise the great canvas sheet on the supports he had prepared .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 29]: Once shut off from the devouring sun rays , the hot breeze then springing into fitful existence cooled their blistered but perspiring skin and made life somewhat tolerable .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 24]: Still adhering to his policy of combatting the first enervating attacks of thirst , the sailor sanctioned the consumption of the remaining water .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 29]: As a last desperate expedient , to be resorted to only in case of sheer necessity , he uncorked a bottle of champagne and filled the tin cup .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 30]: The sparkling wine , with its volume of creamy foam , looked so tempting that Iris would then and there have risked its potency were she not promptly withheld .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 23]: Jenks explained to her that when the wine became quite flat and insipid they might use it to moisten their parched lips .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 29]: Even so , in their present super-heated state , the liquor was unquestionably dangerous , but he hoped it would not harm them if taken in minute quantities .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: Accustomed now to implicitly accept his advice , she fought and steadily conquered the craving within her .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 21]: Oddly enough , the `` thawing '' of their scorched bodies beneath the tarpaulin brought a certain degree of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 20]: They were supremely uncomfortable , but that was as naught compared with the relaxation from the torments previously borne .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 18]: For a long time -- the best part of an hour , perhaps -- they remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 13]: The sailor was reviewing the pros and cons of their precarious condition .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 22]: It would , of course , be a matter of supreme importance were the Indian to be faithful to his promise .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 7]: Here the prospect was decidedly hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 31]: The man was an old _ sowar _ , and the ex-officer of native cavalry knew how enduring was the attachment of this poor convict to home and military service .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 51]: Probably at that moment the Mahommedan was praying to the Prophet and his two nephews to aid him in rescuing the sahib and the woman whom the sahib held so dear , for the all-wise and all-powerful Sirkar is very merciful to offending natives who thus condone their former crimes .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 17]: But , howsoever willing he might be , what could one man do among so many ?
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 34]: The Dyaks were hostile to him in race and creed , and assuredly infuriated against the foreign devil who had killed or wounded , in round numbers , one-fifth of their total force .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 24]: Very likely , the hapless Mussulman would lose his life that night in attempting to bring water to the foot of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 15]: Well , he , Jenks , might have something to say in that regard .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 13]: By midnight the moon would illumine nearly the whole of Prospect Park .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 28]: If the Mahommedan were slain in front of the cavern his soul would travel to the next world attended by a Nizam 's cohort of slaughtered slaves .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 22]: Even if the man succeeded in eluding the vigilance of his present associates , where was the water to come from ?
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 12]: There was none on the island save that in the well .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 39]: In all likelihood the Dyaks had a store in the remaining sampans , but the native ally of the beleaguered pair would have a task of exceeding difficulty in obtaining one of the jars or skins containing it .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 20]: Again , granting all things went well that night , what would be the final outcome of the struggle ?
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 18]: How long could Iris withstand the exposure , the strain , the heart-breaking misery of the rock ?
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 28]: The future was blurred , crowded with ugly and affrighting fiends passing in fantastic array before his vision , and mouthing dumb threats of madness and death .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 24]: He shook restlessly , not aware that the girl 's sorrowful glance , luminous with love and pain , was fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 38]: Summarily dismissing these grisly phantoms of the mind , he asked himself what the Mahommedan exactly meant by warning him against the trees on the right and the `` silent death '' that might come from them .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 32]: He was about to crawl forth to the lip of the rock and investigate matters in that locality when Iris , who also was busy with her thoughts , restrained him .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 10]: `` Wait a little while , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 14]: `` None of the Dyaks will venture into the open until night falls .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 10]: And I have something to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 15]: There was a quiet solemnity in her voice that Jenks had never heard before .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 4]: It chilled him .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 10]: His heart acknowledged a quick sense of evil omen .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 9]: He raised himself slightly and turned towards her .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 17]: Her face , beautiful and serene beneath its disfigurements , wore an expression of settled purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 11]: For the life of him he dared not question her .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 38]: `` That man , the interpreter , '' she said , `` told you that if I were given up to the chief , he and his followers would go away and molest you no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 7]: His forehead seamed with sudden anger .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 9]: `` A mere bait , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 11]: `` In any event it is hardly worth discussion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 20]: And the answer came , clear and resolute -- `` I think I will agree to those terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 11]: At first he regarded her with undisguised and wordless amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 20]: Then the appalling thought darted through his brain that she contemplated this supreme sacrifice in order to save him .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 30]: A clammy sweat bedewed his brow , but by sheer will power he contrived to say -- `` You must be mad to even dream of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 14]: Do n't you understand what it means to you -- and to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 8]: It is a ruse to trap us .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 5]: They are ungoverned savages .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 18]: Once they had you in their power they would laugh at a promise made to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 6]: `` You may be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 9]: They must have some sense of fair dealing .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 14]: Even assuming that such was their intention , they may depart from it .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 9]: They have already lost a great many men .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 21]: Their chief , having gained his main object , might not be able to persuade them to take further risks .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 19]: I will make it a part of the bargain that they first supply you with plenty of water .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 14]: Then you , unaided , could keep them at bay for many days .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 17]: We lose nothing ; we can gain a great deal by endeavoring to pacify them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 4]: `` Iris ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 10]: he gasped , `` what are you saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 13]: The unexpected sound of her name on his lips almost unnerved her .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 30]: But no martyr ever went to the stake with more settled purpose than this pure woman , resolved to immolate herself for the sake of the man she loved .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 13]: He had dared all for her , faced death in many shapes .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 6]: Now it was her turn .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 19]: Her eyes were lit with a seraphic fire , her sweet face resigned as that of an angel .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 21]: `` I have thought it out , '' she murmured , gazing at him steadily , yet scarce seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 10]: `` It is worth trying as a last expedient .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 26]: We are abandoned by all , save the Lord ; and it does not appear to be His holy will to help us on earth .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 9]: We can struggle on here until we die .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 12]: Is that right , when one of us may live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: Her very candor had betrayed her .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 27]: She would go away with these monstrous captors , endure them , even flatter them , until she and they were far removed from the island .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 8]: And then -- she would kill herself .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 17]: In her innocence she imagined that self-destruction , under such circumstances , was a pardonable offence .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 23]: She only gave a life to save a life , and greater love than this is not known to God or man .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 34]: The sailor , in a tempest of wrath and wild emotion , had it in his mind to compel her into reason , to shake her , as one shakes a wayward child .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 14]: He rose to his knees with this half-formed notion in his fevered brain .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 18]: Then he looked at her , and a mist seemed to shut her out from his sight .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 7]: Was she lost to him already ?
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 25]: Was all that had gone before an idle dream of joy and grief , a wizard 's glimpse of mirrored happiness and vague perils ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 25]: Was Iris , the crystal-souled -- thrown to him by the storm-lashed waves -- to be snatched away by some irresistible and malign influence ?
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 24]: In the mere physical effort to assure himself that she was still near to him he gathered her up in his strong hands .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 12]: Yes , she was there , breathing , wondering , palpitating .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 37]: He folded her closely to his breast , and , yielding to the passionate longings of his tired heart , whispered to her -- `` My darling , do you think I can survive your loss ?
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 7]: You are life itself to me .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 15]: If we have to die , sweet one , let us die together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 9]: Then Iris flung her arms around his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 14]: `` I am quite , quite happy now , '' she sobbed brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 25]: `` I did n't -- imagine -- it would come -- this way , but -- I am thankful -- it has come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 23]: -LSB- Illustration : LOVE , TREMENDOUS IN ITS POWER , UNFATHOMABLE IN ITS MYSTERY , HAD CAST ITS SPELL OVER THEM . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 26]: For a little while they yielded to the glamour of the divine knowledge that amidst the chaos of eternity each soul had found its mate .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 7]: There was no need for words .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 19]: Love , tremendous in its power , unfathomable in its mystery , had cast its spell over them .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 15]: They were garbed in light , throned in a palace built by fairy hands .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 34]: On all sides squatted the ghouls of privation , misery , danger , even grim death ; but they heeded not the Inferno ; they had created a Paradise in an earthly hell .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 10]: Then Iris withdrew herself from the man 's embrace .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 8]: She was delightfully shy and timid now .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 9]: `` So you really do love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 12]: she whispered , crimson-faced , with shining eyes and parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: He drew her to him again and kissed her tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 10]: For he had cast all doubt to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 26]: No matter what the future had in store she was his , his only ; it was not in man 's power to part them .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 7]: A glorious effulgence dazzled his brain .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 15]: Her love had given him the strength of Goliath , the confidence of David .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 11]: He would pluck her from the perils that environed her .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 13]: The Dyak was not yet born who should rend her from him .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 14]: He fondled her hair and gently rubbed her cheek with his rough fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 12]: The sudden sense of ownership of this fair woman was entrancing .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 19]: It almost bewildered him to find Iris nestling close , clinging to him in utter confidence and trust .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 12]: `` But I knew , I knew , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 8]: `` You betrayed yourself so many times .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 34]: You wrote your secret to me , and , though you did not tell me , I found your dear words on the sands , and have treasured them next my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 6]: What girlish romance was this ?
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 17]: He held her away gingerly , just so far that he could look into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 21]: `` Oh , it is true , quite true , '' she cried , drawing the locket from her neck .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 26]: `` Do n't you recognize your own handwriting , or were you not certain , just then , that you really did love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 4]: Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 9]: How often would she repeat that wondrous phrase !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 10]: Together they bent over the tiny slips of paper .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 17]: There it was again -- `` I love you '' -- twice blazoned in magic symbols .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 22]: With blushing eagerness she told him how , by mere accident of course , she caught sight of her own name .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 36]: It was not very wrong , was it , to pick up that tiny scrap , or those others , which she could not help seeing , and which unfolded their simple tale so truthfully ?
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 2]: Wrong !
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 16]: It was so delightfully right that he must kiss her again to emphasize his convictions .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 43]: All this fondling and love-making had , of course , an air of grotesque absurdity because indulged in by two grimy and tattered individuals crouching beneath a tarpaulin on a rocky ledge , and surrounded by bloodthirsty savages intent on their destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 27]: Such incidents require the setting of convention , the conservatory , with its wealth of flowers and plants , a summer wood , a Chippendale drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 29]: And yet , God wot , men and women have loved each other in this grey old world without stopping to consider the appropriateness of place and season .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 47]: After a delicious pause Iris began again -- `` Robert -- I must call you Robert now -- there , there , please let me get a word in even edgeways -- well then , Robert dear , I do not care much what happens now .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 23]: I suppose it was very wicked and foolish of me to speak as I did before -- before you called me Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 6]: Now tell me at once .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 8]: Why did you call me Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 11]: `` You must propound that riddle to your godfather . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 6]: `` No wriggling , please .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 7]: Why did you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: `` Because I could not help myself .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 6]: It slid out unawares . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 16]: `` How long have you thought of me only as Iris , your Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 24]: `` Ever since I first understood that somewhere in the wide world was a dear woman to love me and be loved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 13]: `` But at one time you thought her name was Elizabeth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 7]: `` A delusion , a mirage !
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 15]: That is why those who christened you had the wisdom of the gods . ''
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 3]: Another interlude .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 7]: They grew calmer , more sedate .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 18]: It was so undeniably true they loved one another that the fact was becoming venerable with age .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 11]: Iris was perhaps the first to recognize its quiet certainty .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 23]: `` As I can not get you to talk reasonably , '' she protested , `` I must appeal to your sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 11]: I am hungry , and oh , so thirsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 12]: The girl had hardly eaten a morsel for her midday meal .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: Then she was despondent , utterly broken-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 8]: Now she was filled with new hope .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 8]: There was a fresh motive in existence .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 32]: Whether destined to live an hour or half a century , she would never , never leave him , nor , of course , could he ever , ever leave her .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 14]: Some things were quite impossible -- for example , that they should part .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 19]: Jenks brought her a biscuit , a tin of meat , and that most doleful cup of champagne .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 38]: `` It is not exactly _ frappé _ , '' he said , handing her the insipid beverage , `` but , under other conditions , it is a wine almost worthy to toast you in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 15]: She fancied she had never before noticed what a charming smile he had . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 13]: ` Toast ' is a peculiarly suitable word , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 6]: `` I am simply frizzling .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 9]: In these warm clothes -- '' She stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 29]: For the first time since that prehistoric period when she was `` Miss Deane '' and he `` Mr. Jenks '' she remembered the manner of her garments .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 23]: `` It is not the warm clothing you feel so much as the want of air , '' explained the sailor readily .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 20]: `` This tarpaulin has made the place very stuffy , but we must put up with it until sundown .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 9]: By the way , what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 16]: A light tap on the tarred canvas directly over his head had caught his ear .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 35]: Iris , glad of the diversion , told him she had heard the noise three or four times , but fancied it was caused by the occasional rustling of the sheet on the uprights .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 13]: Jenks had not allowed his attention to wander altogether from external events .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 20]: Since the Dyaks ' last escapade there was no sign of them in the valley or on either beach .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 14]: Not for trivial cause would they come again within range of the Lee-Metfords .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 6]: They waited and listened silently .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 37]: Another tap sounded on the tarpaulin in a different place , and they both concurred in the belief that something had darted in curved flight over the ledge and fallen on top of their protecting shield .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 14]: `` Let us see what the game is , '' exclaimed the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 20]: He crept to the back of the ledge and drew himself up until he could reach over the sheet .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 13]: He returned , carrying in his hand a couple of tiny arrows .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 19]: `` There are no less than seven of these things sticking in the canvas , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 8]: `` They do n't look very terrible .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 20]: I suppose that is what my Indian friend meant by warning me against the trees on the right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 10]: He did not tell Iris all the Mahommedan said .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 9]: There was no need to alarm her causelessly .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 23]: Even whilst they examined the curious little missile another flew up from the valley and lodged on the roof of their shelter .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 20]: The shaft of the arrow , made of some extremely hard wood , was about ten inches in length .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 25]: Affixed to it was a pointed fish-bone , sharp , but not barbed , and not fastened in a manner suggestive of much strength .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 11]: The arrow was neither feathered nor grooved for a bowstring .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 19]: Altogether it seemed to be a childish weapon to be used by men equipped with lead and steel .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 10]: Jenks could not understand the appearance of this toy .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 22]: Evidently the Dyaks believed in its efficacy , or they would not keep on pertinaciously dropping an arrow on the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 8]: `` How do they fire it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 3]: asked Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 7]: `` Do they throw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 16]: `` I will soon tell you , '' he replied , reaching for a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 12]: `` Do not go out yet , '' she entreated him .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 7]: `` They can not harm us .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 9]: Perhaps we may learn more by keeping quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 11]: They will not continue shooting these things all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 12]: Again a tiny arrow traveled towards them in a graceful parabola .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 5]: This one fell short .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 14]: Missing the tarpaulin , it almost dropped on the girl 's outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 5]: She picked it up .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 14]: The fish-bone point had snapped by contact with the floor of the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 9]: She sought for and found the small tip .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 7]: `` See , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 10]: `` It seems to have been dipped in something .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 6]: It is quite discolored . ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 4]: Jenks frowned peculiarly .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 9]: A startling explanation had suggested itself to him .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 11]: Fragments of forgotten lore were taking cohesion in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 5]: `` Put it down .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 10]: Iris obeyed him , with wonder in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 23]: He spilled a teasponful of champagne into a small hollow of the rock and steeped one of the fish-bones in the liquid .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 16]: Within a few seconds the champagne assumed a greenish tinge and the bone became white .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 4]: Then he knew .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 5]: `` Good Heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 13]: he exclaimed , `` these are poisoned arrows shot through a blowpipe .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 15]: I have never before seen one , but I have often read about them .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 8]: The bamboos the Dyaks carried were sumpitans .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 13]: These fish-bones have been steeped in the juice of the upas tree .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 25]: Iris , my dear girl , if one of them had so much as scratched your finger nothing on earth could save you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 9]: She paled and drew back in sudden horror .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 11]: This tiny thing had taken the semblance of a snake .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 30]: A vicious cobra cast at her feet would be less alarming , for the reptile could be killed , whilst his venomous fangs would only be used in self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 8]: Another tap sounded on their thrice-welcome covering .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 17]: Evidently the Dyaks would persist in their efforts to get one of those poisoned darts home .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 51]: Jenks debated silently whether it would be better to create a commotion , thus inducing the savages to believe they had succeeded in inflicting a mortal wound , or to wait until the next arrow fell , rush out , and try conclusions with Dum-dum bullets against the sumpitan blowers .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 9]: He decided in favor of the latter course .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 30]: He wished to dishearten his assailants , to cram down their throats the belief that he was invulnerable , and could visit their every effort with a deadly reprisal .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 12]: Iris , of course , protested when he explained his project .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 6]: But the fighting spirit prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 12]: Their love idyll must yield to the needs of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 7]: He had not long to wait .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 16]: The last arrow fell , and he sprang to the extreme right of the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 10]: First he looked through that invaluable screen of grass .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 17]: Three Dyaks were on the ground , and a fourth in the fork of a tree .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 8]: They were each armed with a blowpipe .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 14]: He in the tree was just fitting an arrow into the bamboo tube .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 6]: The others were watching him .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 19]: Jenks raised his rifle , fired , and the warrior in the tree pitched headlong to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 11]: A second shot stretched a companion on top of him .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 29]: One man jumped into the bushes and got away , but the fourth tripped over his unwieldy sumpitan and a bullet tore a large section from his skull .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 14]: The sailor then amused himself with breaking the bamboos by firing at them .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 8]: He came back to the white-faced girl .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 22]: `` I fancy that further practice with blowpipes will be at a discount on Rainbow Island , '' he cried cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 7]: But Iris was anxious and distrait .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 28]: `` It is very sad , '' she said , `` that we are obliged to secure our own safety by the ceaseless slaughter of human beings .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 23]: Is there no offer we can make them , no promise of future gain , to tempt them to abandon hostilities ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 4]: `` None whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 13]: These Borneo Dyaks are bred from infancy to prey on their fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 15]: To be strangers and defenceless is to court pillage and massacre at their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 14]: I think no more of shooting them than of smashing a clay pigeon .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 11]: Killing a mad dog is perhaps a better simile . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 14]: `` But , Robert dear , how long can we hold out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 9]: Are you growing tired of me already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 12]: He hoped to divert her thoughts from this constantly recurring topic .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 22]: Twice within the hour had it been broached and dismissed , but Iris would not permit him to shirk it again .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 13]: She made no reply , simply regarding him with a wistful smile .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 18]: So Jenks sat down by her side , and rehearsed the hopes and fears which perplexed him .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 12]: He determined that there should be no further concealment between them .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 36]: If they failed to secure water that night , if the Dyaks maintained a strict siege of the rock throughout the whole of next day , well -- they might survive -- it was problematical .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 8]: Best leave matters in God 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 22]: With feminine persistency she clung to the subject , detecting his unwillingness to discuss a possible final stage in their sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 4]: `` Robert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 22]: she whispered fearfully , `` you will never let me fall into the power of the chief , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 7]: `` Not whilst I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 7]: `` You _ must _ live .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 5]: Do n't you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 9]: I would go with them to save you .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 11]: But I would have died -- by my own hand .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 14]: Robert , my love , you must do this thing before the end .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 9]: I must be the first to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 11]: He hung his head in a paroxysm of silent despair .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 19]: Her words rung like a tocsin of the bright romance conjured up by the avowal of their love .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 43]: It seemed to him , in that instant , they had no separate existence as distinguished from the great stream of human life -- the turbulent river that flowed unceasingly from an eternity of the past to an eternity of the future .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 42]: For a day , a year , a decade , two frail bubbles danced on the surface and raced joyously together in the sunshine ; then they were broken -- did it matter how , by savage sword or lingering ailment ?
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 18]: They vanished -- absorbed again by the rushing waters -- and other bubbles rose in precarious iridescence .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 24]: It was a fatalist view of life , a dim and obscurantist groping after truth induced by the overpowering nature of present difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 54]: The famous Tentmaker of Naishapur blindly sought the unending purpose when he wrote : -- `` Up from Earth 's Centre through the Seventh Gate I rose , and on the throne of Saturn sate , And many a Knot unravel 'd by the Road ; But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 44]: `` There was the Door to which I found no Key ; There was the Veil through which I could not see : Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee There was -- and then no more of Thee and Me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: The sailor , too , wrestled with the great problem .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 13]: He may be pardoned if his heart quailed and he groaned aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 34]: `` Iris , '' he said solemnly , `` whatever happens , unless I am struck dead at your feet , I promise you that we shall pass the boundary hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 10]: Be mine the punishment if we have decided wrongly .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 26]: And now , '' he cried , tossing his head in a defiant access of energy , `` let us have done with the morgue .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 17]: For my part I refuse to acknowledge I am inside until the gates clang behind me .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 10]: As for you , you can not help yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: You must do as I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 19]: I never knew of a case where the question of Woman 's Rights was so promptly settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 5]: His vitality was infectious .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 4]: Iris smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 14]: Her sensitive highly strung nerves permitted these sharp alternations between despondency and hope .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 28]: `` You must remember , '' he went on , `` that the Dyak score is twenty-one to the bad , whilst our loss stands at love .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 9]: Dear me , that can not be right .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 8]: Love is surely not a loss . ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 12]: `` A cynic might describe it as a negative gain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 9]: `` Oh , a cynic is no authority .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 9]: He knows nothing whatever about the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 22]: `` My father used to say , when he was in Parliament , that people who knew least oft-times spoke best .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 8]: Some men get overweighted with facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 39]: They chatted in lighter vein with such pendulum swing back to nonchalance that none would have deemed it possible for these two to have already determined the momentous issue of the pending struggle should it go against them .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 24]: There is , glory be , in the Anglo-Saxon race the splendid faculty of meeting death with calm defiance , almost with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 27]: Moments of panic , agonizing memories of bygone days , visions of dear faces never to be seen again , may temporarily dethrone this proud fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 32]: But the tremors pass , the gibbering specters of fear and lamentation are thrust aside , and the sons and daughters of Great Britain answer the last roll-call with undaunted heroism .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 6]: They know how to die .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 38]: And so the sun sank to rest in the sea , and the star , pierced the deepening blue of the celestial arch , whilst the man and the woman awaited patiently the verdict of the fates .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 22]: Before the light failed , Jenks gathered all the poisoned arrows and ground their vemoned points to powder beneath his heel .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 24]: Gladly would Iris and he have dispensed with the friendly protection of the tarpaulin when the cool evening breeze came from the south .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 10]: But such a thing might not be even considered .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 41]: Several hours of darkness must elapse before the moon rose , and during that period , were their foes so minded , they would be absolutely at the mercy of the sumpitan shafts if not covered by their impenetrable buckler .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 10]: The sailor looked long and earnestly at the well .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 19]: Their own bucket , improvised out of a dish-cover and a rope , lay close to the brink .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 36]: A stealthy crawl across the sandy valley , half a minute of grave danger , and he would be up the ladder again with enough water to serve their imperative needs for days to come .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 11]: There was little or no risk in descending the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 21]: Soon after sunset it was wrapped in deepest gloom , for night succeeds day in the tropics with wondrous speed .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 24]: The hazard lay in twice crossing the white sand , were any of the Dyaks hiding behind the house or among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 10]: He held no foolhardy view of his own powers .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 21]: The one-sided nature of the conflict thus far was due solely to his possession of Lee-Metfords as opposed to muzzle-loaders .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 21]: Let him be surrounded on the level at close quarters by a dozen determined men and he must surely succumb .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 19]: Were it not for the presence of Iris he would have given no second thought to the peril .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 13]: It was just one of those undertakings which a soldier jumps at .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 11]: `` Here goes for the V.C. or Kingdom Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 11]: is the pithy philosophy of Thomas Atkins under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 12]: Now , there was no V.C. , but there was Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 14]: To act without consulting her was impossible , so they discussed the project .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 5]: Naturally she scouted it .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 15]: `` The Mahommedan may be able to help us , '' she pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 12]: `` In any event let us wait until the moon wanes .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 6]: That is the darkest hour .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 10]: We do not know what may happen meanwhile . ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 25]: The words had hardly left her mouth when an irregular volley was fired at them from the right flank of the enemy 's position .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 23]: Every bullet struck yards above their heads , the common failing of musketry at night being to take too high an aim .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 39]: But the impact of the missiles on a rock so highly impregnated with minerals caused sparks to fly , and Jenks saw that the Dyaks would obtain by this means a most dangerous index of their faulty practice .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 46]: Telling Iris to at once occupy her safe corner , he rapidly adjusted a rifle on the wooden rests already prepared in anticipation of an attack from that quarter , and fired three shots at the opposing crest , whence came the majority of gun-flashes .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 13]: One , at least , of the three found a human billet .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 19]: There was a shout of surprise and pain , and the next volley spurted from the ground level .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 27]: This could do no damage owing to the angle , but he endeavored to disconcert the marksmen by keeping up a steady fire in their direction .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 27]: He did not dream of attaining other than a moral effect , as there is a lot of room to miss when aiming in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 34]: Soon he imagined that the burst of flame from his rifle helped the Dyaks , because several bullets whizzed close to his head , and about this time firing recommenced from the crest .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 18]: Notwithstanding all his skill and manipulation of the wooden supports , he failed to dislodge the occupants .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 41]: Every minute one or more ounces of lead pitched right into the ledge , damaging the stores and tearing the tarpaulin , whilst those which struck the wall of rock were dangerous to Iris by reason of the molten spray .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 7]: He could guess what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 38]: By lying flat on the sloping plateau , or squeezing close to the projecting shoulder of the cliff , the Dyaks were so little exposed that idle chance alone would enable him to hit one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 19]: But they must be shifted , or this night bombardment would prove the most serious development yet encountered .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 9]: `` Are you all right , Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 4]: he called out .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 9]: `` Yes , dear , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 24]: `` Well , I want you to keep yourself covered by the canvas for a little while -- especially your head and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 8]: I am going to stop these chaps .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 14]: They have found our weak point , but I can baffle them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 10]: She did not ask what he proposed to do .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 12]: He heard the rustling of the tarpaulin as she pulled it .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 20]: Instantly he cast loose the rope-ladder , and , armed only with a revolver , dropped down the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 8]: He was quite invisible to the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 10]: On reaching the ground he listened for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 12]: There was no sound save the occasional reports ninety yards away .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 33]: He hitched up the lower rungs of the ladder until they were six feet from the level , and then crept noiselessly , close to the rock , for some forty yards .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 17]: He halted beside a small poon-tree , and stooped to find something embedded near its roots .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 25]: At this distance he could plainly hear the muttered conversation of the Dyaks , and could see several of them prone on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 18]: The latter fact proved how fatal would be an attempt on his part to reach the well .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 15]: They must discover him instantly once he quitted the somber shadows of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 25]: He waited , perhaps a few seconds longer than was necessary , endeavoring to pierce the dim atmosphere and learn something of their disposition .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 11]: A vigorous outburst of firing sent him back with haste .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 6]: Iris was up there alone .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 7]: He knew not what might happen .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 24]: He was now feverishly anxious to be with her again , to hear her voice , and be sure that all was well .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 13]: To his horror he found the ladder swaying gently against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 6]: Some one was using it .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 19]: He sprang forward , careless of consequence , and seized the swinging end which had fallen free again .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 31]: He had his foot on the bottom rung when Iris 's voice , close at hand and shrill with terror , shrieked -- `` Robert , where are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 12]: he shouted ; the next instant she dropped into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 34]: A startled exclamation from the vicinity of the house , and some loud cries from the more distant Dyaks on the other side of Prospect Park , showed that they had been overheard .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 4]: `` Up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 13]: `` Hold tight , and go as quickly as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 6]: `` Not without you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 8]: `` Up , for God 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 7]: I follow at your heels . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 5]: She began to climb .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 27]: He took some article from between his teeth , a string apparently , and drew it towards him , mounting the ladder at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 4]: The end tightened .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 10]: He was then about ten feet from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 14]: Two Dyaks , yelling fiercely , rushed from the cover of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 10]: `` Go on , '' he said to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 9]: `` Do n't lose your nerve whatever happens .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 7]: I am close behind you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 10]: `` I am quite safe , '' she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 36]: Turning , and clinging on with one hand , he drew his revolver and fired at the pair beneath , who could now faintly discern them , and were almost within reach of the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 6]: The shooting made them halt .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 11]: He did not know or care if they were hit .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 6]: To frighten them was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 23]: Several others were running across the sands to the cave , attracted by the noise and the cries of the foremost pursuers .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 10]: Then he gave a steady pull to the cord .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 15]: The sharp crack of a rifle came from the vicinity of the old quarry .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 8]: He saw the flash among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 18]: Almost simultaneously a bright light leapt from the opposite ledge , illumining the vicinity like a meteor .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 27]: It lit up the rock , showed Iris just vanishing into the safety of the ledge , and revealed Jenks and the Dyaks to each other .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 44]: There followed instantly a tremendous explosion that shook earth and air , dislodging every loose stone in the south-west pile of rocks , hurling from the plateau some of its occupants , and wounding the remainder with a shower of lead and débris .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 28]: The island birds , long since driven to the remote trees , clamored in raucous peal , and from the Dyaks came yells of fright or anguish .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 27]: The sailor , unmolested further , reached the ledge to find Iris prostrate where she had fallen , dead or unconscious , he knew not which .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 10]: He felt his face become grey in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 21]: With a fierce tug he hauled the ladder well away from the ground and sank to his knees beside her .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 7]: He took her into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 5]: There was no light .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 9]: He could not see her eyes or lips .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 33]: Her slight breathing seemed to indicate a fainting fit , but there was no water , nor was it possible to adopt any of the ordinary expedients suited to such a seizure .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 32]: He could only wait in a dreadful silence -- wait , clasping her to his breast -- and dumbly wonder what other loss he could suffer ere the final release came .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 6]: At last she sighed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 10]: A strong tremor of returning life stirred her frame .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 8]: he murmured , and bowed his head .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 17]: Were the sun shining he could not see her now , for his eyes were blurred .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 4]: `` Robert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 6]: `` Yes , darling . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 6]: `` Are you safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 3]: `` Safe !
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 4]: my loved one !
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 4]: Think of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 7]: What has happened to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 7]: `` I fainted -- I think .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 5]: I have no hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 4]: I missed you !
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 7]: Something told me you had gone .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 11]: I went to help you , or die with you .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 5]: And then that noise !
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 4]: And the light !
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 6]: What did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 9]: He silenced her questioning with a passionate kiss .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 20]: He carried her to a little nook and fumbled among the stores until he found a bottle of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 4]: She drank some .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 21]: Under its revivifying influence she was soon able to listen to the explanation he offered -- after securing the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 33]: In a tall tree near the Valley of Death he had tightly fixed a loaded rifle which pointed at a loose stone in the rock overhanging the ledge held by the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 43]: This stone rested against a number of percussion caps extracted from cartridges , and these were in direct communication with a train of powder leading to a blasting charge placed at the end of a twenty-four inch hole drilled with a crowbar .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 18]: The impact of the bullet against the stone could not fail to explode some of the caps .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 34]: He had used the contents of three hundred cartridges to secure a sufficiency of powder , and the bullets were all crammed into the orifice , being tamped with clay and wet sand .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 24]: The rifle was fired by means of the string , the loose coils of which were secreted at the foot of the poon .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 25]: By springing this novel mine he had effectually removed every Dyak from the ledge , over which its contents would spread like a fan .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 16]: Further , it would probably deter the survivors from again venturing near that fatal spot .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 7]: Iris listened , only half comprehending .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 14]: Her mind was filled with one thought to the exclusion of all others .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 13]: Robert had left her , had done this thing without telling her .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 25]: She forgave him , knowing he acted for the best , but he must never , never deceive her again in such a manner .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 6]: She could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 53]: What better excuse could man desire for caressing her , yea , even squeezing her , until the sobs ceased and she protested with a weak little laugh -- `` Robert , I have n't got much breath -- after that excitement -- but please -- leave me -- the remains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 18]: CHAPTER XIV THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS `` You are a dear unreasonable little girl , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 16]: `` Have you breath enough to tell me why you came down the ladder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 14]: `` When I discovered you were gone , I became wild with fright .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 17]: Do n't you see , I imagined you were wounded and had fallen from the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 33]: What else could I do but follow , either to help you , or , if that were not possible -- '' He found her hand and pressed it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 11]: `` I humbly crave your pardon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 8]: `` That explanation is more than ample .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 7]: It was I who behaved unreasonably .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 8]: Of course I should have warned you .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 9]: Yet , sweetheart , I ran no risk .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 9]: The real danger passed a week ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 7]: `` How can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 19]: `` I might have been blown to pieces whilst adjusting the heavy stone in front of the caps .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 17]: I assure you I was glad to leave the place that day with a whole skin .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 22]: If the stone had wobbled , or slipped , well -- it was a case of determined _ felo-de-se _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 16]: `` May I ask how many more wild adventures you undertook without my knowledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 8]: `` One other , of great magnitude .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 8]: I fell in love with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 3]: she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 13]: `` I knew that long before you admitted it to yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 6]: `` Date , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 22]: `` Well , to begin at the very beginning , you thought I was nice on board the _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 7]: Now , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 31]: And they were safely embarked on a conversation of no interest to any other person in the wide world , but which provided them with the most delightful topic imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 19]: Thus the time sped until the rising moon silhouetted the cliff on the white carpet of coral-strewn sand .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 30]: The black shadow-line traveled slowly closer to the base of the cliff , and Jenks , guided also by the stars , told Iris that midnight was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 25]: They knelt on the parapet of the ledge , alert to catch any unusual sound , and watching for any indication of human movement .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 10]: But Rainbow Island was now still as the grave .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 20]: The wounded Dyaks had seemingly been removed from hut and beach ; the dead lay where they had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 23]: The sea sang a lullaby to the reef , and the fresh breeze whispered among the palm fronds -- that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 7]: `` Perhaps they have gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 3]: murmured Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 15]: The sailor put his arm round her neck and gently pressed her lips together .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 23]: Anything would serve as an excuse for that sort of thing , but he really did want absolute silence at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 13]: If the Mussulman kept his compact , the hour was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 10]: An unlooked-for intruder disturbed the quietude of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 16]: Their old acquaintance , the singing beetle , chortled his loud way across the park .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 38]: Iris was dying -- as women say -- to remind Jenks of their first meeting with that blatant insect , but further talk was impossible ; there was too much at stake -- water they must have .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 14]: Then the light hiss of a snake rose to them from the depths .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 10]: That is a sound never forgotten when once heard .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 7]: It is like unto no other .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 25]: Indeed , the term `` hiss '' is a misnomer for the quick sibilant expulsion of the breath by an alarmed or angered serpent .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 36]: Iris paid no heed to it , but Jenks , who knew there was not a reptile of the snake variety on the island , leaned over the ledge and emitted a tolerably good imitation .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 5]: The native was beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 12]: Probably the flight of the beetle had helped his noiseless approach .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 4]: `` Sahib ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 11]: The girl started at the unexpected call from the depths .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Jenks quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 7]: `` A rope , sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 6]: The sailor lowered a rope .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 7]: Something was tied to it beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 10]: The Mahommedan apparently had little fear of being detected .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 6]: `` Pull , sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 21]: `` Usually it is the sahib who says ` pull , ' but circumstances alter cases , '' communed Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 15]: He hauled steadily at a heavy weight -- a goatskin filled with cold water .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 33]: He emptied the hot and sour wine out of the tin cup , and was about to hand the thrice-welcome draught to Iris when a suspicious thought caused him to withhold it .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 10]: `` Let me taste first , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 10]: The Indian might have betrayed them to the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 6]: More unlikely things had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 9]: What if the water were poisoned or drugged ?
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 8]: He placed the tin to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 14]: The liquid was musty , having been in the skin nearly two days .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 8]: Otherwise it seemed to be all right .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 25]: With a sigh of profound relief he gave Iris the cup , and smiled at the most unladylike haste with which she emptied it .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 14]: `` Drink yourself , and give me some more , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 10]: `` No more for you at present , madam .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 8]: In a few minutes , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 8]: `` Oh , why not now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 8]: `` Do not fret , dear one .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 11]: You can have all you want in a little while .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 12]: But to drink much now would make you very ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 8]: Iris waited until he could speak again .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 9]: `` Why did you -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 14]: But he bent over the parapet -- '' _ Koi hai _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 12]: -LSB- Footnote : Equivalent to `` Hello , there ! '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 4]: `` Sahib ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 8]: `` You have not been followed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 7]: `` I think not , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 12]: Do not talk too loud ; they are foxes in cunning .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 10]: You have a ladder , they say , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 6]: Will not your honor descend ?
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 7]: I have much to relate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 12]: Iris made no protest when Jenks explained the man 's request .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 19]: She only stipulated that he should not leave the ladder , whilst she would remain within easy earshot .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 10]: The sailor , of course , carried his revolver .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 14]: He also picked up a crowbar , a most useful and silent weapon .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 6]: Then he went quietly downwards .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 16]: Nearing the ground , he saw the native , who salaamed deeply and was unarmed .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 12]: The poor fellow seemed to be very anxious to help them .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 4]: demanded the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 16]: `` Mir Jan , sahib , formerly _ naik _ -LSB- Footnote : Corporal . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 6]: in the Kumaon Rissala . ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 9]: `` When did you leave the regiment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 7]: `` Two years ago , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 14]: I killed -- '' `` What was the name of your Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 17]: `` Kurnal I-shpence-sahib , a brave man , but of no account on a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 26]: Jenks well remembered Colonel Spence -- a fat , short-legged warrior , who rolled off his charger if the animal so much as looked sideways .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 7]: Mir Jan was telling the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 8]: `` You are right , Mir Jan. .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 8]: What is Taung S'Ali doing now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 10]: `` Cursing , sahib , for the most part .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 5]: His men are frightened .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 18]: He wanted them to try once more with the tubes that shoot poison , but they refused .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 27]: He could not come alone , for he could not use his right hand , and he was wounded by the blowing up of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 9]: You nearly killed me , too , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 8]: I was there with the bazaar-born whelps .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 13]: By the Prophet 's beard , it was a fine stroke . ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 9]: `` Are they going away , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 5]: `` No , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 13]: The dogs have been whipped so sore that they snarl for revenge .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 33]: They say there is no use in firing at you , but they are resolved to kill you and the miss-sahib , or carry her off if she escapes the assault . ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 5]: `` What assault ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 15]: `` Protector of the poor , they are building scaling-ladders -- four in all .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 10]: Soon after dawn they intend to rush your position .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 16]: You may slay some , they say , but you can not slay three score .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 17]: Taung S'Ali has promised a gold _ tauk _ -LSB- Footnote : A native ornament . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 9]: to every man who survives if they succeed .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 19]: They have pulled down your signal on the high rocks and are using the poles for the ladders .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 15]: They think you have a _ jadu _ -LSB- Footnote : A charm . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 14]: sahib , and they want to use your own work against you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 5]: This was serious news .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 26]: A combined attack might indeed be dangerous , though it had the excellent feature that if it failed the Dyaks would certainly leave the island .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 5]: But his sky-sign destroyed !
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 4]: That was bad .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 16]: Had a vessel chanced to pass , the swinging letters would surely have attracted attention .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 9]: Now , even that faint hope was dispelled .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 16]: `` Sahib , there is a worse thing to tell , '' said Mir Jan. .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 7]: `` Say on , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 31]: `` Before they place the ladders against the cliff they will build a fire of green wood so that the smoke will be blown by the wind into your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 8]: This will help to blind your aim .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 7]: Otherwise , you never miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 16]: `` That will assuredly be awkward , Mir Jan. '' `` It will , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 38]: Soul of my father , if we had but half a troop with us -- '' But they had not , and they were both so intent on the conversation that they were momentarily off their guard .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 5]: Iris was more watchful .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 17]: She fancied there was a light rustling amidst the undergrowth beneath the trees on the right .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 15]: And she could hiss too , if that were the correct thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 4]: So she hissed .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 8]: Jenks swarmed half way up the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 6]: `` Yes , Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 19]: `` I am not sure , but I imagine something moved among the bushes behind the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 6]: `` All right , dear .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 7]: I will keep a sharp look-out .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 7]: Can you hear us talking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 3]: `` Hardly .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 6]: Will you be long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 5]: `` Another minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 11]: He descended and told Mir Jan what the miss-sahib said .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 13]: The native was about to make a search when Jenks stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 21]: `` Here , '' -- he handed the man his revolver -- `` I suppose you can use this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 26]: Mir Jan took it without a word , and Jenks felt that the incident atoned for previous unworthy doubts of his dark friend 's honesty .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 19]: The Mahommedan cautiously examined the back of the house , the neighboring shrubs , and the open beach .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 26]: After a brief absence he reported all safe , yet no man has ever been nearer death and escaped it than he during that reconnaissance .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 23]: He , too , forgot that the Dyaks were foxes , and foxes can lie close when hounds are a trifle stale .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 6]: Mir Jan returned the revolver .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 42]: `` Sahib , '' he said with another salaam , `` I am a disgraced man , but if you will take me up there with you , I will fight by your side until both my arms are hacked off .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 7]: I am weary of these thieves .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 16]: Ill chance threw me into their company : I will have no more of them .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 15]: If you will not have me on the rock , give me a gun .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 22]: I will hide among the trees , and I promise that some of them shall die to-night before they find me .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 15]: For the honor of the regiment , sahib , do not refuse this thing .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 36]: All I ask is , if your honor escapes , that you will write to Kurnal I-shpence-sahib , and tell him the last act of Mir Jan , _ naik _ in B troop . ''
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 11]: There was an intense pathos in the man 's words .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 22]: He made this self-sacrificing offer with an utter absence of any motive save the old tradition of duty to the colors .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 13]: Here was Anstruther-sahib , of the Belgaum Rissala , in dire peril .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 23]: Very well , then , Corporal Mir Jan , late of the 19th Bengal Lancers , must dare all to save him .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 5]: Jenks was profoundly moved .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 23]: He reflected how best to utilize the services of this willing volunteer without exposing him to certain death in the manner suggested .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 6]: The native misinterpreted his silence .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 15]: `` I am not a _ budmash _ , -LSB- Footnote : Rascal . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 7]: sahib , '' he exclaimed proudly .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 15]: `` I only killed a man because -- '' `` Listen , Mir Jan. .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 10]: You can not well mend what you have said .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 14]: The Dyaks , you are sure , will not come before morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 15]: `` They have carried the wounded to the boats and are making the ladders .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 10]: Such was their talk when I left them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 8]: `` Will they not miss you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 15]: `` They will miss the _ mussak _ , -LSB- Footnote : Goatskin . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 2]: sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 8]: It was the last full one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 24]: `` Mir Jan , do as I bid , and you shall see Delhi again , Have you ever used a Lee-Metford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 16]: `` I have seen them , sahib ; but I better understand the Mahtini . ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 30]: `` I will give you a rifle , with plenty of ammunition , Do you go inside the cave , there , and -- '' Mir Jan was startled .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 9]: `` Where the ghost is , sahib ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 3]: `` Ghost !
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 7]: That is a tale for children .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 19]: There is no ghost , only a few bones of a man murdered by these scoundrels long ago .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 6]: Have you any food ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 18]: `` Some rice , sahib ; sufficient for a day , or two at a pinch . ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 8]: We will get water from the well .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 20]: When the fighting begins at dawn , fire at every man you see from the back of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 6]: On no account come out .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 13]: Then they can never reach you if you keep a full magazine .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 4]: Wait here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 17]: `` I thought you were never coming , '' protested Iris when Jenks reached the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 7]: `` I have been quite creepy .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 10]: I am sure there is some one down there .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 11]: And , please , may I have another drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 8]: The sailor had left the crowbar beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 34]: He secured a rifle , a spare clip , and a dozen packets of cartridges , meanwhile briefly explaining to Iris the turn taken by events so far as Mir Jan was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 22]: She was naturally delighted , and forgot her fears in the excitement caused by the appearance of so useful an ally .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 11]: She drank his health in a brimming beaker of water .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 27]: She heard her lover rejoin Mir Jan , and saw the two step out into the moonlight , whilst Jenks explained the action of the Lee-Metford .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 16]: Fortunately Iris was now much recovered from the fatigue and privation of the earlier hours .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 34]: Her senses were sharpened to a pitch little dreamed of by stay-at-home young ladies of her age , and she deemed it her province to act as sentry whilst the two men conferred .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 32]: Hence , she was the first to detect , or rather to become conscious of , the stealthy crawl of several Dyaks along the bottom of the cliff from Turtle Beach .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 27]: They advanced in Indian file , moving with the utmost care , and crouching in the murky shadows like so many wild beasts stalking their prey .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 4]: `` Robert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 4]: `` The Dyaks !
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 5]: On your left ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 10]: But Iris was rapidly gaining some knowledge of strategy .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 10]: Before she shrieked her warning she grasped a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 40]: Holding it at the `` Ready '' -- about the level of her waist -- and depressing the muzzle sufficiently , she began firing down the side of the rock as fast as she could handle lever and trigger .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 17]: Two of the nickel bullets struck a projection and splashed the leading savages with molten metal .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 18]: Unfortunately the Lee-Metford beneath was unloaded , being in Mir Jan 's possession for purposes of instruction .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 6]: Jenks whipped out his revolver .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 6]: `` To the cave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 31]: he roared , and Mir Jan 's unwillingness to face a goblin could not withstand the combined impetus of the sahib 's order and the onward rush of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 7]: He darted headlong for the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 23]: -LSB- Illustration : IRIS BEGAN FIRING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE ROCK AS FAST AS SHE COULD HANDLE LEVER AND TRIGGER . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 26]: Jenks , shooting blindly as he , too , ran for the ladder , emptied the revolver just as his left hand clutched a rung .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 15]: Three Dyaks were so close that it would be folly to attempt to climb .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 29]: He threw the weapon into the face of the foremost man , effectually stopping his onward progress , for the darkness made it impossible to dodge the missile .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 28]: The sailor turned to dive into the cave and secure the rifle from Mir Jan , when his shin caught the heavy crowbar resting against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 23]: The pain of the blow lent emphasis to the swing with which the implement descended upon some portion of a Dyak anatomy .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 18]: Jenks never knew where he hit the second assailant , but the place cracked like an eggshell .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 37]: He had not time to recover the bar for another blow , so he gave the point in the gullet of a gentleman who was about to make a vicious sweep at him with a parang .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 18]: The downfall of this worthy caused his immediate successor to stumble , and Jenks saw his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 12]: With the agility of a cat he jumped up the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 9]: Once started , he had to go on .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 48]: He afterwards confessed to an unpleasant sensation of pins and needles along his back during that brief acrobatic display ; but he reached the ledge without further injury , save an agonizing twinge when the unprotected quick of his damaged finger was smartly rapped against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 9]: These things happened with the speed of thought .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 28]: Within forty seconds of Iris 's shrill cry the sailor was breast high with the ledge and calling to her -- `` All right , old girl .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 5]: Keep it up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 13]: The cheerful confidence of his words had a wonderful effect on her .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 33]: Iris , like every good woman , had the maternal instinct strong within her -- the instinct that inspires alike the mild-eyed Sister of Charity and the tigress fighting for her cubs .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 43]: When Jenks was down below there , in imminent danger of being cut to pieces , the gentle , lovable girl , who would not willingly hurt the humblest of God 's creatures , became terrible , majestic in her frenzied purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 5]: Robert must be saved .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 22]: If a Maxim were planted on the rock she would unhesitatingly have turned the lever and sprayed the Dyaks with bullets .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 24]: But here he was close to her , unhurt and calmly jubilant , as was his way when a stiff fight went well .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 48]: He was by her side now , firing and aiming too , for the Dyaks broke cover recklessly in running for shelter , and one may do fair work by moonlight , as many a hunter of wild duck can testify by the rheumatism in his bones .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 31]: She had strength enough left to place the rifle out of harm 's way before she broke down and sobbed , not tearfully , but in a paroxysm of reaction .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 24]: Soon all was quiet beneath , save for the labored efforts of some wounded men to get far away from that accursed rock .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 8]: Jenks was able to turn to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 21]: He endeavored to allay her agitation , and succeeded somewhat , for tears came , and she clung to him .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 7]: It was useless to reproach him .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 14]: The whole incident was unforeseen : she was herself a party to it .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 5]: But what an escape !
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 21]: He lifted her in his arms and carried her to a seat where the tarpaulin rested on a broken water-cask .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 19]: `` You have been a very good little girl and have earned your supper , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 16]: `` Oh , how can you talk so callously after such an awful experience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 4]: she expostulated brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 19]: The Jesuits , say their opponents , teach that at times a `` white lie '' is permissible .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 6]: Surely this was an instance .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 16]: `` It is a small thing to trouble about , sweetheart , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 25]: `` You spotted the enemy so promptly , and blazed away with such ferocity , that they never got within yards of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 29]: `` I vow and declare that after we have eaten something , and sampled our remaining bottle of wine , I will tell you exactly what happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 6]: `` Why not now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 10]: `` Because I must first see to Mir Jan. .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 10]: I bundled him neck and crop into the cave .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 9]: I hope I did not hurt him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 10]: `` You are not going down there again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 8]: `` No need , I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 39]: He went to the side of the ledge , recovered the ladder which he had hastily hauled out of the Dyaks ' reach after his climb , and cried -- `` Mir Jan. '' `` Ah , sahib !
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 13]: Praised be the name of the Most High , you are alive .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 12]: I was searching among the slain with a sorrowful heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 13]: The Mahommedan 's voice came from some little distance on the left .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 7]: `` The slain , you say .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 4]: How many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 6]: `` Five , sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 3]: `` Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 18]: I fired blindly with the revolver , and only hit one man hard with the iron bar .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 13]: One other dropped near the wood after I obtained a rifle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 13]: `` Then there be six , sahib , not reckoning the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 22]: I have accounted for one , so the miss-sahib must have -- '' `` What is he saying about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 11]: inquired Iris , who had risen and joined her lover .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 17]: `` He says you absolutely staggered the Dyaks by opening fire the moment they appeared . ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 15]: `` How did _ you _ come to slay one , Mir Jan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 3]: he continued .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 13]: `` A son of a black pig followed me into the cave .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 8]: I waited for him in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 10]: I have just thrown his body outside . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 3]: _ Shabash !
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 10]: _ -LSB- Footnote : `` Well done ! '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 11]: Is Taung S'Ali dead , by any lucky chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 12]: `` No , sahib , if he be not the sixth .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 7]: I will go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 7]: `` You may be attacked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 9]: `` I have found a sword , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 7]: You left me no cartridges . ''
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 26]: Jenks told him that the clip and the twelve packets were lying at the foot of the rock , where Mir Jan speedily discovered them .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 20]: The Mahommedan gave satisfactory assurance that he understood the mechanism of the rifle by filling and adjusting the magazine .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 20]: Then he went to examine the corpse of the man who lay in the open near the quarry path .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 16]: The sailor stood in instant readiness to make a counter demonstration were the native assailed .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 9]: But there was no sign of the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 21]: Mir Jan returned with the news that the sixth victim of the brief yet fierce encounter was a renegade Malay .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 37]: He was so confident that the enemy had had enough of it for the night that , after recovering Jenks 's revolver , he boldly went to the well and drew himself a supply of water .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 42]: During supper , a feast graced by a quart of champagne worthy of the Carlton , Jenks told Iris so much of the story as was good for her : that is to say , he cut down the casualty list .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 9]: It was easy to see what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 25]: The Dyaks , having missed the Mahommedan and their water-bag , searched for him and heard the conversation at the foot of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 26]: Knowing that their presence was suspected , they went back for reinforcements , and returned by the shorter and more advantageous route along Turtle Beach .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 31]: Iris would have talked all night , but Jenks made her go to sleep , by pillowing her head against his shoulder and smoothing her tangled tresses with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 8]: The wine , too , was helpful .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 18]: In a few minutes her voice became dreamy : soon she was sleeping like a tired child .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 18]: He managed to lay her on a comfortable pile of ragged clothing and then resumed his vigil .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 29]: Mir Jan offered to mount guard beneath , but Jenks bade him go within the cave and remain there , for the dawn would soon be upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 18]: Left alone with his thoughts , he wondered what the rising sun would bring in its train .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 10]: He reviewed the events of the last twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 47]: Iris and he -- Miss Deane , Mr. Jenks , to each other -- were then undiscovered in their refuge , the Dyaks were gathered around a roaring fire in the valley , and Mir Jan was keen in the hunt as the keenest among them .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 39]: Now , Iris was his affianced bride , over twenty of the enemy were killed and many wounded , and Mir Jan , a devoted adherent , was seated beside the skeleton in the gloom of the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 11]: What a topsy-turvy world it was , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 7]: What alternations between despair and hope !
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 13]: What rebound from the gates of Death to the threshold of Eden !
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 16]: How untrue , after all , was the nebulous philosophy of Omar , the Tentmaker .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 39]: Surely in the happenings of the bygone day there was more than the purposeless `` Magic Shadow-show , Play 'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun , Round which we Phantom Figures come and go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 11]: He had , indeed , cause to be humbly thankful .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 25]: Was there not One who marked the fall of a sparrow , who clothed the lilies , who knew the needs of His creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 30]: There , in the solemn temple of the night , he gave thanks for the protection vouchsafed to Iris and himself , and prayed that it might be continued .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 25]: He deplored the useless bloodshed , the horror of mangled limbs and festering bodies , that converted this fair island into a reeking slaughter-house .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 35]: Were it possible , by any personal sacrifice , to divert the untutored savages from their deadly quest , he would gladly condone their misdeeds and endeavor to assuage the torments of the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 23]: But he was utterly helpless , a pawn on that tiny chessboard where the game was being played between Civilization and Barbarism .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 18]: The fight must go on to the bitter end : he must either vanquish or be vanquished .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 23]: There were other threads being woven into the garment of his life at that moment , but he knew not of them .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 13]: Sufficient for the day was the evil , and the good thereof .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 8]: Of both he had received full measure .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 16]: A period of such reflection could hardly pass without a speculative dive into the future .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 21]: If Iris and he were rescued , what would happen when they went forth once more into the busy world ?
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 10]: Not for one instant did he doubt her faith .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 16]: She was true as steel , knit to him now by bonds of triple brass .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 20]: But , what would Sir Arthur Deane think of his daughter 's marriage to a discredited and cashiered officer ?
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 10]: What was it that poor Mir Jan called himself ?
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 7]: -- `` a disgraced man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 6]: Yes , that was it .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 6]: Could that stain be removed ?
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 6]: Mir Jan was doing it .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 4]: Why not he ?
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 18]: -- by other means , for his good name rested on the word of a perjured woman .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 8]: Wealth was potent , but not all-powerful .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 24]: He would ask Iris to wait until he came to her unsoiled by slander , purged of this odium cast upon him unmerited .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 49]: And all this goes to show that he , a man wise beyond his fellows , had not yet learned the unwisdom of striving to lift the veil of tomorrow , behind whose mystic curtain what is to be ever jostles out of place what is hoped for .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 14]: Iris , smiling in her dreams , was assailed by no torturing doubts .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 8]: Robert loved her -- that was enough .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 18]: Love suffices for a woman ; a man asks for honor , reputation , an unblemished record .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 21]: To awake her he kissed her ; he knew not , perchance it might be their last kiss on earth .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 29]: Not yet dawn , there was morning in the air , for the first faint shafts of light were not visible from their eyrie owing to its position .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 8]: But there was much to be done .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 21]: If the Dyaks carried out the plan described by Mir Jan , he had a good many preparations to make .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 18]: The canvas awning was rolled back and the stores built into a barricade intended to shelter Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 7]: `` What is that for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 9]: she asked , when she discovered its nature .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 4]: He told her .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 11]: She definitely refused to avail herself of any such protection .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 28]: `` Robert dear , '' she said , `` if the attack comes to our very door , so to speak , surely I must help you .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 19]: Even my slight aid may stem a rush in one place whilst you are busy in another . ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 26]: He explained to her that if hand-to-hand fighting were necessary he would depend more upon a crowbar than a rifle to sweep the ledge clear .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 7]: She might be in the way .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 15]: The moment you tell me to get behind that fence I will do so .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 9]: Even there I can use a revolver . ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 4]: That reminded him .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 6]: His own pistol was unloaded .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 10]: He possessed only five more cartridges of small caliber .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 12]: He placed them in the weapon and gave it to her .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 16]: `` Now you have eleven men 's lives in your hands , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 11]: `` Try not to miss if you must shoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 17]: In the dim light he could not see the spasm of pain that clouded her face .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 9]: No Dyak would reach her whilst he lived .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 14]: If he fell , there was another use for one of those cartridges .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 29]: The sailor had cleared the main floor of the rock and was placing his four rifles and other implements within easy reach when a hiss came from beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 5]: `` Mir Jan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 3]: exclaimed Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 5]: `` What now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 6]: demanded Jenks over the side .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 7]: `` Sahib , they come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 5]: `` I am prepared .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 22]: Let that snake get back to his hole in the rock , lest a mongoose seize him by the head . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 23]: Mir Jan , engaged in a scouting expedition on his own account , understood that the officer-sahib 's orders must be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 3]: He vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 39]: Soon they heard a great crackling among the bushes on the right , but Jenks knew even before he looked that the Dyaks had correctly estimated the extent of his fire zone and would keep out of it .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 36]: The first physical intimation of the enemy 's design they received was a pungent but pleasant smell of burning pine , borne to them by the northerly breeze and filling the air with its aroma .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 7]: The Dyaks kindled a huge fire .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 27]: The heat was perceptible even on the ledge , but the minutes passed , and the dawn broadened into day without any other result being achieved .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 27]: Iris , a little drawn and pale with suspense , said with a timid giggle -- `` This does not seem to be so very serious .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 10]: It reminds me of my efforts to cook . ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 13]: `` There is more to follow , I fear , dear one .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 6]: But the Dyaks are fools .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 19]: They should have waited until night fell again , after wearing us out by constant vigilance all day .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 17]: If they intend to employ smoke it would be far worse for us at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 2]: Phew !
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 19]: A volume of murky vapor arose that nearly suffocated them by the first whiff of its noisome fumes .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 19]: It curled like a black pall over the face of the rock and blotted out sea and sky .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 25]: They coughed incessantly , and nearly choked , for the Dyaks had thrown wet seaweed on top of the burning pile of dry wood .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 31]: Mir Jan , born in interior India , knew little about the sea or its products , and when the savages talked of seaweed he thought they meant green wood .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 21]: Fortunately for him , the ascending clouds of smoke missed the cave , or infallibly he must have been stifled .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 8]: `` Lie flat on the rock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 3]: gasped Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 23]: Careless of waste , he poured water over a coat and made Iris bury her mouth and nose in the wet cloth .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 24]: This gave her immediate relief , and she showed her woman 's wit by tying the sleeves of the garment behind her neck .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 18]: Jenks nodded comprehension and followed her example , for by this means their hands were left free .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 10]: The black cloud grew more dense each few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 30]: Nevertheless , owing to the slope of the ledge , and the tendency of the smoke to rise , the south side was far more tenable than the north .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 16]: Quick to note this favorable circumstance , the sailor deduced a further fact from it .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 16]: A barrier erected on the extreme right of the ledge would be a material gain .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 36]: He sprang up , dragged the huge tarpaulin from its former location , and propped it on the handle of the pickaxe , driven by one mighty stroke deep into a crevice of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 11]: It was no mean feat of strength that he performed .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 17]: He swung the heavy and cumbrous canvas into position as if it were a dust cloth .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 13]: He emerged from the gloom of the driven cloud red-eyed but triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 16]: Instantly the vapor on the ledge lessened , and they could breathe , even talk .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 23]: Overhead and in front the smoke swept in ever-increasing density , but once again the sailor had outwitted the Dyaks ' manoeuvres .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 14]: `` We have won the first rubber , '' he whispered to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 11]: Above , beneath , beyond , they could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 9]: The air they breathed was hot and foetid .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 14]: It was like being immured in a foul tunnel and almost as dark .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 6]: Jenks looked over the parapet .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 18]: He thought he could distinguish some vague figures on the sands , so he fired at them .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 13]: A volley of answering bullets crashed into the rock on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 10]: The Dyaks had laid their plans well this time .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 41]: A firing squad stationed beyond the smoke area , and supplied with all the available guns , commenced and kept up a smart fusillade in the direction of the ledge in order to cover the operations of the scaling party .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 18]: Jenks realized that to expose himself was to court a serious wound and achieve no useful purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 16]: He fell back out of range , laid down his rifle and grabbed the crowbar .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 13]: At brief intervals a deep hollow boom came up from the valley .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 13]: At first it puzzled them until the sailor hit upon an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 5]: Mir Jan was busy .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 18]: The end of a strong roughly made ladder swung through the smoke and banged against the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 13]: Before Jenks could reach it those hoisting it into position hastily retreated .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 22]: They were standing in front of the cave and the Mahommedan made play on them with a Lee-Metford at thirty feet .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 15]: Jenks , using his crowbar as a lever , toppled the ladder clean over .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 11]: It fell outwards and disconcerted a section of the musketeers .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 8]: `` Well done , '' cried Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 14]: The sailor , astounded by her tone , gave her a fleeting glance .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 11]: She was very pale now , but not with fear .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 19]: Her eyes were slightly contracted , her nostrils quivering , her lips set tight and her chin dimpled .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 11]: She had gone back thirty generations in as many seconds .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 21]: Thus might one of the daughters of Boadicea have looked whilst guiding her mother 's chariot against the Roman phalanx .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 26]: Resting on one knee , with a revolver in each hand , she seemed no puling mate for the gallant man who fought for her .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 5]: She caught his look .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 8]: `` We will beat them yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 27]: she cried again , and she smiled , not as a woman smiles , but with the joy of a warrior when the fray is toward .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 8]: There was no time for further speech .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 8]: Three ladders were reared against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 15]: They were so poised and held below that Jenks could not force them backwards .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 18]: A fourth appeared , its coarse shafts looming into sight like the horns of some gigantic animal .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 22]: The four covered practically the whole front of the ledge save where Mir Jan cleared a little space on the level .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 14]: The sailor was standing now , with the crowbar clenched in both hands .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 10]: The firing in the valley slackened and died away .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 21]: A Dyak face , grinning like a Japanese demon , appeared at the top of the ladder nearest to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 6]: `` Do n't fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 10]: shouted Jenks , and the iron bar crushed downwards .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 10]: Two others pitched themselves half on to the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 8]: Now both crowbar and revolver were needed .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 20]: Three ladders were thus cumbered somewhat for those beneath , and Jenks sprang towards the fourth and most distant .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 7]: Men were crowding it like ants .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 9]: Close to his feet lay an empty water-cask .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 45]: It was a crude weapon , but effective when well pitched , and the sailor had never made a better shot for a goal in the midst of a hard-fought scrimmage than he made with that tub for the head of the uppermost pirate .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: Another volley came from the sands .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 15]: A bullet ploughed through his hair , and sent his sou ` wester flying .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 8]: Again the besiegers swarmed to the attack .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 10]: One way or the other , they must succeed .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 36]: A man and a woman -- even such a man and such a woman -- could not keep at bay an infuriated horde of fifty savages fighting at close quarters and under these grievous conditions .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 6]: Jenks knew what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 15]: He would be shot in the head or breast whilst repelling the scaling party .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 3]: And Iris !
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 3]: Dear heart !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 6]: She was thinking of him .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 4]: `` Keep back !
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 8]: They can never gain the ledge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 3]: she shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 39]: And then , above the din of the fusillade , the yells of the assailants and the bawling of the wounded , there came through the air a screaming , tearing , ripping sound which drowned all others .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 40]: It traveled with incredible speed , and before the sailor could believe his ears -- for he well knew what it meant -- a shrapnel shell burst in front of the ledge and drenched the valley with flying lead .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 21]: Jenks was just able to drag Iris flat against the rock ere the time fuse operated and the bullets flew .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 10]: He could form no theory , hazard no conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 24]: All he knew was that a 12-pounder shell had flown towards them through space , scattering red ruin among the amazed scoundrels beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 20]: Instantly he rose again , lest perchance any of the Dyaks should have gained a foothold on the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 5]: The ladders were empty .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 20]: He could hear a good deal of groaning , the footsteps of running men , and some distant shouting .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 4]: `` Sahib ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 13]: yelled Mir Jan , drawn from his retreat by the commotion without .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' shouted Jenks .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 14]: The native , in a voice cracked with excitement , told him something .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 18]: The sailor asked a few rapid questions to make quite sure that Mir Jan was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 22]: Then he threw his arms round Iris , drew her close and whispered -- `` My darling , we are saved !
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 23]: A warship has anchored just beyond the south reef , and two boats filled with armed sailors are now pulling ashore . ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 16]: And she answered proudly -- `` The Dyaks could never have conquered us , Robert .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 8]: We were manifestly under God 's protection .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 16]: Oh , my love , my love , I am so happy and thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 26]: CHAPTER XV THE DIFFICULTY OF PLEASING EVERYBODY The drifting smoke was still so dense that not even the floor of the valley could be discerned .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 10]: Jenks dared not leave Iris at such a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 15]: He feared to bring her down the ladder lest another shell might be fired .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 10]: But something must be done to end their suspense .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 30]: He called to Mir Jan -- `` Take off your turban and hold it above your head , if you think they can see you from the warship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 14]: `` It is all right , sahib , '' came the cheering answer .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 7]: `` One boat is close inshore .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 21]: I think , from the uniforms , they are English sahibs , such as I have seen at Garden Reach .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 7]: The Dyaks have all gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 4]: Nevertheless Jenks waited .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 10]: There was nothing to gain by being too precipitate .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 12]: A false step now might undo the achievements of many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 13]: Mir Jan was dancing about beneath in a state of wild excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 29]: `` They have seen the Dyaks running to their sampans , sahib , '' he yelled , `` and the second boat is being pulled in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 9]: Yet another has just left the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 15]: A translation made Iris excited , eager to go down and see these wonders .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 11]: `` Better wait here , dearest , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 21]: `` The enemy may be driven back in this direction , and I can not expose you to further risk .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 16]: The sailors will soon land , and you can then descend in perfect safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 10]: The boom of a cannon came from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 31]: Instinctively the girl ducked for safety , though her companion smiled at her fears , for the shell would have long preceded the report , had it traveled their way .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 25]: `` One of the remaining sampans has got under way , '' he explained , `` and the warship is firing at her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 6]: Two more guns were fired .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 9]: The man-o ' - war evidently meant business .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 5]: `` Poor wretches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 3]: murmured Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 11]: `` Can not the survivors be allowed to escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 9]: `` Well , we are unable to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 31]: Those caught on the island will probably be taken to the mainland and hanged for their crimes , so the manner of their end is not of much consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 26]: To the girl 's manifest relief there was no more firing , and Mir Jan announced that a number of sailors were actually on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 21]: Then her thoughts turned to a matter of concern to the feminine mind even in the gravest moments of existence .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 12]: She laved her face with water and sought her discarded skirt !
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 45]: Soon the steady tramp of boot-clad feet advancing at the double was heard on the shingle , and an officer 's voice , speaking the crude Hindustani of the engine-room and forecastle , shouted to Mir Jan -- `` Hi , you black fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 8]: Are there any white people here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 11]: Jenks sang out -- `` Yes , two of us !
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 8]: Perched on the rock over your heads .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 6]: We are coming down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 6]: He cast loose the rope-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 6]: Iris was limp and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 9]: `` Steady , sweetheart , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 13]: `` Do n't forget the slip between the cup and the lip .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 3]: Hold tight !
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 5]: But have no fear !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 7]: I will be just beneath . ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 8]: It was well he took this precaution .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 16]: She was now so unnerved that an unguarded movement might have led to an accident .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 28]: But the knowledge that her lover was near , the touch of his hand guiding her feet on to the rungs of the ladder , sustained her .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 25]: They had almost reached the level when a loud exclamation and the crash of a heavy blow caused Jenks to halt and look downwards .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 26]: A Dyak , lying at the foot of one of the scaling ladders , and severely wounded by a shell splinter , witnessed their descent .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 15]: In his left hand he grasped a parang ; his right arm was bandaged .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 19]: Though unable to rise , the vengeful pirate mustered his remaining strength to crawl towards the swaying ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 16]: It was Taung S'Ali , inspired with the hate and venom of the dying snake .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 22]: Even yet he hoped to deal a mortal stroke at the man who had defied him and all his cut-throat band .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 25]: He might have succeeded , as Jenks was so taken up with Iris , were it not for the watchful eyes of Mir Jan. .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 37]: The Mahommedan sprang at him with an oath , and gave him such a murderous whack with the butt of a rifle that the Dyak chief collapsed and breathed out his fierce spirit in a groan .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 18]: At the first glance Jenks did not recognize Taung S'Ali , owing to his change of costume .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 12]: Through the thinner smoke he could see several sailors running up .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 7]: `` Look out , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 7]: `` There is a lady here .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 12]: If any Dyak moves , knock him on the head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 15]: But , with the passing of the chief , their last peril had gone .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 33]: The next instant they were standing on the firm ground , and a British naval lieutenant was saying eagerly -- `` We seem to have turned up in the nick of time .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 15]: Do you , by any chance , belong to the _ Sirdar _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 12]: `` We are the sole survivors , '' answered the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 6]: `` You two only ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 13]: She struck on the north-west reef of this island during a typhoon .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 18]: This lady , Miss Iris Deane , and I were flung ashore -- '' `` Miss Deane !
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 5]: Can it be possible ?
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 7]: Let me congratulate you most heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 15]: Sir Arthur Deane is on board the _ Orient _ at this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 7]: `` The _ Orient _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 4]: Iris was dazed .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 32]: The uniforms , the pleasant faces of the English sailors , the strange sensation of hearing familiar words in tones other than those of the man she loved , bewildered her .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' explained the officer , with a sympathetic smile .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 15]: `` That 's our ship , you know , in the offing there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 11]: It was all too wonderful to be quite understood yet .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 10]: She turned to Robert -- `` Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 9]: They say my father is not far away .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 6]: Take me to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 16]: -LSB- Illustration : `` WE ARE THE SOLE SURVIVORS , '' ANSWERED THE SAILOR . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 14]: `` No need for that , miss , '' interrupted a warrant officer .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 7]: `` Here he is coming ashore .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 25]: He wanted to come with us , but the captain would not permit it , as there seemed to be some trouble ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 37]: Sure enough , even the girl 's swimming eyes could distinguish the grey-bearded civilian seated beside an officer in the stern-sheets of a small gig now threading a path through the broken reef beyond Turtle Beach .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 10]: In five minutes , father and daughter would meet .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 12]: Meanwhile the officer , intent on duty , addressed Jenks again .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: `` May I ask who you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 10]: `` My name is Anstruther -- Robert Anstruther . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 11]: Iris , clinging to his arm , heard the reply .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 7]: So he had abandoned all pretence .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 11]: He was ready to face the world at her side .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 23]: She stole a loving glance at him as she cried -- `` Yes , Captain Anstruther , of the Indian Staff Corps .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 34]: If he will not tell you all that he has done , how he has saved my life twenty times , how he has fought single-handed against eighty men , ask me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 30]: The naval officer did not need to look a second time at Iris 's face to lengthen the list of Captain Anstruther 's achievements , by one more item .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 3]: He sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 17]: A good sailor always does sigh when a particularly pretty girl is labeled `` Engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 7]: But he could be very polite .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 22]: `` Captain Anstruther does not appear to have left much for us to do , Miss Deane , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 22]: `` Indeed , '' turning to Robert , `` is there any way in which my men will be useful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 18]: `` I would recommend that they drag the green stuff off that fire and stop the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 41]: Then , a detachment should go round the north side of the island and drive the remaining Dyaks into the hands of the party you have landed , as I understand , at the further end of the south beach .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 26]: Mir Jan , the Mahommedan here , who has been a most faithful ally during part of our siege , will act as guide . ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 55]: The other man cast a comprehensive glance over the rock , with its scaling ladders and dangling rope-ladder , the cave , the little groups of dead or unconscious pirates -- for every wounded man who could move a limb had crawled away after the first shell burst -- and drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 9]: `` How long were you up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 6]: `` Over thirty hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 8]: `` It was a great fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 11]: `` Somewhat worse than it looks , '' said Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 9]: `` This is only the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 15]: Altogether , we have accounted for nearly two score of the poor devils . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 18]: `` Do you think you can make them prisoners , without killing any more of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 3]: asked Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 10]: `` That depends entirely on themselves , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 13]: My men will not fire a shot unless they encounter resistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 7]: Robert looked towards the approaching boat .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 11]: She would not land yet for a couple of minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 18]: `` By the way , '' he said , `` will you tell me your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 9]: `` Playdon -- Lieutenant Philip H. Playdon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 12]: `` Do you know to what nation this island belongs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 10]: `` It is no-man 's land , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 11]: It is marked ` uninhabited ' on the chart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 86]: `` Then , '' said Anstruther , `` I call upon you , Lieutenant Playdon , and all others here present , to witness that I , Robert Anstruther , late of the Indian Army , acting on behalf of myself and Miss Iris Deane , declare that we have taken possession of this island in the name of His Britannic Majesty the King of England , that we are the joint occupiers and owners thereof , and claim all property rights vested therein . ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 14]: These formal phrases , coming at such a moment , amazed his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 10]: Iris alone had an inkling of the underlying motive .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 19]: `` I do n't suppose any one will dispute your title , '' said the naval officer gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 35]: He unquestionably imagined that suffering and exposure had slightly disturbed the other man 's senses , yet he had seldom seen any person who looked to be in more complete possession of his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 22]: `` Thank you , '' replied Robert with equal composure , though he felt inclined to laugh at Playdon 's mystification .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 16]: `` I only wished to secure a sufficient number of witnesses for a verbal declaration .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 24]: When I have a few minutes to spare I will affix a legal notice on the wall in front of our cave . ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 4]: Playdon bowed silently .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 12]: There was something in the speaker 's manner that puzzled him .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 30]: He detailed a small guard to accompany Robert and Iris , who now walked towards the beach , and asked Mir Jan to pilot him as suggested by Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 29]: The boat was yet many yards from shore when Iris ran forward and stretched out her arms to the man who was staring at her with wistful despair .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 3]: `` Father !
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 3]: Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 8]: `` Do n't you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 22]: Sir Arthur Deane was looking at the two strange figures on the sands , and each moment his heart sank lower .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 7]: This island held his final hope .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 46]: During many weary weeks , since the day when a kindly Admiral placed the cruiser _ Orient _ at his disposal , he had scoured the China Sea , the coasts of Borneo and Java , for some tidings of the ill-fated _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 15]: He met naught save blank nothingness , the silence of the great ocean mausoleum .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 25]: Not a boat , a spar , a lifebuoy , was cast up by the waves to yield faintest trace of the lost steamer .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 8]: Every naval man knew what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 29]: The vessel had met with some mishap to her machinery , struck a derelict , or turned turtle , during that memorable typhoon of March 17 and 18 .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 8]: She had gone down with all hands .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 7]: Her fate was a foregone conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 20]: No ship 's boat could live in that sea , even if the crew were able to launch one .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 17]: It was another of ocean 's tragedies , with the fifth act left to the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 17]: To examine every sand patch and tree-covered shoal in the China Sea was an impossible task .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 23]: All the _ Orient _ could do was to visit the principal islands and institute inquiries among the fishermen and small traders .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 74]: At last , the previous night , a Malay , tempted by hope of reward , boarded the vessel when lying at anchor off the large island away to the south , and told the captain a wondrous tale of a devil-haunted place inhabited by two white spirits , a male and a female , whither a local pirate named Taung S'Ali had gone by chance with his men and suffered great loss .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 27]: But Taung S'Ali was bewitched by the female spirit , and had returned there , with a great force , swearing to capture her or perish .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 16]: The spirits , the Malay said , had dwelt upon the island for many years .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 11]: His father and grandfather knew the place and feared it .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 8]: Taung S'Ali would never be seen again .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 31]: This queer yarn was the first indication they received of the whereabouts of any persons who might possibly be shipwrecked Europeans , though not survivors from the _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 27]: Anyhow , the tiny dot lay in the vessel 's northward track , so a course was set to arrive off the island soon after dawn .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 17]: Events on shore , as seen by the officer on watch , told their own tale .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 22]: Wherever Dyaks are fighting there is mischief on foot , so the _ Orient _ took a hand in the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 37]: But Sir Arthur Deane , after an agonized scrutiny of the weird-looking persons escorted by the sailors to the water 's edge , sadly acknowledged that neither of these could be the daughter whom he sought .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 33]: He bowed his head in humble resignation , and he thought he was the victim of a cruel hallucination when Iris 's tremulous accents reached his ears -- `` Father , father !
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 7]: Do n't you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 8]: He stood up , amazed and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 6]: `` Yes , father dear .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 13]: It is I , your own little girl given back to you .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 10]: I can not see you for my tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 25]: They had some difficulty to keep him in the boat , and the man pulling stroke smashed a stout oar with the next wrench .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 26]: And so they met at last , and the sailors left them alone , to crowd round Anstruther and ply him with a hundred questions .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 74]: Although he fell in with their humor , and gradually pieced together the stirring story which was supplemented each instant by the arrival of disconsolate Dyaks and the comments of the men who returned from cave and beach , his soul was filled with the sight of Iris and her father , and the happy , inconsequent demands with which each sought to ascertain and relieve the extent of the other 's anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 14]: Then Iris called to him -- `` Robert , I want you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 13]: The use of his Christian name created something akin to a sensation .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 25]: Sir Arthur Deane was startled , even in his immeasurable delight at finding his child uninjured -- the picture of rude health and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 3]: Anstruther advanced .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 14]: `` This is my father , '' she cried , shrill with joy .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 41]: `` And , father darling , this is Captain Robert Anstruther , to whom alone , under God 's will , I owe my life , many , many times since the moment the _ Sirdar _ was lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 7]: It was no time for questioning .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 41]: Sir Arthur Deane took off his hat and held out his hand -- `` Captain Anstruther , '' he said , `` as I owe you my daughter 's life , I owe you that which I can never repay .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 24]: And I owe you my own life , too , for I could not have survived the knowledge that she was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 26]: Robert took the proffered hand -- `` I think , Sir Arthur , that , of the two , I am the more deeply indebted .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 29]: There are some privileges whose value can not be measured , and among them the privilege of restoring your daughter to your arms takes the highest place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 29]: Then , being much more self-possessed than the older man , who was naturally in a state of agitation that was almost painful , he turned to Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 24]: `` I think , '' he said , `` that your father should take you on board the _ Orient _ , Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 24]: There you may , perhaps , find some suitable clothing , eat something , and recover from the exciting events of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 19]: Afterwards , you must bring Sir Arthur ashore again , and we will guide him over the island .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 13]: I am sure you will find much to tell him meanwhile . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 39]: The baronet could not fail to note the manner in which these two addressed each other , the fearless love which leaped from eye to eye , the calm acceptance of a relationship not be questioned or gainsaid .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 31]: Robert and Iris , without spoken word on the subject , had tactily agreed to avoid the slightest semblance of subterfuge as unworthy alike of their achievements and their love .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 8]: Yet what could Sir Arthur Deane do ?
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 16]: To frame a suitable protest at such a moment was not to be dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 11]: As yet he was too shaken to collect his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 21]: Anstruther 's proposal , however , helped him to blurt out what he intuitively felt to be a disagreeable fact .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 11]: Yet something must be said , for his brain reeled .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 18]: `` Your suggestion is admirable , '' he cried , striving desperately to affect a careless complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 32]: `` The ship 's stores may provide Iris with some sort of rig-out , and an old friend of hers is on board at this moment , little expecting her presence .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 9]: Lord Ventnor has accompanied me in my search .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 34]: He will , of course , be delighted -- '' Anstruther flushed a deep bronze , but Iris broke in -- `` Father , why did _ he _ come with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 14]: Sir Arthur , driven into this sudden squall of explanation , became dignified .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 24]: `` Well , you see , my dear , under the circumstances , he felt an anxiety almost commensurate with my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 7]: `` But why , why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 5]: Iris was quite calm .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 8]: With Robert near , she was courageous .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 18]: Even the perturbed baronet experienced a new sensation as his troubled glance fell before her searching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 11]: His daughter had left him a joyous , heedless girl .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 12]: He found her a woman , strong , self-reliant , purposeful .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 25]: Yet he kept on , choosing the most straightforward means as the only honorable way of clearing a course so beset with unsuspected obstacles .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 34]: `` It is only reasonable , Iris , that your affianced husband should suffer an agony of apprehension on your account , and do all that was possible to effect your rescue . ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 8]: `` My -- affianced -- husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 20]: `` Well , my dear girl , perhaps that is hardly the correct phrase from your point of view .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 38]: Yet you can not fail to remember that Lord Ventnor -- '' `` Father , dear , '' said Iris solemnly , but in a voice free from all uncertainty , `` my affianced husband stands here !
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 11]: We plighted our troth at the very gate of death .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 16]: It was ratified in the presence of God , and has been blessed by Him .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 9]: I have made no compact with Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 8]: He is a base and unworthy man .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 21]: Did you but know the truth concerning him you would not mention his name in the same breath with mine .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 6]: Would he , Robert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 10]: Never was man so perplexed as the unfortunate shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 81]: In the instant that his beloved daughter was restored to him out of the very depths of the sea , he was asked either to undertake the rôle of a disappointed and unforgiving parent , or sanction her marriage to a truculent-looking person of most forbidding if otherwise manly appearance , who had certainly saved her from death in ways not presently clear to him , but who could not be regarded as a suitable son-in-law solely on that account .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 17]: What could he do , what could he say , to make the position less intolerable ?
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 17]: Anstruther , quicker than Iris to appreciate Sir Arthur Deane 's dilemma , gallantly helped him .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 11]: He placed a loving hand on the girl 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 19]: `` Be advised by me , Sir Arthur , and you too , Iris , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 9]: `` This is no hour for such explanations .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 8]: Leave me to deal with Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 14]: I am content to trust the ultimate verdict to you , Sir Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 11]: You will learn in due course all that has happened .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 6]: Go on board , Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 11]: Meet Lord Ventnor as you would meet any other friend .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 9]: You will not marry him , I know .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 6]: I can trust you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 14]: He said this with a smile that robbed the words of serious purport .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 22]: `` Believe me , you two can find plenty to occupy your minds today without troubling yourselves about Lord Ventnor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 55]: `` I am very much obliged to you , '' murmured the baronet , who , notwithstanding his worry , was far too experienced a man of the world not to acknowledge the good sense of this advice , no matter how ruffianly might be the guise of the strange person who gave it .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 31]: `` That is settled , then , '' said Robert , laughing good-naturedly , for he well knew what a weird spectacle he must present to the bewildered old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 37]: Even Sir Arthur Deane was fascinated by the ragged and hairy giant who carried himself so masterfully and helped everybody over the stile at the right moment He tried to develop the change in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 21]: `` By the way , '' he said , `` how came you to be on the _ Sirdar _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 20]: I have a list of all the passengers and crew , and your name does not appear therein . ''
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 9]: `` Oh , that is easily accounted for .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 14]: I shipped as a steward , in the name of Robert Jenks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 4]: `` Robert Jenks !
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 4]: A steward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 6]: This was worse than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 10]: The unhappy shipowner thought the sky must have fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 10]: That forms some part of the promised explanation . ''
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 11]: Iris rapidly gathered the drift of her lover 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 10]: `` Come , father , '' she cried merrily .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 31]: `` I am aching to see what the ship 's stores , which you and Robert pin your faith to , can do for me in the shape of garments .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 35]: I have the utmost belief in the British navy , and even a skeptic should be convinced of its infallibility if H.M.S. _ Orient _ is able to provide a lady 's outfit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 11]: Sir Arthur Deane gladly availed himself of the proffered compromise .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 37]: He assisted Iris into the boat , though that active young person was far better able to support him , and a word to the officer in command sent the gig flying back to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 16]: Anstruther , during a momentary delay , made a small request on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 32]: Lieutenant Playdon , nearly as big a man as Robert , despatched a note to his servant , and the gig speedily returned with a complete assortment of clothing and linen .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 35]: The man also brought a dressing case , with the result that a dip in the bath , and ten minutes in the hands of an expert valet , made Anstruther a new man .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 61]: Acting under his advice , the bodies of the dead were thrown into the lagoon , the wounded were collected in the hut to be attended to by the ship 's surgeon , and the prisoners were paraded in front of Mir Jan , who identified every man , and found , by counting heads , that none was missing .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 17]: Robert did not forget to write out a formal notice and fasten it to the rock .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 47]: This proceeding further mystified the officers of the _ Orient _ , who had gradually formed a connected idea of the great fight made by the shipwrecked pair , though Anstruther squirmed inwardly when he thought of the manner in which Iris would picture the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 20]: As it was , he had the first innings , and he did not fail to use the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 31]: In the few terse words which the militant Briton best understands , he described the girl 's fortitude , her unflagging cheerfulness , her uncomplaining readiness to do and dare .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 33]: Little was said by his auditors , save to interpolate an occasional question as to why such and such a thing was necessary , or how some particular drawback had been surmounted .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 31]: Standing near the well , it was not necessary to move to explain to them the chief features of the island , and point out the measures he had adopted .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 51]: When he ended , the first lieutenant , who commanded the boats sent in pursuit of the flying Dyaks -- the _ Orient _ sank both sampans as soon as they were launched -- summed up the general verdict -- `` You do not need our admiration , Captain Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 14]: Each man of us envies you from the bottom of his soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 26]: `` I do , I know -- from the very bilge , '' exclaimed a stout midshipman , one of those who had seen Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 8]: Robert waited until the laugh died away .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 13]: `` There is an error about my rank , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 25]: `` I did once hold a commission in the Indian army , but I was court-marshaled and cashiered in Hong Kong six months ago .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 18]: I was unjustly convicted on a grave charge , and I hope some day to clear myself .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 7]: Meanwhile I am a mere civilian .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 21]: It was only Miss Deane 's generous sympathy which led her to mention my former rank , Mr. Playdon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 32]: Had another of the _ Orient 's _ 12-pounder shells suddenly burst in the midst of the group of officers , it would have created less dismay than this unexpected avowal .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 2]: Court-martialed !
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 2]: Cashiered !
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 23]: None but a service man can grasp the awful significance of those words to the commissioned ranks of the army and navy .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 8]: Anstruther well knew what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 14]: Somehow , he found nothing hard in the performance of these penances now .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 17]: Of course , the ugly truth must be revealed the moment Lord Ventnor heard his name .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 52]: It was not fair to the good fellows crowding around him , and offering every attention that the frank hospitality of the British sailor could suggest , to permit them to adopt the tone of friendly equality which rigid discipline , if nothing else , would not allow them to maintain .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 32]: The first lieutenant , by reason of his rank , was compelled to say something -- `` That is a devilish bad job , Mr. Anstruther , '' he blurted out .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 13]: `` Well , you know , I had to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 8]: He smiled unaffectedly at the wondering circle .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 13]: He , too , was an officer , and appreciated their sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 34]: They were unfeignedly sorry for him , a man so brave and modest , such a splendid type of the soldier and gentleman , yet , by their common law , an outcast .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 8]: Nor could they wholly understand his demeanor .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 22]: There was a noble dignity in his candor , a conscious innocence that disdained to shield itself under a partial truth .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 25]: He spoke , not as a wrong-doer , but as one who addresses those who have been and will be once more his peers .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 30]: The first lieutenant again phrased the thoughts of his juniors -- `` I , and every other man in the ship , can not help but sympathize with you .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 34]: But whatever may be your record -- if you were an escaped convict , Mr. Anstruther -- no one could withhold from you the praise deserved for your magnificent stand against overwhelming odds .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 5]: Our duty is plain .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 18]: We will bring you to Singapore , where the others will no doubt wish to go immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 16]: I will tell the Captain what you have been good enough to acquaint us with .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 18]: Meanwhile we will give you every assistance , and -- er -- attention in our power . ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 10]: A murmur of approbation ran through the little circle .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 6]: Robert 's face paled somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 10]: What first-rate chaps they were , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 12]: `` I can only thank you , '' he said unsteadily .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 10]: `` Your kindness is more trying than adversity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 43]: A rustle of silk , the intrusion into the intent knot of men of a young lady in a Paris gown , a Paris hat , carrying a Trouville parasol , and most exquisitely gloved and booted , made every one gasp .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 12]: `` Oh , Robert dear , how _ could _ you ?
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 8]: I actually did n't know you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 33]: Thus Iris , bewitchingly attired , and gazing now with provoking admiration at Robert , who certainly offered almost as great a contrast to his former state as did the girl herself .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 7]: He returned her look with interest .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 22]: `` Would any man believe , '' he laughed , `` that clothes would do so much for a woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 6]: `` What a left-handed compliment !
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 18]: But come , dearest , Captain Fitzroy and Lord Ventnor have come ashore with father and me .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 8]: They want us to show them everything !
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 10]: You will excuse him , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 11]: she added , with a seraphic smile to the others .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 5]: They walked off together .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 4]: `` Jimmy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 9]: gasped the fat midshipman to a lanky youth .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 9]: `` She 's got on your togs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 30]: Meaning that Iris had ransacked the _ Orient 's _ theatrical wardrobe , and pounced on the swell outfit of the principal female impersonator in the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 26]: Lieutenant Playdon bit the chin strap of his pith helmet , for the landing party wore the regulation uniform for service ashore in the tropics .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 20]: He muttered to his chief -- `` Damme if I 've got the hang of this business yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 19]: `` Neither have I. Anstruther looks a decent sort of fellow , and the girl is a stunner .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 27]: Yet , d'ye know , Playdon , right through the cruise I 've always understood that she was the fiancée of that cad , Ventnor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 9]: `` Anstruther appears to have arranged matters differently .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 15]: Wonder what pa will say when that Johnnie owns up about the court-martial . ''
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 20]: `` Give it up , which is more than the girl will do , or I 'm much mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 32]: Funny thing , you know , but I 've a sort of hazy recollection of Anstruther 's name being mixed up with that of a Colonel 's wife at Hong Kong .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 11]: Fancy Ventnor was in it too , as a witness .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 15]: Stand by , and we 'll see something before we unload at Singapore . ''
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 13]: CHAPTER XVI BARGAINS , GREAT AND SMALL Lord Ventnor was no fool .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 53]: Whilst Iris was transforming herself from a semi-savage condition into a semblance of an ultra _ chic _ Parisienne -- the _ Orient 's _ dramatic costumier went in for strong stage effects in feminine attire -- Sir Arthur Deane told the Earl something of the state of affairs on the island .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 48]: His lordship -- a handsome , saturnine man , cool , insolently polite , and plentifully endowed with the judgmatical daring that is the necessary equipment of a society libertine -- counseled patience , toleration , even silent recognition of Anstruther 's undoubted claims for services rendered .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 26]: `` She is an enthusiastic , high-spirited girl , '' he urged upon his surprised hearer , who expected a very different expression of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 38]: `` This fellow Anstruther is a plausible sort of rascal , a good man in a tight place too -- just the sort of fire-eating blackguard who would fill the heroic bill where a fight is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 9]: Damn him , he licked me twice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 6]: Further amazement for the shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 8]: `` Yes , it 's quite true .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 20]: I interfered with his little games , and he gave me the usual reward of the devil 's apothecary .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 4]: Leave Iris alone .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 20]: At present she is strung up to an intense pitch of gratitude , having barely escaped a terrible fate .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 8]: Let her come back to the normal .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 9]: Anstruther 's shady record must gradually leak out .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 5]: That will disgust her .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 13]: In a week she will appeal to you to buy him off .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 16]: He is hard up -- cut off by his people and that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 10]: There you probably have the measure of his scheming .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 12]: He knows quite well that he can never marry your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 9]: It is all a matter of price . ''
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 9]: Sir Arthur willingly allowed himself to be persuaded .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 23]: At the back of his head there was an uneasy consciousness that it was not `` all a matter of price . ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 13]: If it were he would never trust a man 's face again .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 8]: But Ventnor 's well-balanced arguments swayed him .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 9]: The course indicated was the only decent one .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 22]: It was humanly impossible for a man to chide his daughter and flout her rescuer within an hour of finding them .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 10]: Lord Ventnor played his cards with a deeper design .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 6]: He bowed to the inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 7]: Iris said she loved his rival .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 17]: To attempt to dissuade her was to throw her more closely into that rival 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 20]: The right course was to appear resigned , saddened , compelled against his will to reveal the distressing truth .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 14]: Further , he counted on Anstruther 's quick temper as an active agent .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 16]: Such a man would be the first to rebel against an assumption of pitying tolerance .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 16]: He would bring bitter charges of conspiracy , of unbelievable compact to secure his ruin .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 15]: All this must recoil on his own head when the facts were laid bare .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 17]: Not even the hero of the island could prevail against the terrible indictment of the court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 17]: Finally , at Singapore , three days distant , Colonel Costobell and his wife were staying .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 12]: Lord Ventnor , alone of those on board , knew this .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 18]: Indeed , he accompanied Sir Arthur Deane largely in order to break off a somewhat trying entanglement .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 36]: He smiled complacently as he thought of the effect on Iris of Mrs. Costobell 's indignant remonstrances when the baronet asked that injured lady to tell the girl all that had happened at Hong Kong .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 22]: In a word , Lord Ventnor was most profoundly annoyed , and he cursed Anstruther from the depths of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 8]: But he could see a way out .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 12]: The more desperate the emergency the more need to display finesse .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 10]: Above all , he must avoid an immediate rupture .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 21]: He came ashore with Iris and her father ; the captain of the _ Orient _ also joined the party .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 17]: The three men watched Robert and the girl walking towards them from the group of officers .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 12]: `` Anstruther is a smart-looking fellow , '' commented Captain Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 6]: `` Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 31]: Truth to tell , the gallant commander of the _ Orient _ was secretly amazed by the metamorphosis effected in Robert 's appearance since he scrutinized him through his glasses .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 37]: Iris , too , unaccustomed to the constraint of high-heeled shoes , clung to the nondescript 's arm in a manner that shook the sailor 's faith in Lord Ventnor 's pretensions as her favored suitor .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 40]: Poor Sir Arthur said not a word , but his lordship was quite at ease -- `` From his name , and from what Deane tells me , I believe he is an ex-officer of the Indian Army . ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 7]: He has left the service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 9]: I met him last in Hong Kong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 7]: `` Then you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 13]: `` Quite well , if he is the man I imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 14]: `` That is really very nice of Ventnor , '' thought the shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 16]: `` The last thing I should credit him with would be a forgiving disposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 9]: Meanwhile Anstruther was reading Iris a little lecture .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 21]: `` Sweet one , '' he explained to her , `` do not allude to me by my former rank .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 7]: I am not entitled to it .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 13]: Some day , please God , it will be restored to me .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 9]: At present I am a plain civilian . ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 8]: `` I think you very handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 11]: `` Do n't tease , there 's a good girl .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 11]: It is not fair with all these people looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 23]: `` But really , Robert , only since you scraped off the upper crust have I been able to recognize you again .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 15]: I remember now that I thought you were a most distinguished looking steward . ''
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 7]: `` Well , I am helpless .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 7]: I can not even squeeze you .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 18]: By the way , Iris , during the next few days say nothing about our mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 7]: `` Oh , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 6]: `` Just a personal whim .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 6]: It will please me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 13]: `` If it pleases you , Robert , I am satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 9]: He pressed her arm by way of answer .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 12]: They were too near to the waiting trio for other comment .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 17]: `` Captain Fitzroy , '' cried Iris , `` let me introduce Mr. Anstruther to you .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 11]: Lord Ventnor , you have met Mr. Anstruther before . ''
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 5]: The sailor shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 5]: Lord Ventnor smiled affably .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 18]: `` Your enforced residence on the island seems to have agreed with you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 3]: `` Admirably .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 15]: Life here had its drawbacks , but we fought our enemies in the open .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 7]: Did n't we , Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 5]: `` Yes , dear .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 15]: The poor Dyaks were not sufficiently modernized to attack us with false testimony . ''
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 8]: His lordship 's sallow face wrinkled somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 24]: So Iris knew of the court-martial , nor was she afraid to proclaim to all the world that this man was her lover .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 22]: As for Captain Fitzroy , his bushy eyebrows disappeared into his peaked cap when he heard the manner of their speech .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 5]: Nevertheless Ventnor smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 12]: `` Even the Dyaks respected Miss Deane , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 43]: But Anstruther , sorry for the manifest uneasiness of the shipowner , repressed the retort on his lips , and forthwith suggested that they should walk to the north beach in the first instance , that being the scene of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 11]: During the next hour he became auditor rather than narrator .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 112]: It was Iris who told of his wild fight against wind and waves , Iris who showed them where he fought with the devil-fish , Iris who expatiated on the long days of ceaseless toil , his dauntless courage in the face of every difficulty , the way in which he rescued her from the clutch of the savages , the skill of his preparations against the anticipated attack , and the last great achievement of all , when , time after time , he foiled the Dyaks ' best-laid plans , and flung them off , crippled and disheartened , during the many phases of the thirty hours ' battle .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 6]: She had an attentive audience .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 22]: Most of the _ Orient 's _ officers quietly came up and followed the girl 's glowing recital with breathless interest .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 13]: Robert vainly endeavored more than once to laugh away her thrilling eulogy .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 8]: But she would have none of it .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 7]: Her heart was in her words .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 41]: He deserved this tribute of praise , unstinted , unmeasured , abundant in its simple truth , yet sounding like a legend spun by some romantic poet , were not the grim evidences of its accuracy visible on every hand .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 57]: She was so volubly clear , so precise in fact , so subtle in her clever delineations of humorous or tragic events , that her father was astounded , and even Anstruther silently admitted that a man might live until he equaled the years of a Biblical patriarch without discovering all the resources of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 53]: There were tears in her eyes when she ended ; but they were tears of thankful happiness , and Lord Ventnor , a silent listener who missed neither word nor look , felt a deeper chill in his cold heart as he realized that this woman 's love could never be his .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 8]: The knowledge excited his passion the more .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 24]: His hatred of Anstruther now became a mania , an insensate resolve to mortally stab this meddler who always stood in his path .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 9]: Robert hoped that his present ordeal was over .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 5]: It had only begun .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 10]: He was called on to answer questions without number .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 7]: Why had the tunnel been made ?
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 10]: What was the mystery of the Valley of Death ?
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 12]: How did he manage to guess the dimensions of the sun-dial ?
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 21]: How came he to acquire such an amazing stock of out-of-the-way knowledge of the edible properties of roots and trees ?
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 2]: How ?
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 2]: Where ?
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 2]: When ?
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 38]: They never would be satisfied , for not even the British navypoking its nose into the recesses of the world -- often comes across such an amazing story as the adventures of this couple on Rainbow Island .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 25]: He readily explained the creation of quarry and cave by telling them of the vein of antimony embedded in the rock near the fault .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 13]: Antimony is one of the substances that covers a multitude of doubts .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 30]: No one , not excepting the doctors who use it , knows much about it , and in Chinese medicine it might be a chief factor of exceeding nastiness .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 49]: Inside the cavern , the existence of the partially completed shaft to the ledge accounted for recent disturbances on the face of the rock , and new-comers could not , of course , distinguish the bones of poor `` J.S. '' as being the remains of a European .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 33]: Anstruther was satisfied that none of them hazarded the remotest guess as to the value of the gaunt rock they were staring at , and chance helped him to baffle further inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 27]: A trumpeter on board the _ Orient _ was blowing his lungs out to summon them to luncheon , when Captain Fitzroy put a final query .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 24]: `` I can quite understand , '' he said to Robert , `` that you have an affection for this weird place . ''
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 17]: `` I should think so indeed , '' muttered the stout midshipman , glancing at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 22]: `` But I am curious to know , '' continued the commander , `` why you lay claim to the island ?
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 9]: You can hardly intend to return here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 11]: He pointed to Robert 's placard stuck on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 6]: Anstruther paused before he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 13]: He felt that Lord Ventnor 's dark eyes were fixed on him .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 13]: Everybody was more or less desirous to have this point cleared up .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 9]: He looked the questioner squarely in the face .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 42]: `` In some parts of the world , '' he said , `` there are sunken reefs , unknown , uncharted , on which many a vessel has been lost without any contributory fault on the part of her officers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 4]: `` Undoubtedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 29]: `` Well , Captain Fitzroy , when I was stationed with my regiment in Hong Kong I encountered such a reef , and wrecked my life on it .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 12]: At least , that is how it seemed to me then .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 13]: Fortune threw me ashore here , after a long and bitter submergence .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 20]: You can hardly blame me if I cling to the tiny speck of land that gave me salvation . ''
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 8]: `` No , '' admitted the sailor .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 22]: He knew there was something more in the allegory than the text revealed , but it was no business of his .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 17]: `` Moreover , '' continued Robert smilingly , `` you see I have a partner . ''
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 18]: `` There can not be the slightest doubt about the partner , '' was the prompt reply .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 31]: Then every one laughed , Iris more than any , though Sir Arthur Deane 's gaiety was forced , and Lord Ventnor could taste the acidity of his own smile .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 19]: Later in the day the first lieutenant told his chief of Anstruther 's voluntary statement concerning the court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 29]: Captain Fitzroy was naturally pained by this unpleasant revelation , but he took exactly the same view as that expressed by the first lieutenant in Robert 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 18]: Nevertheless he pondered the matter , and seized an early opportunity of mentioning it to Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 19]: That distinguished nobleman was vastly surprised to learn how Anstruther had cut the ground from beneath his feet .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' he said , in reply to the sailor 's request for information , `` I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 22]: It could not well be otherwise , seeing that next to Mrs. Costobell I was the principal witness against him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 18]: `` That must have been d -- d awkward for you , '' was the unexpected comment .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 18]: `` Because rumor linked your name with that of the lady in a somewhat outspoken way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 5]: `` You astonish me .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 26]: Anstruther certainly made some stupid allegations during the trial ; but I had no idea he was able to spread this malicious report subsequently . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 20]: `` I am not talking of Hong Kong , my lord , but of Singapore , months later . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 8]: Captain Fitzroy 's tone was exceedingly dry .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 9]: Indeed , some people might deem it offensive .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 12]: His lordship permitted himself the rare luxury of an angry scowl .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 15]: `` Rumor is a lying jade at the best , '' he said curtly .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 48]: `` You must remember , Captain Fitzroy , that I have uttered no word of scandal about Mr. Anstruther , and any doubts concerning his conduct can be set at rest by perusing the records of his case in the Adjutant-General 's office at Hong Kong . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 4]: `` Hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 13]: said the sailor , turning on his heel to enter the chart-room .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 29]: This was no way to treat a real live lord , a personage of some political importance , too , such as the Special Envoy to Wang Hai .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 8]: Evidently , Iris was no mean advocate .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 18]: She had already won for the `` outcast '' the suffrages of the entire ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 13]: The girl and her father went back to the island with Robert .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 19]: After taking thought , the latter decided to ask Mir Jan to remain in possession until he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 10]: There was not much risk of another Dyak invasion .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 47]: The fate of Taung S'Ali 's expedition would not encourage a fresh set of marauders , and the Mahommedan would be well armed to meet unforeseen contingencies , whilst on his , Anstruther 's , representations the _ Orient _ would land an abundance of stores .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 52]: In any event , it was better for the native to live in freedom on Rainbow Island than to be handed over to the authorities as an escaped convict , which must be his immediate fate no matter what magnanimous view the Government of India might afterwards take of his services .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 7]: Mir Jan 's answer was emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 13]: He took off his turban and placed it on Anstruther 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 13]: `` Sahib , '' he said , `` I am your dog .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 26]: If , some day , I am found worthy to be your faithful servant , then shall I know that Allah has pardoned my transgressions .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 14]: I only killed a man because -- '' `` Peace , Mir Jan. .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 5]: Let him rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 10]: `` Why is he worshiping you , Robert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 3]: demanded Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 4]: He told her .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 17]: `` Really , '' she cried , `` I must keep up my studies in Hindustani .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 7]: It is quite too sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 30]: And then , for the benefit of her father , she rattled off into a spirited account of her struggles with the algebraic x and the Urdu compound verb .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 9]: Sir Arthur Deane managed to repress a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 11]: In spite of himself he could not help liking Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 12]: The man was magnetic , a hero , an ideal gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 9]: No wonder his daughter was infatuated with him .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 15]: Yet the future was dark and storm-tossed , full of sinister threats and complications .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 27]: Iris did not know the wretched circumstances which had come to pass since they parted , and which had changed the whole aspect of his life .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 6]: How could he tell her ?
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 17]: Why should it be his miserable lot to snatch the cup of happiness from her lips ?
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 23]: In that moment of silent agony he wished he were dead , for death alone could remove the burthen laid on him .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 16]: Well , surely he might bask in the sunshine of her laughter for another day .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 17]: No need to embitter her joyous heart until he was driven to it by dire necessity .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 28]: So he resolutely brushed aside the woe-begone phantom of care , and entered into the _ abandon _ of the hour with a zest that delighted her .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 33]: The dear girl imagined that Robert , her Robert , had made another speedy conquest , and Anstruther himself was much elated by the sudden change in Sir Arthur Deane 's demeanor .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 9]: They behaved like school children on a picnic .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 22]: They roared over Iris 's troubles in the matter of divided skirts , too much divided to be at all pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 15]: The shipowner tasted some of her sago bread , and vowed it was excellent .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 23]: They unearthed two bottles of champagne , the last of the case , and promised each other a hearty toast at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 26]: Nothing would content Iris but that they should draw a farewell bucketful of water from the well and drench the pitcher-plant with a torrential shower .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 16]: Robert carefully secured the pocket-books , money and other effects found on their dead companions .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 17]: The baronet , of course , knew all the principal officers of the _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 9]: He surveyed these mournful relics with sorrowful interest .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 25]: `` The _ Sirdar _ was the crack ship of my fleet , and Captain Ross my most trusted commander , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 35]: `` You may well imagine , Mr. Anstruther , what a cruel blow it was to lose such a vessel , with all these people on board , and my only daughter amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 11]: I wonder now that it did not kill me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 9]: `` She was a splendid sea-boat , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 10]: Although disabled , she fought gallantly against the typhoon .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 11]: Nothing short of a reef would break her up . ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 29]: `` Ah , well , '' sighed the shipowner , `` the few timbers you have shown me here are the remaining assets out of # 300,000 . ''
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 7]: `` Was she not insured ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 3]: inquired Robert .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 30]: `` No ; that is , I have recently adopted a scheme of mutual self-insurance , and the loss falls _ pro rata _ on my other vessels . ''
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 7]: The baronet glanced covertly at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 8]: The words conveyed little meaning to her .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 37]: Indeed , she broke in with a laugh -- `` I am afraid I have heard you say , father dear , that some ships in the fleet paid you best when they ran ashore . ''
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 5]: `` Yes , Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 8]: That often happened in the old days .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 5]: It is different now .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 13]: Moreover , I have not told you the extent of my calamities .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 22]: The _ Sirdar _ was lost on March 18 , though I did not know it for certain until this morning .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 37]: But on March 25 the _ Bahadur _ was sunk in the Mersey during a fog , and three days later the _ Jemadar _ turned turtle on the James and Mary shoal in the Hooghly .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 13]: Happily there were no lives lost in either of these cases . ''
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 10]: Even Iris was appalled by this list of casualties .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 8]: `` My poor , dear dad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 17]: `` To think that all these troubles should occur the very moment I left you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 17]: Yet she gave no thought to the serious financial effect of such a string of catastrophes .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 24]: Robert , of course , appreciated this side of the business , especially in view of the shipowner 's remark about the insurance .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 11]: But Sir Arthur Deane 's stiff upper lip deceived him .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 17]: He failed to realize that the father was acting a part for his daughter 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 20]: Oddly enough , the baronet did not seek to discuss with them the legal-looking document affixed near the cave .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 22]: It claimed all rights in the island in their joint names , and this was a topic he wished to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 29]: For the time , therefore , the younger man had no opportunity of taking him into his confidence , and Iris held faithfully to her promise of silence .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 20]: The girl 's ragged raiment , sou ` wester , and strong boots were already packed away on board .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 40]: She now rescued the Bible , the copy of Tennyson 's poems , the battered tin cup , her revolver , and the Lee-Metford which `` scared '' the Dyaks when they nearly caught Anstruther and Mir Jan napping .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 25]: Robert also gathered for her an assortment of Dyak hats , belts , and arms , including Taung S'Ali 's parang and a sumpitan .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 14]: These were her trophies , the _ spolia opima _ of the campaign .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 35]: His concluding act was to pack two of the empty oil tins with all the valuable lumps of auriferous quartz he could find where he shot the rubbish from the cave beneath the trees .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 30]: On top of these he placed some antimony ore , and Mir Jan , wondering why the sahib wanted the stuff , carried the consignment to the waiting boat .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 42]: Lieutenant Playdon , in command of the last party of sailors to quit the island , evidently expected Mir Jan to accompany them , but Anstruther explained that the man would await his return , some time in June or July .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 28]: Sir Arthur Deane found himself speculating on the cause of this extraordinary resolve , but , steadfast to his policy of avoiding controversial matters , said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 38]: A few words to the captain procured enough stores to keep the Mahommedan for six months at least , and whilst these were being landed , the question was raised how best to dispose of the Dyaks .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 11]: The commander wished to consult the convenience of his guests .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 30]: `` If we go a little out of our way and land them in Borneo , '' he said , `` they will be hanged without troubling you further .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 19]: If I take them to Singapore they will be tried on your evidence and sent to penal servitude .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 7]: Which is it to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 6]: It was Iris who decided .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 17]: `` I can not bear to think of more lives being sacrificed , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 27]: `` Perhaps if these men are treated mercifully and sent to their homes after some punishment their example may serve as a deterrent to others . ''
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 7]: So it was settled that way .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 18]: The anchor rattled up to its berth and the _ Orient _ turned her head towards Singapore .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 29]: As she steadily passed away into the deepening azure , the girl and her lover watched the familiar outlines of Rainbow Island growing dim in the evening light .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 25]: For a long while they could see Mir Jan 's tall , thin figure motionless on a rock at the extremity of Europa Point .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 23]: Their hut , the reef , the ledge , came into view as the cruiser swung round to a more northerly course .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 11]: Iris had thrown an arm across her father 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 16]: The three were left alone just then , and they were silent for many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 20]: At last , the flying miles merged the solitary palm beyond the lagoon with the foliage on the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 10]: The wide cleft of Prospect Park grew less distinct .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 12]: Mir Jan 's white-clothed figure was lost in the dark background .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 12]: The island was becoming vague , dream-like , a blurred memory .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 19]: `` Robert , '' said the girl devoutly , `` God has been very good to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 37]: `` I was thinking , even this instant , of the verse that is carved on the gate of the Memorial Well at Cawnpore : ` These are they which came out of great tribulation . '
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 19]: We , too , have come out of great tribulation , happily with our lives -- and more .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 9]: The decrees of fate are indeed inscrutable . ''
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 11]: Iris turned to him a face roseate with loving comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 9]: `` Do you remember this hour yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 32]: she murmured -- `` how we suffered from thirst -- how the Dyaks began their second attack from the ridge -- how you climbed down the ladder and I followed you ?
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 52]: Oh father , darling , '' she went on impulsively , tightening her grasp , `` you will never know how brave he was , how enduring , how he risked all for me and cheered me to the end , even though the end seemed to be the grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 27]: `` I think I am beginning to understand now , '' answered the shipowner , averting his eyes lest Iris should see the tears in them .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 21]: Their Calvary was ended , they thought -- was it for him to lead them again through the sorrowful way ?
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 18]: It was a heartrending task that lay before him , a task from which his soul revolted .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 7]: He refused even to attempt it .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 35]: He sought forgetfulness in a species of mental intoxication , and countenanced his daughter 's love idyll with such apparent approval that Lord Ventnor wondered whether Sir Arthur were not suffering from senile decay .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 11]: The explanation of the shipowner 's position was painfully simple .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 29]: Being a daring yet shrewd financier , he perceived in the troubled condition of the Far East a magnificent opportunity to consolidate the trading influence of his company .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 40]: He negotiated two big loans , one , of a semi-private nature , to equip docks and railways in the chief maritime province of China , the other of a more public character , with the Government of Japan .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 21]: All his own resources , together with those of his principal directors and shareholders , were devoted to these objects .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 24]: Contemporaneously , he determined to stop paying heavy insurance premiums on his fleet and make it self-supporting , on the well-known mutual principle .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 22]: His vessels were well equipped , well manned , replete with every modern improvement , and managed with great commercial skill .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 27]: In three or four years , given ordinary trading luck , he must have doubled his own fortune and earned a world-wide reputation for far-seeing sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 35]: No sooner were all his arrangements completed than three of his best ships went down , saddling his company with an absolute loss of nearly # 600,000 , and seriously undermining his financial credit .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 22]: A fellow-director , wealthy and influential , resigned his seat on the board , and headed a clique of disappointed stockholders .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 8]: At once the fair sky became overcast .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 13]: A sound and magnificent speculation threatened to dissolve in the Bankruptcy Court .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 36]: Sir Arthur Deane 's energy and financial skill might have enabled him to weather this unexpected gale were it not for the apparent loss of his beloved daughter with the crack ship of his line .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 35]: Half-frenzied with grief , he bade his enemies do their worst , and allowed his affairs to get into hopeless confusion whilst he devoted himself wholly to the search for Iris and her companions .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 11]: At this critical juncture Lord Ventnor again reached his side .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 11]: His lordship possessed a large private fortune and extensive estates .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 21]: He was prudent withal , and knew how admirably the shipowner 's plans would develop if given the necessary time .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 10]: He offered the use of his name and money .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 12]: He more than filled the gap created by the hostile ex-director .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 29]: People argued that such a clever man , just returning from the Far East after accomplishing a public mission of some importance , must be a reliable guide .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 16]: The mere cabled intelligence of his intention to join the board restored confidence and credit .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 7]: But -- there was a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 12]: If Iris lived , she must become the Countess of Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 8]: His lordship was weary of peripatetic love-making .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 27]: It was high time he settled down in life , took an interest in the legislature , and achieved a position in the world of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 6]: He had a chance now .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 33]: The certain success of his friend 's project , the fortunate completion of his own diplomatic undertaking , marriage with a beautiful and charming woman -- these items would consolidate his career .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 21]: If Iris were not available , plenty of women , high-placed in society , would accept such an eligible bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 8]: But his heart was set on Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 28]: She was honest , high-principled , pure in body and mind , and none prizes these essentials in a wife more than a worn-out _ roué _ .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 24]: He seized the first opportunity that presented itself to make Sir Arthur Deane acquainted with a decision already dreaded by the unfortunate shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 17]: Iris must either abandon her infatuation for Anstruther or bring about the ruin of her father .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 5]: There was no mean .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 34]: `` If she declines to become Countess of Ventnor , she can marry whom she likes , as you will be all paupers together , '' was the Earl 's caustic summing up .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 8]: This brutal argument rather overshot the mark .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 18]: The shipowner 's face flushed with anger , and Lord Ventnor hastened to retrieve a false step .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 24]: `` I did n't exactly mean to put it that way , Deane , but my temper is a little short these days .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 9]: My position on board this ship is intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 41]: As a matter of fair dealing to me , you should put a stop to your daughter 's attitude towards Anstruther , on the ground that her engagement is neither approved of by you nor desirable under any consideration . ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 23]: It may be assumed from this remark that even the Earl 's sardonic temper was ruffled by the girl 's outrageous behavior .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 23]: Nor was it exactly pleasant to him to note how steadily Anstruther advanced in the favor of every officer on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 19]: By tacit consent the court-martial was tabooed , at any rate until the _ Orient _ reached Singapore .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 37]: Every one knew that the quarrel lay between Robert and Ventnor , and it is not to be wondered at if Iris 's influence alone were sufficient to turn the scale in favor of her lover .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 13]: The shipowner refused point-blank to interfere in any way during the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 28]: `` You promised your co-operation in business even if we found that the _ Sirdar _ had gone down with all hands , '' he retorted bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 25]: `` Do you wish me to make my daughter believe she has come back into my life only to bring me irretrievable ruin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 19]: `` That appears to be the result , no matter how you may endeavor to disguise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 21]: `` I thought the days were gone when a man would wish to marry a woman against her will . ''
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 7]: What does she know about it ?
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 11]: The glamour of this island romance will soon wear off .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 14]: It would be different if Anstruther were able to maintain her even decently .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 10]: He is an absolute beggar , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 12]: Did n't he ship on your own vessel as a steward ?
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 6]: Take my tip , Deane .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 15]: Tell him how matters stand with you , and he will cool off . ''
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 31]: He believed nothing of the sort , but he was desperately anxious that Iris should learn the truth as to her father 's dilemma from other lips than his own .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 8]: This would be the first point gained .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 4]: Others would follow .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 11]: The two men were conversing in the Earl 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 12]: On the deck overhead a very different chat was taking place .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 11]: The _ Orient _ was due in Singapore that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 26]: Iris was invited into the chart-room on some pretext , and Lieutenant Playdon , delegated by the commander and the first lieutenant , buttonholed Robert .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 38]: With sailor-like directness he came straight to the point -- `` A few of us have been talking about you , Anstruther , and we can not be far wrong in assuming that you are hard up .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 26]: The fact that you took a steward 's job on the _ Sirdar _ shows your disinclination to appeal to your own people for funds .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 14]: Now , once you are ashore , you will be landed in difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 27]: To cut any further explanations , I am commissioned to offer you a loan of fifty pounds , which you can repay when you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 6]: Robert 's mouth tightened somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 9]: For the moment he could not find words .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 6]: Playdon feared he was offended .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 41]: `` I am sorry , old chap , if we are mistaken , '' he said hesitatingly ; `` but we really thought -- '' `` Please do not endeavor to explain away your generous act , '' exclaimed Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 11]: `` I accept it thankfully , on one condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 5]: `` Blow the condition .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 6]: But what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 18]: `` That you tell me the names of those to whom I am indebted besides yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 8]: `` Oh , that is easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 9]: Fitzroy and the first luff are the others .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 13]: We kept it to a small circle , do n't you know .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 7]: Thought you would prefer that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 7]: Anstruther smiled and wrung his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 12]: There were some good fellows left in the world after all .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 9]: The three officers acted in pure good nature .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 38]: They were assisting a man apparently down in his luck , who would soon be called on to face other difficulties by reason of his engagement to a girl apparently so far removed from him in station .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 64]: And the last thing they dreamed of was that their kindly loan was destined to yield them a better return than all the years of their naval service , for their fifty pounds had gone into the pocket of a potential millionaire , who was endowed with the faculty , rare in millionaires , of not forgetting the friends of his poverty-stricken days .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 36]: CHAPTER XVII RAINBOW ISLAND AGAIN -- AND AFTERWARD Sir Arthur Deane was sitting alone in his cabin in a state of deep dejection , when he was aroused by a knock , and Robert entered .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 10]: `` Can you give me half an hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 13]: `` I have something to say to you before we land . ''
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 9]: The shipowner silently motioned him to a seat .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 11]: `` It concerns Iris and myself , '' continued Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 27]: `` I gathered from your words when we met on the island that both you and Lord Ventnor regarded Iris as his lordship 's promised bride .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 34]: From your point of view the arrangement was perhaps natural and equitable , but since your daughter left Hong Kong it happens that she and I have fallen in love with each other .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 7]: No ; please listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 11]: I am not here to urge my claims on you .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 20]: I won her fairly and intend to keep her , were the whole House of Peers opposed to me .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 27]: At this moment I want to tell you , her father , why she could never , even under other circumstances , marry Lord Ventnor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 17]: Then he proceeded to place before the astounded baronet a detailed history of his recent career .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 13]: It was a sordid story of woman 's perfidy , twice told .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 7]: It carried conviction in every sentence .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 37]: It was possible , of course , to explain matters more fully to the baronet than to Iris , and Anstruther 's fierce resentment of the cruel wrong inflicted upon him blazed forth with overwhelming force .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 15]: The intensity of his wrath in no way impaired the cogency of his arguments .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 9]: Rather did it lend point and logical brevity .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 39]: Each word burned itself into his hearer 's consciousness , for Robert did not know that the unfortunate father was being coerced to a distasteful compact by the scoundrel who figured in the narrative as his evil genius .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 12]: At the conclusion Sir Arthur bowed his head between his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 14]: `` I can not choose but believe you , '' he admitted huskily .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 20]: `` Yet how came you to be so unjustly convicted by a tribunal composed of your brother officers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 7]: `` They could not help themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 37]: To acquit me meant that they discredited the sworn testimony not only of my Colonel 's wife , but of the civil head of an important Government Mission , not to mention some bought Chinese evidence .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 20]: Am I the first man to be offered up as a sacrifice on the altar of official expediency ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 7]: `` But you are powerless now .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 10]: You can hardly hope to have your case revised .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 13]: What chance is there that your name will ever be cleared ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 10]: `` Mrs. Costobell can do it if she will .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 13]: The vagaries of such a woman are not to be depended on .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 18]: If Lord Ventnor has cast her off , her hatred may ` prove stronger than her passion .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 15]: Anyhow , I should be the last man to despair of God 's Providence .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 19]: Compare the condition of Iris and myself today with our plight during the second night on the ledge !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 47]: I refuse to believe that a bad and fickle woman can resist the workings of destiny , and it was a happy fate which led me to ship on board the _ Sirdar _ , though at the time I saw it in another light . ''
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 13]: How different the words , the aspirations , of the two suitors .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 10]: Quite unconsciously , Robert could not have pleaded better .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 5]: The shipowner sighed heavily .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 9]: `` I hope your faith will be justified .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 33]: If it be not -- the more likely thing to happen -- do I understand that my daughter and you intend to get married whether I give or withhold my sanction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 7]: Anstruther rose and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 21]: `` I have ventured to tell you , '' he said , `` why she should not marry Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 37]: When I come to you and ask you for her , which I pray may be soon , it will be time enough to answer that question , should you then decide to put it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 40]: It must be remembered that Robert knew nothing whatever of the older man 's predicament , whilst the baronet , full of his own troubles , was in no mood to take a reasonable view of Anstruther 's position .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 54]: Neither Iris nor Robert could make him understand the long-drawn-out duel of their early life on the island , nor was it easy to depict the tumultuous agony of that terrible hour on the ledge when the girl forced the man to confess his love by suggesting acceptance of the Dyaks ' terms .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 37]: Thus , for a little while , these two were driven apart , and Anstruther disdained to urge the plea that not many weeks would elapse before he would be a richer man than his rival .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 8]: The chief sufferer was Sir Arthur Deane .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 40]: Had Iris guessed how her father was tormented , she would not have remained on the bridge , radiant and mirthful , whilst the grey-haired baronet gazed with stony-eyed despair at some memoranda which he extracted from his papers .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 6]: `` Ten thousand pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 22]: `` Not a great sum for the millionaire financier , Sir Arthur Deane , to raise on his note of hand .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 17]: A few months ago men offered me one hundred times the amount on no better security .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 41]: And now , to think that a set of jabbering fools in London should so destroy my credit and their own , that not a bank will discount our paper unless they are assured Lord Ventnor has joined the board !
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 21]: Fancy me , of all men , being willing to barter my child for a few pieces of gold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 5]: The thought was maddening .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 10]: For a little while he yielded to utter despondency .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 19]: It was quite true that a comparatively small amount of money would restore the stability of his firm .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 28]: Even without it , were his credit unimpaired , he could easily tide over the period of depression until the first fruits of his enterprise were garnered .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 11]: Then , all men would hail him as a genius .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 21]: Wearily turning over his papers , he suddenly came across the last letter written to him by Iris 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 8]: How she doted on their only child !
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 29]: He recalled one night , shortly before his wife died , when the little Iris was brought into her room to kiss her and lisp her infantile prayers .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 14]: She had devised a formula of her own -- `` God bless father !
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 4]: God bless mother !
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 9]: God bless me , their little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 12]: And what was it she cried to him from the beach ?
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 11]: `` Your own little girl given back to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 5]: Given back to him !
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 22]: For what -- to marry that black-hearted scoundrel whose pastime was the degradation of women and the defaming of honest men ?
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 4]: That settled it .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 9]: Instantly the cloud was lifted from his soul .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 7]: A great peace came upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 35]: The ruin of his business he might not be able to avert , but he would save from , the wreck that which he prized more than all else -- his daughter 's love .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 15]: The engines dropped to half speed -- they were entering the harbor of Singapore .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 10]: In a few hours the worst would be over .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 31]: If Ventnor telegraphed to London his withdrawal from the board , nothing short of a cabled draft for ten thousand pounds would prevent certain creditors from filing a bankruptcy petition .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 14]: In the local banks the baronet had about a thousand to his credit .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 28]: Surely among the rich merchants of the port , men who knew the potentialities of his scheme , he would be able to raise the money needed .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 5]: He would try hard .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 5]: Already he felt braver .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 9]: The old fire had returned to his blood .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 23]: The very belief that he was acting in the way best calculated to secure his daughter 's happiness stimulated and encouraged him .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 13]: He went on deck , to meet Iris skipping down the hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 8]: `` Oh , there you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 16]: `` I was just coming to find out why you were moping in your cabin .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 17]: You are missing the most beautiful view -- all greens , and blues , and browns !
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 4]: Run , quick !
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 11]: I want you to see every inch of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 13]: She held out her hand and pulled him gleefully up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 18]: Leaning against the taffrail , some distance apart from each other , were Anstruther and Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 11]: Need it be said to whom Iris drew her father ?
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 11]: `` Here he is , Robert , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 17]: `` I do believe he was sulking because Captain Fitzroy was so very attentive to me .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 10]: Yet you did n't mind it a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 9]: The two men looked into each other eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 3]: They smiled .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 11]: How could they resist the contagion of her sunny nature ?
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 22]: `` I have been thinking over what you said to me just now , Anstruther , '' said the shipowner slowly .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 3]: cried Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 12]: `` Have you two been talking secrets behind my back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 22]: `` It is no secret to you -- my little girl -- '' Her father 's voice lingered on the phrase .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 18]: `` When we are on shore , Robert , I will explain matters to you more fully .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 23]: Just now I wish only to tell you that where Iris has given her heart I will not refuse her hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 6]: `` You darling old dad !
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 11]: And is that what all the mystery was about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 11]: She took his face between her hands and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 11]: Lord Ventnor , wondering at this effusiveness , strolled forward .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 9]: `` What has happened , Miss Deane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 13]: `` Have you just discovered what an excellent parent you possess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 8]: The baronet laughed , almost hysterically . ''
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 21]: ` Pon my honor , '' he cried , `` you could not have hit upon a happier explanation . ''
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 7]: His lordship was not quite satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 13]: `` I suppose you will take Iris to Smith 's Hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 6]: he said with cool impudence .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 4]: Iris answered him .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 17]: My father has just asked Robert to come with us -- by inference , that is .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 6]: Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 16]: The adroit use of her lover 's Christian name goaded his lordship to sudden heat .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 3]: he snarled .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 17]: `` Sir Arthur Deane has evidently decided a good many things during the last hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' was the shipowner 's quiet retort .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 19]: `` I have decided that my daughter 's happiness should be the chief consideration of my remaining years .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 9]: All else must give way to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 10]: The Earl 's swarthy face grew sallow with fury .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 27]: His eyes blazed , and there was a tense vibrato in his voice as he said -- `` Then I must congratulate you , Miss Deane .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 7]: You are fated to endure adventures .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 21]: Having escaped from the melodramatic perils of Rainbow Island you are destined to experience another variety of shipwreck here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 4]: He left them .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 11]: Not a word had Robert spoken throughout the unexpected scene .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 19]: His heart was throbbing with a tremulous joy , and his lordship 's sneers were lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 15]: But he could not fail to note the malignant purpose of the parting sentence .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 15]: In his quietly masterful way he placed his hand on the baronet 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 8]: `` What did Lord Ventnor mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 21]: Sir Arthur Deane answered , with a calm smile -- `` It is difficult to talk openly at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 8]: Wait until we reach the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 24]: The news flew fast through the settlement that H.M.S. _ Orient _ had returned from her long search for the _ Sirdar _ .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 18]: The warship occupied her usual anchorage , and a boat was lowered to take off the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 7]: Lieutenant Playdon went ashore with them .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 15]: A feeling of consideration for Anstruther prevented any arrangements being made for subsequent meetings .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 23]: Once their courteous duty was ended , the officers of the _ Orient _ could not give him any further social recognition .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 15]: Lord Ventnor was aware of this fact and endeavored to turn it to advantage .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 44]: `` By the way , Fitzroy , '' he called out to the commander as he prepared to descend the gangway , `` I want you , and any others not detained by duty , to come and dine with me tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 37]: Captain Fitzroy answered blandly -- `` It is very good of you to ask us , but I fear I can not make any definite arrangements until I learn what orders are awaiting me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 8]: Come if you can , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 11]: `` Yes ; suppose we leave it at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 8]: It was a polite but decided rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 35]: It in no way tended to sweeten Lord Ventnor 's temper , which was further exasperated when he hurt his shin against one of Robert 's disreputable-looking tins , with its accumulation of debris .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 8]: The boat swung off into the tideway .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 17]: Her progress shorewards was watched by a small knot of people , mostly loungers and coolies .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 26]: Among them , however , were two persons who had driven rapidly to the landing-place when the arrival of the _ Orient _ was reported .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 22]: One bore all the distinguishing marks of the army officer of high rank , but the other was unmistakably a globetrotter .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 49]: Only in Piccadilly could he have purchased his wondrous _ sola topi _ , or pith helmet -- with its imitation _ puggri _ neatly frilled and puckered -- and no tailor who ever carried his goose through the Exile 's Gate would have fashioned his expensive garments .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 18]: But the old gentleman made no pretence that he could `` hear the East a-callin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 14]: He swore impartially at the climate , the place , and its inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 12]: At this instant he was in a state of wild excitement .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 11]: He was very tall , very stout , exceedingly red-faced .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 12]: Any budding medico who understood the pre-eminence enjoyed by _ aq .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 17]: ad _ in a prescription , would have diagnosed him as a first-rate subject for apoplexy .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 19]: Producing a tremendous telescope , he vainly endeavored to balance it on the shoulder of a native servant .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 12]: `` Ca n't you stand still , you blithering idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 26]: he shouted , after futile attempts to focus the advancing boat , `` or shall I steady you by a clout over the ear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 15]: His companion , the army man , was looking through a pair of field-glasses .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 20]: he cried , `` I can see Sir Arthur Deane , and a girl who looks like his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 11]: There 's that infernal scamp , Ventnor , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 22]: The big man brushed the servant out of his way , and brandished the telescope as though it were a bludgeon .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 5]: `` The dirty beggar !
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 18]: He drove my lad to misery and death , yet he has come back safe and sound .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 6]: Wait till I meet him .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 9]: I 'll -- '' `` Now , Anstruther !
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 4]: Remember your promise .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 7]: I will deal with Lord Ventnor .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 6]: My vengeance has first claim .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 11]: By the jumping Moses , I do believe -- Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 2]: Anstruther !
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 10]: Your nephew is sitting next to the girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 10]: The telescope fell on the stones with a crash .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 8]: The giant 's rubicund face suddenly blanched .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 8]: He leaned on his friend for support .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 11]: `` You are not mistaken , '' he almost whimpered .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 11]: `` Look again , for God 's sake , man .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 6]: Make sure before you speak .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 3]: Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 4]: Tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 6]: `` Calm yourself , Anstruther .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 11]: It is Robert , as sure as I 'm alive .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 29]: Do n't you think I know him , my poor disgraced friend , whom I , like all the rest , cast off in his hour of trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 6]: But I had some excuse .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 9]: I did n't mean that , old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 13]: Robert himself will be the last man to blame either of us .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 16]: Who could have suspected that two people -- one of them , God help me !
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 11]: my wife -- would concoct such a hellish plot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 21]: The boat glided gracefully alongside the steps of the quay , and Playdon sprang ashore to help Iris to alight .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 26]: What happened immediately afterwards can best be told in his own words , as he retailed the story to an appreciative audience in the ward-room .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 41]: `` We had just landed , '' he said , `` and some of the crew were pushing the coolies out of the way , when two men jumped down the steps , and a most fiendish row sprang up .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 53]: That is , there was no dispute or wrangling , but one chap , who , it turned out , was Colonel Costobell , grabbed Ventnor by the shirt front , and threatened to smash his face in if he did n't listen then and there to what he had to say .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 15]: I really thought about interfering , until I heard Colonel Costobell 's opening words .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 14]: After that I would gladly have seen the beggar chucked into the harbor .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 9]: We never liked him , did we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 20]: `` Ask no questions , Pompey , but go ahead with the yarn , '' growled the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 11]: `` Well , it seems that Mrs. Costobell is dead .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 20]: She got enteric a week after the _ Orient _ sailed , and was a goner in four days .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 8]: Before she died she owned up . ''
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 10]: He paused , with a base eye to effect .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 7]: Not a man moved a muscle .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 8]: `` All right , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 9]: `` I will make no more false starts .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 31]: Mrs. Costobell begged her husband 's forgiveness for her treatment of him , and confessed that she and Lord Ventnor planned the affair for which Anstruther was tried by court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 22]: It must have been a beastly business , for Costobell was sweating with rage , though his words were icy enough .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 36]: And you ought to have seen Ventnor 's face when he heard of the depositions , sworn to and signed by Mrs. Costobell and by several Chinese servants whom he bribed to give false evidence .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 31]: He promised to marry Mrs. Costobell if her husband died , or , in any event , to bring about a divorce when the Hong Kong affair had blown over .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 22]: Then she learnt that he was after Miss Iris , and there is no doubt her fury helped on the fever .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 49]: Costobell said that , for his wife 's sake , he would have kept the wretched thing secret , but he was compelled to clear Anstruther 's name , especially as he came across the other old Johnnie -- '' `` Pompey , you are incoherent with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 10]: Who is ` the other old Johnnie ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 6]: asked the first luff severely .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 7]: `` Did n't I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 23]: Why , Anstruther 's uncle , of course , a heavy old swell with just a touch of Yorkshire in his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 16]: I gathered that he disinherited his nephew when the news of the court-martial reached him .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 9]: Then he relented , and cabled to him .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 12]: Getting no news , he came East to look for him .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 44]: He met Costobell the day after the lady died , and the two swore -- the stout uncle can swear a treat -- anyhow , they vowed to be revenged on Ventnor , and to clear Anstruther 's character , living or dead .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 4]: Poor old chap !
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 14]: He cried like a baby when he asked the youngster to forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 5]: It was quite touching .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 14]: I can tell you -- '' Playdon affected to search for his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 18]: `` Do tell us , or it will be worse for you , '' cried his mentor .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 10]: `` Give me time , air , a drink !
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 8]: What you fellows want is a phonograph .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 21]: Well , Costobell shook Ventnor off at last , with the final observation that Anstruther 's court-martial has been quashed .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 35]: The next batch of general orders will re-instate him in the regiment , and it rests with him to decide whether or not a criminal warrant shall be issued against his lordship for conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 9]: Do you fellows know what conspir -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 4]: `` You cuckoo !
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 7]: What did Miss Deane do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 19]: `` Clung to Anstruther like a weeping angel , and kissed everybody all round when Ventnor got away .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 5]: Well -- hands off .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 11]: I mean her father , Anstruther and the stout uncle .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 9]: Unfortunately I was not on in that scene .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 37]: But , for some reason , they all nearly wrung my arm off , and the men were so excited that they gave the party a rousing cheer as their rickshaws went off in a bunch .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 10]: Will no Christian gentleman get me a drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 41]: The next commotion arose in the hotel when Sir Arthur Deane seized the first opportunity to explain the predicament in which his company was placed , and the blow which Lord Ventnor yet had it in his power to deal .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 8]: Mr. William Anstruther was an interested auditor .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 11]: Robert would have spoken , but his uncle restrained him .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 12]: `` Leave this to me , lad , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 45]: `` When I was coming here in the _ Sirdar _ there was a lot of talk about Sir Arthur 's scheme , and there should not be much difficulty in raising all the brass required , if half what I heard be true .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 15]: Sit you down , Sir Arthur , and tell us all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 7]: The shipowner required no second bidding .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 87]: With the skill for which he was noted , he described his operations in detail , telling how every farthing of the first instalments of the two great loans was paid up , how the earnings of his fleet would quickly overtake the deficit in capital value caused by the loss of the three ships , and how , in six months ' time , the leading financial houses of London , Paris , and Berlin would be offering him more money than he would need .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 34]: To a shrewd man of business the project could not fail to commend itself , and the Yorkshire squire , though a trifle obstinate in temper , was singularly clear-headed in other respects .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 13]: He brought his great fist down on the table with a whack .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 32]: `` Send a cable to your company , Sir Arthur , '' he cried , `` and tell them that your prospective son-in-law will provide the ten thousand pounds you require .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 9]: I will see that his draft is honored .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 22]: You can add , if you like , that another ten will be ready if wanted when this lot is spent .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 16]: I did my lad one d -- er -- deuced bad turn in my life .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 15]: This time , I think , I am doing him a good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 13]: `` You are , indeed , '' said Iris 's father enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 21]: `` The unallotted capital he is taking up will be worth four times its face value in two years . ''
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 19]: `` All the more reason to make his holding twenty instead of ten , '' roared the Yorkshireman .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 5]: `` But look here .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 14]: You talk about dropping proceedings against that precious earl whom I saw to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 21]: Why not tell him not to try any funny tricks until Robert 's money is safely lodged to your account ?
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 7]: We have him in our power .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 12]: Dash it all , let us use him a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 8]: Even Iris laughed at this naive suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 39]: It was delightful to think that their arch enemy was actually helping the baronet 's affairs at that very moment , and would continue to do so until he was flung aside as being of no further value .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 34]: Although Ventnor himself had carefully avoided any formal commitment , the cablegrams awaiting the shipowner at Singapore showed that confidence had already been restored by the uncontradicted use of his lordship 's name .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 7]: Robert at last obtained a hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 20]: `` You two are quietly assuming the attitude of the financial magnates of this gathering , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 28]: `` I must admit that you have managed things very well between you , and I do not propose for one moment to interfere with your arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 13]: Nevertheless , Iris and I are really the chief moneyed persons present .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 22]: You spoke of financial houses in England and on the Continent backing up your loans six months hence , Sir Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 7]: You need not go to them .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 7]: We will be your bankers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 23]: The baronet laughed with a whole-hearted gaiety that revealed whence Iris got some part , at least , of her bright disposition .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 10]: `` Will you sell your island , Robert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 17]: `` I am afraid that not even Iris could wheedle any one into buying it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 19]: `` But father , dear , '' interrupted the girl earnestly , `` what Robert says is true .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 7]: We have a gold mine there .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 14]: It is worth so much that you will hardly believe it until then ?
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 10]: can no longer be any doubt in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 18]: I suppose that is why Robert asked me not to mention his discovery to you earlier . ''
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 36]: `` No , Iris , that was not the reason , '' said her lover , and the older men felt that more than idle fancy inspired the astounding intelligence that they had just heard .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 15]: `` Your love was more to me than all the gold in the world .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 5]: I had won you .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 14]: I meant to keep you , but I refused to buy you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 6]: He turned to her father .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 19]: His pent-up emotion mastered him , and he spoke as one who could no longer restrain his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 22]: `` I have had no chance to thank you for the words you uttered at the moment we quitted the ship .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 9]: Yet I will treasure them while life lasts .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 21]: You gave Iris to me when I was poor , disgraced , an outcast from my family and my profession .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 9]: And I know why you did this thing .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 13]: It was because you valued her happiness more than riches or reputation .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 11]: I am sorry now I did not explain matters earlier .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 9]: It would have saved you much needless suffering .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 31]: But the sorrow has sped like an evil dream , and you will perhaps not regret it , for your action today binds me to you with hoops of steel .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 7]: And you , too , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 14]: You traveled thousands of miles to help and comfort me in my anguish .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 31]: Were I as bad as I was painted , your kind old heart still pitied me ; you were prepared to pluck me from the depths of despair and degradation .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 7]: Why should I hate Lord Ventnor ?
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 10]: What man could have served me as he did ?
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 6]: He has given me Iris .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 21]: He gained for me at her father 's hands a concession such as mortal has seldom wrested from black-browed fate .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 14]: He brought my uncle to my side in the hour of my adversity .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 3]: Hate him !
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 50]: I would have his statue carved in marble , and set on high to tell all who passed how good may spring out of evil -- how God 's wisdom can manifest itself by putting even the creeping and crawling things of the earth to some useful purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 18]: `` Dash it all , lad , '' vociferated the elder Anstruther , `` what ails thee ?
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 10]: I never heard you talk like this before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 17]: The old gentleman 's amazement was so comical that further tension was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 19]: Robert , in calmer mood , informed them of the manner in which he hit upon the mine .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 38]: The story sounded like wildest romance -- this finding of a volcanic dyke guarded by the bones of `` J.S. '' and the poison-filled quarry -- but the production of the ore samples changed wonder into certainty .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 36]: Next day a government metallurgist estimated the value of the contents of the two oil-tins at about # 500 , yet the specimens brought from the island were not by any means the richest available .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 16]: And now there is not much more to tell of Rainbow Island and its castaways .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 57]: On the day that Captain Robert Anstruther 's name appeared in the _ Gazette _ , reinstating him to his rank and regiment , Iris and he were married in the English Church at Hong Kong , for it was his wife 's wish that the place which witnessed his ignominy should also witness his triumph .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 29]: A good-natured admiral decided that the urgent requirements of the British Navy should bring H.M.S. _ Orient _ to the island before the date fixed for the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 38]: Lieutenant Playdon officiated as best man , whilst the _ Orient _ was left so scandalously short-handed for many hours that a hostile vessel , at least twice her size , might have ventured to attack her .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 8]: Soon afterwards , Robert resigned his commission .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 19]: He regretted the necessity , but the demands of his new sphere in life rendered this step imperative .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 49]: Mining engineers , laborers , stores , portable houses , engines , and equipment were obtained with all haste , and the whole party sailed on one of Sir Arthur Deane 's ships to convoy a small steamer specially hired to attend to the wants of the miners .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 42]: At last , one evening , early in July , the two vessels anchored outside Palm-tree Rock , and Mir Jan could be seen running frantically about the shore , for no valid reason save that he could not stand still .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 7]: The sahib brought him good news .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 19]: The Governor of Hong Kong felt that any reasonable request made by Anstruther should be granted if possible .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 57]: He had written such a strong representation of the Mahommedan 's case to the Government of India that there was little doubt the returning mail would convey an official notification that Mir Jan , formerly _ naik _ in the Kumaon Rissala -- he who once killed a man -- had been granted a free pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 18]: The mining experts verified Robert 's most sanguine views after a very brief examination of the deposit .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 7]: Hardly any preliminary work was needed .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 24]: In twenty-four hours a small concentrating plant was erected , and a ditch made to drain off the carbonic anhydride in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 14]: After dusk a party of coolies cleared the quarry of its former occupants .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 40]: Towards the close of the following day , when the great steamer once more slowly turned her head to the north-west , Iris could hear the steady thud of an engine at work on the first consignment of ore .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 10]: Robert had been busy up to the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 14]: There was so much to be done in a short space of time .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 36]: The vessel carried a large number of passengers , and he did not wish to detain them too long , though they one and all expressed their willingness to suit his convenience in this respect .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 10]: Now his share of the necessary preparations was concluded .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 48]: His wife , Sir Arthur and his uncle were gathered in a corner of the promenade deck when he approached and told them that his last instruction ashore was for a light to be fixed on Summit Rock as soon as the dynamo was in working order .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 39]: `` When we all come back in the cold weather , '' he explained gleefully , `` we will not imitate the _ Sirdar _ by running on to the reef , should we arrive by night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 4]: Iris answered not .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 10]: Her blue eyes were fixed on the fast-receding cliffs .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 16]: `` Sweetheart , '' said her husband , `` why are you so silent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 5]: She turned to him .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 7]: The light of the setting sun !
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 8]: illumined her face with its golden radiance .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 11]: `` Because I am so happy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 13]: `` Oh , Robert , dear , so happy and thankful . ''
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 40]: * * * * * POSTSCRIPT The latest news of Col. and Mrs. Anstruther is contained in a letter written by an elderly maiden lady , resident in the North Riding of Yorkshire , to a friend in London .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 12]: It is dated some four years after the events already recorded .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 38]: Although its information is garbled and , to a certain extent , inaccurate , those who have followed the adventures of the young couple under discussion will be able to appreciate its opinions at their true value .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 27]: When the writer states facts , of course , her veracity is unquestionable , but occasionally she flounders badly when she depends upon her own judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 40]: Here is the letter : `` MY DEAR HELEN : `` I have not seen or heard of you during so long a time that I am _ simply dying _ to tell you all that is happening here .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 20]: You will remember that some people named Anstruther bought the Fairlawn estate near our village some three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 12]: They are , as you know , _ enormously _ rich .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 41]: The doctor tells me that when they are not squeezing money out of the wretched Chinese , they dig it in _ barrow-loads _ out of some magic island in the Atlantic or the Pacific -- I really forget which .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 16]: `` Anyhow , they could afford to _ entertain _ much more than they do .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 35]: Mrs. Anstruther is very nice looking , and could be a leader of society if she chose , but she _ seems _ to care for no one but her husband and her babies .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 23]: She has a boy and a girl , very charming children , I admit , and you seldom see her without them .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 48]: They have a French _ bonne _ apiece , and a most _ murderous _ - looking person -- a Mahommedan native , I believe -- stalks alongside and behaves as if he would _ instantly decapitate _ any person who as much as looked at them .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 7]: Such a procession you never saw !
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 13]: Mrs. Anstruther 's devotion to her husband is _ too _ absurd .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 31]: He is a tall , handsome man , of distinguished appearance , but on the few occasions I have spoken to him he impressed me as somewhat _ taciturn _ .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 28]: Yet to see the way in which his wife even _ looks _ at him you would imagine that he had not his equal in the world !
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 13]: `` I believe there is some _ secret _ in their lives .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 45]: Colonel Anstruther used to be in the army -- he is now in command of our local yeomanry -- and although his name is ` Robert , ' _ tout court _ , I have often heard Mrs. Anstruther call him ` Jenks . '
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 14]: Their boy , too , is christened Robert _ Jenks _ Anstruther . '
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 17]: Now , my dear Helen , _ do _ make inquiries about them in town circles .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 22]: I _ particularly _ wish you to find out who is this person ` Jenks ' -- a most vulgar name .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 32]: I am sure you will unearth something curious , because Mrs. Anstruther was a Miss Deane , daughter of the baronet , and Anstruther 's people are well known in Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 12]: There are absolutely no Jenkses connected with them on either side .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 28]: `` I think I can help you by another _ clue _ , as a very _ odd _ incident occurred at our hunt ball last week .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 24]: The Anstruthers , I must tell you , usually go away for the winter , to China , or to their fabulous island .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 34]: This year they remained at home , and Colonel Anstruther became M.F.H. , as he is certainly a most liberal man so far as _ sport _ and _ charity _ are concerned .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 34]: `` Well , dear , the Dodgsons -- you remember the Leeds clothier people -- having _ contrived _ to enter county society , invited the Earl of Ventnor down for the ball .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 21]: He , it seems , knew nothing about Anstruther being M.F.H. , and of course Mrs. Anstruther _ received _ .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 12]: The moment Lord Ventnor heard her name he was very angry .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 19]: He said he did not care to meet her , and left for London by the next train .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 26]: The Dodgsons were _ awfully _ annoyed with him , and Mrs. Dodgson had the bad taste to tell Mrs , Anstruther all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 20]: And what do you think _ she _ said -- ` Lord Ventnor need not have been so frightened .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 11]: My husband has not brought his hunting-crop with him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 24]: `` I was not there , but young Barker told me that Mrs. Anstruther looked very _ impressive _ as she said this .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 4]: ` Stunning ! '
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 27]: was the word he used , but young Barker is a _ fool _ , and thinks Mrs. A. is the most beautiful woman in Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 30]: Her dress , they say , was _ magnificent _ , which I can hardly credit , as she usually goes about in the _ plainest _ tailor-made clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 4]: By the way .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 13]: I forgot to mention that the Anstruthers have restored our parish church .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 11]: The vicar , of course , is enraptured with them .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 17]: I dislike people who are so free with their money and yet reserved in their friendship .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 26]: It is a sure sign , when they _ court _ popularity , that they dread something leaking out about the _ past _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 6]: _ Do _ write soon .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 21]: Do n't forget ` Jenks ' and ` Lord Ventnor ' ; those are the lines of _ inquiry _ .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 6]: `` Yours , `` MATILDA .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 3]: `` PS .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 7]: -- Perhaps I am misjudging them .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 17]: Mrs. Anstruther has just sent me an invitation to an ` At Home ' next Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 5]: -- M. `` PPS .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 28]: -- Dear me , this letter will never get away , I have just destroyed another envelope to tell you that the vicar came in to tea .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 21]: From what he told me about Lord Ventnor , I imagine that Mrs. Anstruther said no more than he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 5]: -- M. '' NOTE .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 47]: -- Colonel Anstruther 's agents discovered , after long and costly inquiry , that a Shields man named James Spence , a marine engineer , having worked for a time as a miner in California , shipped as third engineer on a vessel bound for Shanghai .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 5]: There be quitted her .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 33]: He passed some time ashore in dissipation , took another job on a Chinese river steamer , and was last heard of some eighteen months before the _ Sirdar _ was wrecked .
