Parsing [sent. 28 len. 6]: THE HISTORY OF GUTTA-PERCHA WILLIE .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 10]: CHAPTER I. WHO HE WAS AND WHERE HE WAS .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 58]: When he had been at school for about three weeks , the boys called him Six-fingered Jack ; but his real name was Willie , for his father and mother gave it him -- not William , but Willie , after a brother of his father , who died young , and had always been called Willie .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 8]: His name in full was Willie Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 44]: It was generally pronounced Macmickle , which was , by a learned anthropologist , for certain reasons about to appear in this history , supposed to have been the original form of the name , dignified in the course of time into Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 29]: It was his own father , however , who gave him the name of Gutta-Percha Willie , the reason of which will also show itself by and by .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 100]: Mr Macmichael was a country doctor , living in a small village in a thinly-peopled country ; the first result of which was that he had very hard work , for he had often to ride many miles to see a patient , and that not unfrequently in the middle of the night ; and the second that , for this hard work , he had very little pay , for a thinly-peopled country is generally a poor country , and those who live in it are poor also , and can not spend much even upon their health .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 86]: But the doctor not only preferred a country life , although he would have been glad to have richer patients , and within less distances of each other , but he would say to any one who expressed surprise that , with his reputation , he should remain where he was -- `` What 's to become of my little flock if I go away , for there are very few doctors of my experience who would feel inclined to come and undertake my work .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 22]: I know every man , woman , and child in the whole country-side , and that makes all the difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 38]: You see , therefore , that he was a good kind-hearted man , and loved his work , for the sake of those whom he helped by it , better than the money he received for it .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 27]: Their home was necessarily a very humble one -- a neat little cottage in the village of Priory Leas -- almost the one pretty spot thereabout .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 34]: It lay in a valley in the midst of hills , which did not look high , because they rose with a gentle slope , and had no bold elevations or grand-shaped peaks .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 41]: But they rose to a good height notwithstanding , and the weather on the top of them in the wintertime was often bitter and fierce -- bitter with keen frost , and fierce with as wild winds as ever blew .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 64]: Of both frost and wind the village at their feet had its share too , but of course they were not so bad down below , for the hills were a shelter from the wind , and it is always colder the farther you go up and away from the heart of this warm ball of rock and earth upon which we live .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 96]: When Willie 's father was riding across the great moorland of those desolate hills , and the people in the village would be saying to each other how bitterly cold it was , he would be thinking how snug and warm it was down there , and how nice it would be to turn a certain corner on the road back , and slip at once out of the freezing wind that had it all its own way up among the withered gorse and heather of the wide expanse where he pursued his dreary journey .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 20]: For his part , Willie cared very little what the weather was , but took it as it came .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 29]: In the hot summer , he would lie in the long grass and get cool ; in the cold winter , he would scamper about and get warm .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 17]: When his hands were as cold as icicles , his cheeks would be red as apples .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 52]: When his mother took his hands in hers , and chafed them , full of pity for their suffering , as she thought it , Willie first knew that they were cold by the sweet warmth of the kind hands that chafed them : he had not thought of it before .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 83]: Climbing amongst the ruins of the Priory , or playing with Farmer Thomson 's boys and girls about the ricks in his yard , in the thin clear saffron twilight which came so early after noon , when , to some people , every breath seemed full of needle-points , so sharp was the cold , he was as comfortable and happy as if he had been a creature of the winter only , and found himself quite at home in it .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 17]: For there were ruins , and pretty large ruins too , which they called the Priory .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 23]: It was not often that monks chose such a poor country to settle in , but I suppose they had their reasons .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 57]: And I dare say they were not monks at all , but begging friars , who founded it when they wanted to reprove the luxury and greed of the monks ; and perhaps by the time they had grown as bad themselves , the place was nearly finished , and they could not well move it .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 63]: They had , however , as I have indicated , chosen the one pretty spot , around which , for a short distance on every side , the land was tolerably good , and grew excellent oats if poor wheat , while the gardens were equal to apples and a few pears , besides abundance of gooseberries , currants , and strawberries .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 66]: The ruins of the Priory lay behind Mr Macmichael 's cottage -- indeed , in the very garden -- of which , along with the house , he had purchased the fen -- that is , the place was his own , so long as he paid a small sum -- not more than fifteen shillings a year , I think -- to his superior .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 59]: How long it was since the Priory had come to be looked upon as the mere encumbrance of a cottage garden , nobody thereabouts knew ; and although by this time I presume archaeologists have ferreted out everything concerning it , nobody except its owner had then taken the trouble to make the least inquiry into its history .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 39]: To Willie it was just the Priory , as naturally in his father 's garden as if every garden had similar ruins to adorn or encumber it , according as the owner might choose to regard its presence .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 35]: The ruins were of considerable extent , with remains of Gothic arches , and carvings about the doors -- all open to the sky except a few places on the ground-level which were vaulted .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 32]: These being still perfectly solid , were used by the family as outhouses to store wood and peats , to keep the garden tools in , and for such like purposes .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 22]: In summer , golden flowers grew on the broken walls ; in winter , grey frosts edged them against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: I fancy the whole garden was but the space once occupied by the huge building , for its surface was the most irregular I ever saw in a garden .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 29]: It was up and down , up and down , in whatever direction you went , mounded with heaps of ruins , over which the mould had gathered .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 33]: For many years bushes and flowers had grown upon them , and you might dig a good way without coming to the stones , though come to them you must at last .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 38]: The walks wound about between the heaps , and through the thick walls of the ruin , overgrown with lichens and mosses , now and then passing through an arched door or window of the ancient building .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 11]: It was a generous garden in old-fashioned flowers and vegetables .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 75]: There were a few apple and pear trees also on a wall that faced the south , which were regarded by Willie with mingled respect and desire , for he was not allowed to touch them , while of the gooseberries he was allowed to eat as many as he pleased when they were ripe , and of the currants too , after his mother had had as many as she wanted for preserves .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 25]: Some spots were much too shady to allow either fruit or flowers to grow in them , so high and close were the walls .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 45]: But I need not say more about the garden now , for I shall have occasion to refer to it again and again , and I must not tell all I know at once , else how should I make a story of it ?
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 4]: WILLIE 'S EDUCATION .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 19]: Willie was a good deal more than nine years of age before he could read a single word .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 49]: It was not that he was stupid , as we shall soon see , but that he had not learned the good of reading , and therefore had not begun to wish to read ; and his father had unusual ideas about how he ought to be educated .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 31]: He said he would no more think of making Willie learn to read before he wished to be taught than he would make him eat if he was n't hungry .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 30]: The gift of reading , he said , was too good a thing to give him before he wished to have it , or knew the value of it .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 40]: `` Would you give him a watch , '' he would say , `` before he cares to know whether the sun rises in the east or the west , or at what hour dinner will be ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 16]: Now I am not very sure how this would work with some boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 37]: I am afraid they might never learn to read until they had boys and girls of their own whom they wanted to be better off than , because of their ignorance , they had been themselves .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 16]: But it worked well in Willie 's case , who was neither lazy nor idle .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 16]: And it must not be supposed that he was left without any education at all .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 45]: For one thing , his father and mother used to talk very freely before him -- much more so than most parents do in the presence of their children ; and nothing serves better for teaching than the conversation of good and thoughtful people .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 61]: While they talked , Willie would sit listening intently , trying to understand what he heard ; and although it not unfrequently took very strange shapes in his little mind , because at times he understood neither the words nor the things the words represented , yet there was much that he did understand and make a good use of .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 35]: For instance , he soon came to know that his father and mother had very little money to spare , and that his father had to work hard to get what money they had .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 33]: He learned also that everything that came into the house , or was done for them , cost money ; therefore , for one thing , he must not ill-use his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 75]: He learned , too , that there was a great deal of suffering in the world , and that his father 's business was to try to make it less , and help people who were ill to grow well again , and be able to do their work ; and this made him see what a useful man his father was , and wish to be also of some good in the world .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 59]: Then he looked about him and saw that there were a great many ways of getting money , that is , a great many things for doing which people would give money ; and he saw that some of those ways were better than others , and he thought his father 's way the very best of all .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 22]: I give these as specimens of the lessons he learned by listening to his father and mother as they talked together .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: But he had another teacher .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 65]: Down the street of the village , which was very straggling , with nearly as many little gardens as houses in it , there was a house occupied by several poor people , in one end of which , consisting just of a room and a closet , an old woman lived who got her money by spinning flax into yarn for making linen .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 21]: She was a kind-hearted old creature -- widow , without any relation near to help her or look after her .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 16]: She had had one child , who died before he was as old as Willie .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 31]: That was forty years before , but she had never forgotten her little Willie , for that was his name too , and she fancied our Willie was like him .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 21]: Nothing , therefore , pleased her better than to get him into her little room , and talk to him .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 56]: She would take a little bit of sugar-candy or liquorice out of her cupboard for him , and tell him some strange old fairy tale or legend , while she sat spinning , until at last she had made him so fond of her that he would often go and stay for hours with her .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 47]: Nor did it make much difference when his mother begged Mrs Wilson to give him something sweet only now and then , for she was afraid of his going to see the old woman merely for what she gave him , which would have been greedy .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 62]: But the fact was , he liked her stories better than her sugar-candy and liquorice ; while above all things he delighted in watching the wonderful wheel go round and round so fast that he could not find out whether her foot was making it spin , or it was making her foot dance up and down in that curious way .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 89]: After she had explained it to him as well as she could , and he thought he understood it , it seemed to him only the more wonderful and mysterious ; and ever as it went whirring round , it sung a song of its own , which was also the song of the story , whatever it was , that the old woman was telling him , as he sat listening in her high soft chair , covered with long-faded chintz , and cushioned like a nest .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 77]: For Mrs Wilson had had a better house to live in once , and this chair , as well as the chest of drawers of dark mahogany , with brass handles , that stood opposite the window , was part of the furniture she saved when she had to sell the rest ; and well it was , she used to say , for her old rheumatic bones that she had saved the chair at least .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 59]: In that chair , then , the little boy would sit coiled up as nearly into a ball as might be , like a young bird or a rabbit in its nest , staring at the wheel , and listening with two ears and one heart to its song and the old woman 's tale both at once .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 18]: -LSB- Illustration : `` WILLIE LIKED MRS WILSON 'S STORIES BETTER THAN HER SUGAR CANDY . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 86]: One sultry summer afternoon , his mother not being very well and having gone to lie down , his father being out , as he so often was , upon Scramble the old horse , and Tibby , their only servant , being busy with the ironing , Willie ran off to Widow Wilson 's , and was soon curled up in the chair , like a little Hindoo idol that had grown weary of sitting upright , and had tumbled itself into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 109]: Now , before he came , the old woman had been thinking about him , and wishing very much that he would come ; turning over also in her mind , as she spun , all her stock of stories , in the hope of finding in some nook or other one she had not yet told him ; for although he had not yet begun to grow tired even of those he knew best , it was a special treat to have a new one ; for by this time Mrs Wilson 's store was all but exhausted , and a new one turned up very rarely .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 23]: This time , however , she was successful , and did call to mind one that she had not thought of before .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 55]: It had not only grown very dusty , but was full of little holes , which she at once set about darning up with the needle and thread of her imagination , so that , by the time Willie arrived , she had a treat , as she thought , quite ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 54]: I am not going to tell you the story , which was about a poor boy who received from a fairy to whom he had shown some kindness the gift of a marvelous wand , in the shape of a common blackthorn walking-stick , which nobody could suspect of possessing such wonderful virtue .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 72]: By means of it , he was able to do anything he wished , without the least trouble ; and so , upon a trial of skill , appointed by a certain king , in order to find out which of the craftsmen of his realm was fittest to aid him in ruling it , he found it easy to surpass every one of them , each in his own trade .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 148]: He produced a richer damask than any of the silk-weavers ; a finer linen than any of the linen-weavers ; a more complicated as well as ornate cabinet , with more drawers and quaint hiding-places , than any of the cabinet-makers ; a sword-blade more cunningly damasked , and a hilt more gorgeously jewelled , than any of the sword-makers ; a ring set with stones more precious , more brilliant in colour , and more beautifully combined , than any of the jewellers : in short , as I say , without knowing a single device of one of the arts in question , he surpassed every one of the competitors in his own craft , won the favour of the king and the office he wished to confer , and , if I remember rightly , gained at length the king 's daughter to boot .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 44]: For a long time Willie had not uttered a single exclamation , and when the old woman looked up , fancying he must be asleep , she saw , to her disappointment , a cloud upon his face -- amounting to a frown .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 14]: `` What 's the matter with you , Willie , my chick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 8]: `` Have you got a headache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 25]: `` No , thank you , Mrs Wilson , '' answered Willie ; `` but I do n't like that story at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 7]: `` I 'm sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 33]: I thought I should be sure to please you this time ; it is one I never told you before , for I had quite forgotten it myself till this very afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 8]: Why do n't you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 7]: `` Because he was a cheat .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 21]: _ He _ could n't do the things ; it was only the fairy 's wand that did them . ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 19]: `` But he was such a good lad , and had been so kind to the fairy . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: `` That makes no difference .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 7]: He _ was n't _ good .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 22]: And the fairy was n't good either , or she would n't have set him to do such wicked things . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 7]: `` They were n't wicked things .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 20]: They were all first-rate -- everything that he made -- better than any one else could make them . ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 8]: `` But he did n't make them .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 19]: There was n't one of those poor fellows he cheated that was n't a better man than he .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 38]: The worst of them could do something with his own hands , and I do n't believe he could do anything , for if he had ever tried he would have hated to be such a sneak .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 14]: He cheated the king , too , and the princess , and everybody .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 18]: should n't I like to have been there , and to have beaten him wand and all !
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 21]: For somebody might have been able to make the things better still , if he had only known how . ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 50]: Mrs Wilson was disappointed -- perhaps a little ashamed that she had not thought of this before ; anyhow she grew cross ; and because she was cross , she grew unfair , and said to Willie -- `` You think a great deal of yourself , Master Willie !
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 18]: Pray what could those idle little hands of yours do , if you were to try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 16]: `` I do n't know , for I have n't tried , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 26]: `` It 's a pity you should n't , '' she rejoined , `` if you think they would turn out so very clever . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 32]: She did n't mean anything but crossness when she said this -- for which probably a severe rheumatic twinge which just then passed through her shoulder was also partly to blame .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 34]: But Willie took her up quite seriously , and asked in a tone that showed he wanted it accounted for -- `` Why have n't I ever done anything , Mrs Wilson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 16]: `` You ought to know that best yourself , '' she answered , still cross .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 10]: `` I suppose because you do n't like work .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 13]: Your good father and mother work very hard , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 12]: It 's a shame of you to be so idle . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 17]: This was rather hard on a boy of seven , for Willie was no more then .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 28]: It made him look very grave indeed , if not unhappy , for a little while , as he sat turning over the thing in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 12]: `` Is it wrong to play about , Mrs Wilson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 10]: he asked , after a pause of considerable duration .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 32]: `` No , indeed , my dear , '' she answered ; for during the pause she had begun to be sorry for having spoken so roughly to her little darling .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 6]: `` Does everybody work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 16]: `` Everybody that 's worth anything , and is old enough , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 6]: `` Does God work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 12]: he asked , after another pause , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 5]: `` No , child .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 7]: What should He work for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 22]: `` If everybody works that is good and old enough , then I think God must work , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: `` But I will ask my papa .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 6]: Am I old enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 19]: `` Well , you 're not old enough to do much , but you might do something . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: `` What could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 8]: Could I spin , Mrs Wilson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 20]: `` No , child ; that 's not an easy thing to do ; but you could knit . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 4]: `` Could I ?
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: What good would it do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 14]: `` Why , you could knit your mother a pair of stockings . ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 5]: `` Could I though ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 9]: Will you teach me , Mrs Wilson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 48]: Mrs Wilson very readily promised , foreseeing that so she might have a good deal more of the little man 's company , if indeed he was in earnest ; for she was very lonely , and was never so happy as when he was with her .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 46]: She said she would get him some knitting-needles -- wires she called them -- that very evening ; she had some wool , and if he came to-morrow , she would soon see whether he was old enough and clever enough to learn to knit .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 62]: She advised him , however , to say nothing about it to his mother till she had made up her mind whether or not he could learn ; for if he could , then he might surprise her by taking her something of his own knitting -- at least a pair of muffetees to keep her wrists warm in the winter .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 8]: Willie went home solemn with his secret .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 60]: The next day he began to learn , and although his fingers annoyed him a good deal at first by refusing to do exactly as he wanted them , they soon became more obedient ; and before the new year arrived , he had actually knitted a pair of warm white lamb 's - wool stockings for his mother .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 81]: I am bound to confess that when first they were finished they were a good deal soiled by having been on the way so long , and perhaps partly by the little hands not always being so clean as they might have been when he turned from play to work ; but Mrs Wilson washed them herself , and they looked , if not as white as snow , at least as white as the whitest lamb you ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 65]: I will not attempt to describe the delight of his mother , the triumph of Willie , or the gratification of his father , who saw in this good promise of his boy 's capacity ; for all that I have written hitherto is only introductory to my story , and I long to begin and tell it you in a regular straightforward fashion .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 110]: Before I begin , however , I must not forget to tell you that Willie did ask his father the question with Mrs Wilson 's answer to which he had not been satisfied -- I mean the question whether God worked ; and his father 's answer , after he had sat pondering for a while in his chair , was something to this effect : -- `` Yes , Willie ; it seems to me that God works more than anybody -- for He works all night and all day , and , if I remember rightly , Jesus tells us somewhere that He works all Sunday too .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 12]: If He were to stop working , everything would stop being .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 62]: The sun would stop shining , and the moon and the stars ; the corn would stop growing ; there would be no more apples or gooseberries ; your eyes would stop seeing ; your ears would stop hearing ; your fingers could n't move an inch ; and , worst of all , your little heart would stop loving . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 21]: `` No , papa , '' cried Willie ; `` I should n't stop loving , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 8]: `` Indeed you would , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 7]: `` Not you and mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 20]: `` Yes ; you would n't love us any more than if you were dead asleep without dreaming . ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 7]: `` That would be dreadful . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 5]: `` Yes it would .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 26]: So you see how good God is to us -- to go on working , that we may be able to love each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 24]: `` Then if God works like that all day long , it must be a fine thing to work , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 28]: It is a fine thing to work -- the finest thing in the world , if it comes of love , as God 's work does . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 21]: This conversation made Willie quite determined to learn to knit ; for if God worked , he would work too .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 47]: And although the work he undertook was a very small work , it was like all God 's great works , for every loop he made had a little love looped up in it , like an invisible , softest , downiest lining to the stockings .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 79]: And after those , he went on knitting a pair for his father ; and indeed , although he learned to work with a needle as well , and to darn the stockings he had made , and even tried his hand at the spinning -- of which , however , he could not make much for a long time -- he had not left off knitting when we come to begin the story in the next chapter .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 10]: HE IS TURNED INTO SOMETHING HE NEVER WAS BEFORE .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 29]: Hitherto I have been mixing up summer and winter and everything all together , but now I am going to try to keep everything in its own place .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 7]: Willie was now nine years old .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 25]: His mother had been poorly for some time -- confined to her room , as she not unfrequently was in the long cold winters .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 92]: It was winter now ; and one morning , when all the air was dark with falling snow , he was standing by the parlour window , looking out on it , and wondering whether the angels made it up in the sky ; for he thought it might be their sawdust , which , when they had too much , they shook down to get melted and put out of the way ; when Tibby came into the room very softly , and looking , he thought , very strange .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 22]: `` Willie , your mamma wants you , '' she said ; and Willie hastened up-stairs to his mother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 18]: Dark as was the air outside , he was surprised to find how dark the room was .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 36]: And what surprised him more was a curious noise which he heard the moment he entered it , like the noise of a hedgehog , or some other little creature of the fields or woods .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 23]: But he crept gently up to his mother 's bed , saying -- `` Are you better this morning , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 18]: And she answered in a feeble sweet voice -- `` Yes , Willie , very much better .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 13]: And , Willie , God has sent you a little sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 4]: `` O-o-o-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 3]: cried Willie .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 5]: `` A little sister !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 7]: Did He make her Himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 17]: `` Yes ; He made her Himself ; and sent her to you last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 10]: `` How busy He must have been lately ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 5]: `` Where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 9]: I _ should _ like to see her .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 8]: Is she my very own sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 19]: `` Yes , your very own sister , Willie -- to love and take care of always . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 6]: `` Where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 12]: `` Go and ask nurse to let you see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 20]: Then Willie saw that there was a strange woman in the room , with something lying on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 46]: He went up to her , and she folded back the corner of a blanket , and revealed a face no bigger than that of the big doll at the clergyman 's house , but alive , quite alive -- such a pretty little face !
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 9]: He stood staring at it for a while .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 9]: `` May I kiss her , nurse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 9]: `` Yes -- gently -- quite gently . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 14]: He kissed her , half afraid , he did not know of what .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 14]: Her cheek was softer and smoother than anything he had ever touched before .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 14]: He sped back to his mother , too full of delight to speak .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 46]: But she was not yet well enough to talk to him , and his father coming in , led him down-stairs again , where he began once more to watch the snow , wondering now if it had anything to do with baby 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 30]: In the afternoon , it was found that the lock of his mother 's room not only would not catch easily , but made a noise that disturbed her .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 18]: So his father got a screwdriver and removed it , making as little noise as he could .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 45]: Next he contrived a way , with a piece of string , for keeping the door shut , and as that would not hold it close enough , hung a shawl over it to keep the draught out -- all which proceeding Willie watched .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 37]: As soon as he had finished , and the nurse had closed the door behind them , Mr Macmichael set out to take the lock to the smithy , and allowed Willie to go with him .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 29]: By the time they reached it , the snow was an inch deep on their shoulders , on Willie 's cap , and on his father 's hat .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 11]: How red the glow of the smith 's fire looked !
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 18]: It was a great black cavern with a red heart to it in the midst of whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 16]: The smith was a great powerful man , with bare arms , and blackened face .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 17]: When they entered , he and two other men were making the axle of a wheel .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 34]: They had a great lump of red-hot iron on the anvil , and were knocking a big hole through it -- not boring it , but knocking it through with a big punch .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 94]: One of the men , with a pair of tongs-like pincers , held the punch steady in the hole , while the other two struck the head of it with alternate blows of mighty hammers called sledges , each of which it took the strength of two brawny arms to heave high above the head with a great round swing over the shoulder , that it might come down with right good force , and drive the punch through the glowing iron , which was , I should judge , four inches thick .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 126]: All this Willie thought he could understand , for he knew that fire made the hardest metal soft ; but what he could n't at all understand was this : every now and then they stopped heaving their mighty sledges , the third man took the punch out of the hole , and the smith himself , whose name was Willet -LRB- and _ will it _ he did with a vengeance , when he had anything on the anvil before him -RRB- , caught up his tongs in his hand , then picked up a little bit of black coal with the tongs , and dropped it into the hole where the punch had been , where it took fire immediately and blazed up .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 68]: Then in went the punch again , and again the huge hammering commenced , with such bangs and blows , that the smith was wise to have no floor to his smithy , for they would surely have knocked a hole in that , though they were not able to knock the anvil down halfway into the earth , as the giant smith in the story did .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 82]: While this was going on , Mr Macmichael , perceiving that the operation ought not to be interrupted any more than a surgical one , stood quite still waiting , and Willie stood also -- absorbed in staring , and gradually creeping nearer and nearer to the anvil , for there were no sparks flying about to make it dangerous to the eyes , as there would have been if they had been striking the iron itself instead of the punch .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 27]: As soon as the punch was driven through , and the smith had dropped his sledge-hammer , and begun to wipe his forehead , Willie spoke .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 39]: `` Mr Willet , '' he said , for he knew every man of any standing in the village by name and profession , `` why did you put bits of coal into the hole you were making ?
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 16]: I should have thought it would be in the way rather than help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 43]: `` So it would , my little man , '' answered Willet , with no grim though grimy smile , `` if it did n't take fire and keep getting out of the way all the time it kept up the heat .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 64]: You see we depend on the heat for getting through , and it 's much less trouble to drop a bit of coal or two into the hole , than to take up the big axle and lay it in the fire again , not to mention the time and the quantity of coal it would take to heat it up afresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 13]: `` But such little bits of coal could n't do much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 42]: `` They could do enough , and all that 's less after that is saving , '' said the smith , who was one of those men who can not only do a thing right but give a reason for it .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 18]: `` You see I was able to put the little bits just in the right place . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 4]: `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 4]: I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 3]: cried Willie .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 4]: `` I understand !
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 22]: But , papa , do you think Mr Willet is the proper person to ask to set your lock right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 35]: `` I have n't a doubt of it , '' said Mr Macmichael , taking it out of his greatcoat pocket , and unfolding the piece of paper in which he had wrapped it .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 11]: `` Why do you make a question of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 11]: `` Because look what great big huge things he does !
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 14]: How could those tremendous hammers set such a little thing as that right ?
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 8]: They would knock it all to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 14]: Do n't you think you had better take it to the watchmaker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 23]: `` If I did , Willie , do you know what you would say the moment you saw him at work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 5]: `` No , papa .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: What should I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 24]: `` You would say , ` Do n't you think , papa , you had better take it back to the smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 9]: `` But why should I say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 33]: `` Because , when you saw his tools beside this lock , you would think the tools so small and the lock so huge , that nothing could be done between them .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 17]: Yet I daresay the watchmaker could set the lock all right if he chose to try .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 10]: Do n't you think so , Mr Willet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 12]: `` Not a doubt of it , '' answered the smith .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 10]: `` Had we better go to him then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 26]: `` Well , '' answered the smith , smiling , `` I think perhaps he would ask you why you had n't come to me .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 17]: No doubt he could do it , but I 've got better tools for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 7]: Let me look at the lock .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 13]: I 'm sure I shall be able to set it right . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 14]: `` Not with that great big hammer , then , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 10]: `` No ; I have smaller hammers than that .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 9]: When do you want it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 29]: `` Could you manage to do it at once , and let me take it home , for there 's a little baby there , just arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 8]: `` You do n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 7]: said the smith , looking surprised .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 9]: `` I wish you joy , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 18]: `` And this is the lock of the room she 's in , '' continued the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 15]: `` And you 're afraid of her getting out and flying off again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 4]: said the smith .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 8]: `` I will do it at once .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 11]: There is n't much wrong with it , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 11]: I hope Mrs Macmichael is doing well , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 17]: He took the lock , drew several screws from it , and then forced it open .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 23]: `` It 's nothing but the spring gone , '' he said , as he took out something and threw it away .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: Then he took out several more pieces , and cleaned them all .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 34]: Then he searched in a box till he found another spring , which he put in instead of the broken one , after snipping off a little bit with a pair of pincers .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 46]: Then he put all the pieces in , put on the cover of it , gave something a few taps with a tiny hammer , replaced the screws , and said -- `` Shall I come and put it on for you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 17]: `` No , no ; I am up to that much , '' said Mr Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 7]: `` I can easily manage that .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 4]: Come , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: I 'm much obliged to you for doing it at once .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 18]: Then out they went into the snowstorm again , Willie holding fast by his father 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 10]: `` This is good , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 20]: `` Your mother will have a better day all to-morrow , and perhaps a longer sleep to-night for it .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 14]: You see how easy it is to be both useful and kind sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 18]: The smith did more for your mother in those few minutes than ten doctors could have done .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 26]: Think of his great black fingers making a little more sleep and rest and warmth for her -- and all in those few minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 13]: `` Suppose he could n't have done it , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 9]: `` Do you think the watchmaker could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 15]: `` That I ca n't tell , but I do n't think it likely .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 13]: We should most probably have had to get a new one . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 11]: `` Suppose you could n't get a new one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 46]: `` Then we should have had to set our wits to work , and contrive some other way of fastening the door , so that mamma should n't take cold by its being open , nor yet be disturbed by the noise of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 14]: `` It would be so nice to be able to do everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 36]: `` So it would ; but nobody can ; and it 's just as well , for then we should not need so much help from each other , and would be too independent . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 17]: `` Then should n't a body try to do as many things as he can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 29]: `` Yes , for there 's no fear of ever being able to do without other people , and you would be so often able to help them .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 26]: Both the smith and the watch maker could mend a lock , but neither of them could do without the other for all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 46]: When Willie went to bed , he lay awake a long time , thinking how , if the lock could not have been mended , and there had been no other to be had , he could have contrived to keep the door shut properly .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 89]: In the morning , however , he told his father that he had not thought of any way that would do , for though he could contrive to shut and open the door well enough , he could not think how a person outside might be able to do it ; and he thought the best way , if such a difficulty should occur , would be to take the lock off his door , and put it on mamma 's till a better one could be got .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 15]: Of this suggestion his father , much to Willie 's satisfaction , entirely approved .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 5]: HE SERVES AN APPRENTICESHIP .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 43]: Willie 's mother grew better , and Willie 's sister grew bigger ; and the strange nurse went away , and Willie and his mother and Tibby , with a little occasional assistance from the doctor , managed the baby amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 18]: Considering that she had been yet only a short time at school , she behaved wonderfully well .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 24]: She never cried except she was in some trouble , and even then you could seldom have seen a tear on her face .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 25]: She did all that was required of her , grew longer and broader and heavier , and was very fond of a lighted candle .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 20]: The only fault she had was that she would n't give Willie quite so many smiles as he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 29]: As to the view she took of affairs , she seemed for a long time to be on the whole very well satisfied with life and its gifts .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 20]: But when at last its troubles began to overtake her , she did not approve of them at all .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 21]: The first thing she objected to was being weaned , which she evidently considered a very cruel and unnecessary experience .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 23]: But her father said it must be , and her mother , believing him to know best , carried out his decree .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 42]: Little Agnes endured it tolerably well in the daytime , but in the night protested lustily -- was indeed so outrageously indignant , that one evening the following conversation took place at the tea-table , where Willie sat and heard it .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 25]: `` Really , my dear , '' said Mrs Macmichael , `` I can not have your rest disturbed in this way another night .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 19]: You must go to Willie 's room , and let me manage the little squalling thing myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 13]: `` Why should n't I take my share of the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 4]: objected her husband .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 39]: `` Because you may be called up any moment , and have no more sleep till next night ; and it is not fair that what sleep your work does let you have should be so unnecessarily broken .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 13]: It 's not as if I could n't manage without you . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 18]: `` But Willie 's bed is not big enough for both of us , '' he objected .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 11]: `` Then Willie can come and sleep with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 14]: `` But Willie wants his sleep as much as I do mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 25]: `` There 's no fear of him : he would sleep though all the babies in Priory Leas were crying in the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 6]: `` Would I really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 9]: thought Willie , feeling rather ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 14]: `` But who will get up and warm the milk-and-water for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 4]: pursued his father .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 8]: I can manage that quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 10]: `` Could n't I do that , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 20]: said Willie , very humbly , for he thought of what his mother had said about his sleeping powers .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 16]: `` No , my pet , '' she answered ; and he said no more .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 17]: `` It seems to me , '' said his father , `` a very clumsy necessity .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 7]: I have been thinking over it .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 35]: To keep a fire in all night only to warm such a tiny drop of water as she wants , I must say , seems like using a steam-engine to sweep up the crumbs .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 55]: If you would just get a stone bottle , fill it with boiling water , wrap a piece of flannel about it , and lay it anywhere in the bed , it would be quite hot enough even in the morning to make the milk as warm as she ought to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 28]: `` If you will go to Willie 's room , and let Willie come and sleep with me , I will try it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 24]: Mr Macmichael consented ; and straightway Willie was filled with silent delight at the thought of sleeping with his mother and the baby .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 38]: Nor because of that only ; for he resolved within himself that he would try to get a share in the business of the night : why should his mother have too little sleep rather than himself ?
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 11]: They might at least divide the too little between them !
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 31]: So he went to bed early , full of the thought of waking up as soon as Agnes should begin to cry , and finding out what he could do .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 27]: Already he had begun to be useful in the daytime , and had twice put her to sleep when both his mother and Tibby had failed .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 36]: And although he quite understood that in all probability he would not have succeeded if they had n't tried first , yet it had been some relief to them , and they had confessed it .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 43]: But when he woke , there lay his mother and his sister both sound asleep ; the sun was shining through the blind ; he heard Tibby about the house ; and , in short , it was time to get up .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 23]: At breakfast , his father said to him -- `` Well , Willie , how did Agnes behave herself last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 5]: `` So well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 10]: answered Willie ; `` she never cried once . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 5]: `` O Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 29]: said his mother , laughing , `` she screamed for a whole hour , and was so hungry after it that she emptied her bottle without stopping once .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 13]: You were sound asleep all the time , and never stirred . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 26]: Willie was so much ashamed of himself , although he was n't in the least to blame , that he could hardly keep from crying .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 81]: He did not say another word , except when he was spoken to , all through breakfast , and his father and mother were puzzled to think what could be the matter with him : He went about the greater part of the morning moodily thinking ; then for advice betook himself to Mrs Wilson , who gave him her full attention , and suggested several things , none of which , however , seemed to him likely to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 61]: `` If I could but go to bed after mamma was asleep , '' he said , `` I could tie a string to my hair , and then slip a loop at the other end over mamma 's wrist , so that when she sat up to attend to Agnes , she would pull my hair and wake me .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 17]: Would n't she wonder what it was when she felt it pulling _ her _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 12]: He had to go home without any help from Mrs Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 45]: All the way he kept thinking with himself something after this fashion -- `` Mamma wo n't wake me , and Agnes ca n't ; and the worst of it is that everybody else will be just as fast asleep as I shall be .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 15]: Let me see -- who _ is _ there that 's awake all night ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 82]: There 's the cat : I think she is , but then she would n't know when to wake me , and even if I could teach her to wake me the moment Agnes cried , I do n't think she would be a nice one to do it ; for if I did n't come awake with a pat of her velvety pin-cushions , she might turn out the points of the pins in them , and scratch me awake .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 25]: There 's the clock ; it 's always awake ; but it ca n't tell you the time till you go and ask it .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 31]: I think it might be made to wind up a string that should pull me when the right time came ; but I do n't think I could teach it .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 22]: And when it came to the pull , the pull might stop the clock , and what would papa say then ?
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 20]: They tell me the owls are up all night , but they 're no good , I 'm certain .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 12]: I do n't see what I _ am _ to do .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 15]: I wonder if God would wake me if I were to ask Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 16]: I do n't know whether Willie did or did not ask God to wake him .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 22]: I did not inquire , for what goes on of that kind , it is better not to talk much about .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 52]: What I do know is , that he fell asleep with his head and heart full of desire to wake and help his mother ; and that , in the middle of the night , he did wake up suddenly , and there was little Agnes screaming with all her might .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 7]: He sat up in bed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 9]: `` Lie down and go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 9]: `` Baby 's crying , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 5]: `` Never you mind .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 6]: I 'll manage her . ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 20]: `` Do you know , mamma , I think I was waked up just in time to help you .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: I 'll take her from you , and perhaps she will take her drink from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 5]: `` Nonsense , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 7]: Lie down , my pet . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 11]: `` But I 've been thinking about it , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 34]: Do you remember , yesterday , Agnes would not take her bottle from you , and screamed and screamed ; but when Tibby took her , she gave in and drank it all ?
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 10]: Perhaps she would do the same with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 21]: -LSB- Illustration : `` WILLIE SAT DOWN WITH THE BABY ON HIS KNEES , AND SHE STOPPED CRYING . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 19]: As he spoke he slipped out of bed , and held out his arms to take the baby .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 20]: The light was already coming in , just a little , through the blind , for it was summer .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 25]: He heard a cow lowing in the fields at the back of the house , and he wondered whether her baby had woke her .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 26]: The next moment he had little Agnes in his arms , for his mother thought he might as well try , seeing he was awake .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 14]: `` Do take care and do n't let her fall , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 7]: `` That I will , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 6]: I 've got her tight .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: Now give me the bottle , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 20]: `` I have n't got it ready yet ; for you woke the minute she began to cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 26]: So Willie walked about the room with Agnes till his mother had got her bottle filled with nice warm milk-and-water and just a little sugar .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 44]: When she gave it to him , he sat down with the baby on his knees , and , to his great delight , and the satisfaction of his mother as well , she stopped crying , and began to drink the milk-and-water .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 12]: `` Why , you 're a born nurse , Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 27]: But the moment the baby heard her mother 's voice , she forsook the bottle , and began to scream , wanting to go to her .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 4]: `` O mamma !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 28]: you must n't speak , please ; for of course she likes you better than the bottle ; and when you speak that reminds her of you .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 9]: It was just the same with Tibby yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 23]: Or if you must speak , speak with some other sound , and not in your own soft , sweet way . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 33]: A few moments after , Willie was so startled by a gruff voice in the room that he nearly dropped the bottle ; but it was only his mother following his directions .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 34]: The plan was quite successful , for the baby had not a suspicion that the voice was her mother 's , paid no heed to it , and attended only to her bottle .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 39]: Mr Macmichael , who had been in the country , was creeping up the stair to his room , fearful of disturbing his wife , when what should he hear but a man 's voice as he supposed !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 12]: and what should he think but that robbers had broken in !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 11]: Of course he went to his wife 's room first .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 36]: There he heard the voice plainly enough through the door , but when he opened it he could see no one except Willie feeding the baby on an ottoman at the foot of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 56]: When his wife had explained what and why it was , they both laughed heartily over Willie 's suggestion for leaving the imagination of little Agnes in repose ; and henceforth he was installed as night-nurse , so long as the process of weaning should last ; and very proud of his promotion he was .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 27]: He slept as sound as ever , for he had no anxiety about waking ; his mother always woke him the instant Agnes began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: `` Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: she would say , `` Willie !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 8]: here 's your baby wanting you . ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 25]: And up Willie would start , sometimes before he was able to open his eyes , for little boys ' eyelids are occasionally obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 16]: And once he jumped out of bed crying , `` Where is she , mamma ?
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 6]: I 've lost her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: for he had been dreaming about her .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 27]: You may be sure his mamma let him have a long sleep in the morning always , to make up for being disturbed in the night .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 8]: Agnes throve well , notwithstanding the weaning .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 15]: She soon got reconciled to the bottle , and then Willie slept in peace .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 7]: HE GOES TO LEARN A TRADE .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 7]: Time passed , and Willie grew .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 11]: Have my readers ever thought what is meant by growing ?
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 13]: It is far from meaning only that you get bigger and stronger .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 20]: It means that you become able both to understand and to wonder at more of the things about you .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 25]: There are people who the more they understand , wonder the less ; but such are not growing straight ; they are growing crooked .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 7]: There are two ways of growing .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 28]: You may be growing up , or you may be growing down ; and if you are doing both at once , then you are growing crooked .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 15]: There are people who are growing up in understanding , but down in goodness .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 46]: It is a beautiful fact , however , that you ca n't grow up in goodness and down in understanding ; while the great probability is , that , if you are not growing better , you will by and by begin to grow stupid .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 33]: Those who are growing the right way , the more they understand , the more they wonder ; and the more they learn to do , the more they want to do .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 8]: Willie was a boy of this kind .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 24]: I do n't care to write about boys and girls , or men and women , who are not growing the right way .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 9]: They are not interesting enough to write about .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 34]: But he was not the only one to grow : Agnes grew as well ; and the more Willie grew capable of helping her , the more he found Agnes required of him .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 25]: It was a long time , however , before he knew how much he was obliged to Agnes for requiring so much of him .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 77]: She grew and grew until she was capable of a doll ; when of course a doll was given her -- not a new one just bought , but a most respectable old doll , a big one that had been her mother 's when she was a little girl , and which she had been wise enough to put in her trunk before she left her mother 's house to go home with Mr Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 27]: She made some new clothes for it now , and Tibby made a cloak and bonnet for her to wear when she went out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 52]: But it struck Willie that her shoes , which were only of cloth , were very unfit for walking , and he thought that in a doctor 's family it was something quite amazing that , while head and shoulders were properly looked after , the feet should remain utterly neglected .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 33]: It was clear that must be his part in the affair ; it could not be anybody else 's , for in that case some one else would have attended to it .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 6]: He must see about it .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 27]: I think I have said before that Willie knew almost everybody in the village , and I might have added that everybody without exception knew him .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 51]: He was a favourite -- first of all , because his father was much loved and trusted ; next , because his mother spoke as kindly to her husband 's poor patients as to the richer ones ; and last , because he himself spoke to everybody with proper respect .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 15]: Some of the people , however , he knew of course better than others .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 9]: Of these Mrs Wilson we know was one .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 20]: But I believe I also mentioned that in the house in which she lived there were other poor people .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 40]: In the room opposite to hers , on the ground-floor , lived and worked a shoemaker -- a man who had neither wife nor child , nor , so far as people knew , any near relative at all .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 39]: He was far from being in good health , and although he worked from morning to night , had a constant pain in his back , which was rather crooked , having indeed a little hump on it .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 33]: If his temper was not always of the best , I wonder what cleverest of watches or steam-engines would go as well as he did with such a twist in its back ?
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 156]: To see him seated on his low stool -- in which , by the way , as if it had not been low enough , he sat in a leather-covered hole , perhaps for the sake of the softness and spring of the leather -- with his head and body bent forward over his lapstone or his last , and his right hand with the quick broad-headed hammer hammering up and down on a piece of sole-leather ; or with both his hands now meeting as if for a little friendly chat about something small , and then suddenly starting asunder as if in astonished anger , with a portentous hiss , you might have taken him for an automaton moved by springs , and imitating human actions in a very wonderful manner -- so regular and machine-like were his motions , and so little did he seem to think about what he was at .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 91]: A little passing attention , a hint now and then from his head , was sufficient to keep his hands right , for they were so used to their work , and had been so well taught by his head , that they could pretty nearly have made a pair of shoes of themselves ; so that the shoemaking trade is one that admits of a great deal of thought going on in the head that hangs over the work , like a sun over the earth ripening its harvest .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 42]: Shoemakers have distinguished themselves both in poetry and in prose ; and if Hector Macallaster had done so in neither , he could yet think , and that is what some people who write both poetry and prose can not do .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 41]: But it is of infinitely more importance to be able to think well than merely to write ever so well ; and , besides , to think well is what everybody ought to be or to become able to do .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 26]: Hector had odd ways of looking at things , but I need not say more about that , for it will soon be plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 102]: Ever since the illness from which he had risen with a weak spine , and ever-working brain , and a quiet heart , he had shown himself not merely a good sort of man , for such he had always been , but a religious man ; not by saying much , for he was modest even to shyness with grown people , but by the solemnity of his look when a great word was spoken , by his unblamable behaviour , and by the readiness with which he would lend or give of his small earnings to his poor neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 34]: The only thing of which anybody could complain was his temper ; but it showed itself only occasionally , and almost everybody made excuse for it on the ground of his bodily ailments .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 9]: He gave it no quarter himself , however .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 60]: He said once to the clergyman , to whom he had been lamenting the trouble he had with it , and who had sought to comfort him by saying that it was caused by the weakness of his health -- `` No , sir -- excuse me ; nobody knows how much I am indebted to my crooked back .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 17]: If it were n't for that I might have a bad temper and never know it .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 34]: But that drives it out of its hole , and when I see the ugly head of it I know it 's there , and try once more to starve it to death .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 4]: But oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 8]: it 's such a creature to burrow !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 37]: When I think I 've built it in all round , out comes its head again at a place where I never looked to see it , and it 's all to do over again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 26]: You will understand by this already that the shoemaker thought after his own fashion , which is the way everybody who can think does think .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 17]: What he thought about his trade and some other things we shall see by and by .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 63]: When Willie entered his room , he greeted him with a very friendly nod ; for not only was he fond of children , but he had a special favour for Willie , chiefly because he considered himself greatly indebted to him for something he had said to Mrs Wilson , and which had given him a good deal to think about .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 27]: For Mrs Wilson often had a chat with Hector , and then she would not unfrequently talk about Willie , of whose friendship she was proud .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 50]: She had told him of the strange question he had put to her as to whether God worked , and the shoemaker , thinking over it , had come to the same conclusion as Willie 's father , and it had been a great comfort and help to him .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 12]: `` What can I do for you to-day , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 22]: he said ; for in that part of the country they do not say _ Master _ and _ Miss _ .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 15]: `` You look , '' he added , `` if you wanted something . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 14]: `` I want you to teach me , please , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 7]: `` To teach you what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 3]: asked Hector .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 11]: `` To make shoes , please , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: but do you think that would be prudent of me ?
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 37]: Do n't you see , if I were to teach you to make shoes , people would be coming to you to make their shoes for them , and what would become of me then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 13]: `` But I only want to make shoes for Aggy 's doll .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 15]: She ought n't to go without shoes in this weather , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 21]: Well , if you will bring me the doll I will take her measure and make her a pair . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 24]: `` But I do n't think papa could afford to pay for shoes for a doll as well as for all of us .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 21]: You see , though it would be better , it 's not necessary that a doll should have strong shoes .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 17]: She has shoes good enough for indoors , and she need n't walk in the wet .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 10]: Do n't you think so yourself , Hector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 26]: `` But , '' returned Hector , `` I shall be happy to make Agnes a present of a pair of shoes for her doll .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: I should n't think of charging your papa for that .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 16]: He is far too good a man to be made to pay for everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 32]: `` But , '' objected Willie , `` to let you make them for nothing would be as bad as to make papa pay for them when they are not necessary .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 11]: Please , you must let me make them for Aggy .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 17]: Besides , she 's not old enough yet even to say thank you for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 60]: `` Then she wo n't be old enough to say thank you to you either , '' said Hector , who , all this time , had been losing no moment from his work , but was stitching away , with a bore , and a twiddle , and a hiss , at the sole of a huge boot .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 16]: but you see , she 's my own -- so it does n't matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 38]: If I were writing a big book , instead of a little one , I should be tempted to say not only that this set Hector a thinking , but what it made him think as well .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 50]: Instead of replying , however , he laid down his boot , rose , and first taking from a shelf a whole skin of calf-leather , and next a low chair from a corner of the room , he set the latter near his own seat opposite the window .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 36]: `` Sit down there , then , Willie , '' he said ; adding , as he handed him the calf-skin , `` There 's your leather , and my tools are at your service .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 7]: Make your shoes , and welcome .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 9]: I shall be glad of your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 25]: Having thus spoken , he sat down again , caught up his boot hurriedly , and began stitching away as if for bare life .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 11]: Willie took the calf-skin on his lap , somewhat bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 34]: If he had been asked to cut out a pair of seven-leagued boots for the ogre , there would have seemed to his eyes enough of leather for them in that one skin .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 22]: But how ever was he to find two pieces small enough for doll 's shoes in such an ocean of leather ?
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 52]: He began to turn it round and round , looking at it all along the edge , while Hector was casting sidelong glances at him in the midst of his busyness , with a curiosity on his face which his desire to conceal it caused to look grim instead of amused .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 80]: Willie , although he had never yet considered how shoes are made , had seen at once that nothing could be done until he had got the command of a manageable bit of leather ; he found too much only a shade better than too little ; and he saw that it would n't be wise to cut a piece out anywhere , for that might spoil what would serve for a large pair of shoes or even boots .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 16]: Therefore he kept turning the skin round until he came to a small projecting piece .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 38]: This he contemplated for some time , trying to recall the size of Dolly 's feet , and to make up his mind whether it would not be large enough for one or even for both shoes .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 13]: A smile passed over Hector 's face -- a smile of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 6]: `` That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 7]: `` I think you 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 21]: That 's the first thing -- to consider your stuff , and see how much you can make of it .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 13]: Waste is a thing that no good shoemaker ever yet could endure .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 10]: It 's bad in itself , and so unworkmanlike !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 9]: Yes , I think that corner will do .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 9]: Shall I cut it off for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 11]: `` No , thank you -- not yet , please .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 24]: I think I must go and look at her feet , for I ca n't recollect _ quite _ how big they are .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 9]: I 'll just run home and look . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 25]: `` Do you think you will be able to carry the exact size in your head , and bring it back with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 9]: `` Yes , I think I shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 5]: `` I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 12]: I never could trust myself so far as that , nearly .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 24]: You might be pretty nigh it one way and all wrong another , for you have to consider length and breadth and roundabout .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 14]: I will tell you the best way for _ you _ to do .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 28]: Set the doll standing on a bit of paper , and draw a pencil all round her foot with the point close to it on the paper .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 22]: Both feet will be better , for it would be a mistake to suppose they must be of the same size .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 10]: That will give you the size of the sole .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 32]: Then take a strip of paper and see how long a piece it takes to go round the thickest part of the foot , and cut it off to that length .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 38]: That will be sufficient measurement for a doll 's shoe , for even if it should not fit exactly , she wo n't mind either being pinched a little or having to walk a little loose . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 46]: Willie got up at once to go and do as Hector had told him ; but Hector was not willing to part with him so soon , for it was not often he had anybody to talk to while he went on with his work .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 27]: Therefore he said -- `` But do n't you think , Willie , before you set about it , you had better see how I do ?
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 37]: It would be a pity to spend your labour in finding out for yourself what shoemakers have known for hundreds of years , and which you could learn so easily by letting me show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 12]: `` Thank you , '' said Willie , sitting down again .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 8]: `` I should like that very much .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 8]: I will sit and look at you .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 7]: I know what you are doing .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 11]: You are fastening on the sole of a boot . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 9]: Do you see how it 's done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 6]: `` I 'm not sure .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: I do n't see yet quite .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 13]: Of course I see you are sewing the one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 60]: I 've often wondered how you could manage with small shoes like mine to get in your hand to pull the needle through ; but I see you do n't use a needle , and I see that you are sewing it all on the outside of the boot , and do n't put your hand inside at all .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 9]: I ca n't get to understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 7]: `` You will in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 44]: You see how , all round the edge of the upper , as we call it , I have sewn on a strong narrow strip , so that one edge of the strip sticks out all round , while the other is inside .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 46]: To the edge that sticks out I sew on the sole , drawing my threads so tight that when I pare the edges off smooth , it will look like one piece , and puzzle anybody who did not know how it was done . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 6]: `` I think I understand .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 20]: But how do you get your thread so sharp and stiff as to go through the holes you make ?
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 44]: I find it hard enough sometimes to get a thread through the eye of a needle ; for though the thread is ever so much smaller than yours , I have to sharpen and sharpen it often before I can get it through .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 32]: But yours , though it is so thick , keeps so sharp that it goes through the holes at once -- two threads at once -- one from each side ! ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 16]: but I do n't sharpen my thread ; I put a point upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 10]: `` Does n't that mean the same thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 20]: `` Well , it may generally ; but _ I _ do n't mean the same thing by it .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 4]: Look here . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 19]: cried Willie ; `` there is a long bit of something else , not thread , upon it .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 19]: It looks like a hair , only thicker , and it is so sharp at the point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 7]: `` Ca n't you guess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: `` No ; I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 7]: `` Then I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 11]: It is a bristle out of a hog 's back .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 12]: I do n't know what a shoemaker would do without them .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 11]: Look , here 's a little bunch of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 16]: `` That 's a very clever use to put them to , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 13]: `` Do you go and pluck them out of the pigs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 10]: `` No ; we buy them at the shop .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 11]: We want a good many , for they wear out .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 29]: They get too soft , and though they do n't break right off , they double up in places , so that they wo n't go through . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: `` How do you fasten them to the thread ? ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 8]: `` Look here , '' said Hector .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 71]: He took several strands of thread together , and drew them through and through a piece of cobbler 's wax , then took a bristle and put it in at the end cunningly , in a way Willie could n't quite follow ; and then rolled and rolled threads and all over and over between his hand and his leather apron , till it seemed like a single dark-coloured cord .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 16]: `` There , you see , is my needle and thread all in one . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 18]: `` And what is the good of rubbing it so much with the cobbler 's wax ? ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 10]: `` There are several good reasons for doing that .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 17]: In the first place , it makes all the threads into one by sticking them together .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 27]: Next it would be worn out before I had drawn it many times through but for the wax , which keeps the rubbing from wearing it .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 15]: The wax also protects it afterwards , and keeps the wet from rotting it .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 54]: The waxed thread fills the hole better too , and what is of as much consequence as anything , it sticks so that the last stitch does n't slacken before the next comes , but holds so tight that , although the leather is very springy , it can not make it slip .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 28]: The two pieces are thus got so close together that they are like one piece , as you will see when I pare the joined edges . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 73]: I should tire my reader if I were to recount all the professional talk that followed ; for although Willie found it most interesting , and began to feel as if he should soon be able to make a shoe himself , it is a very different thing merely to read about it -- the man 's voice not in your ears , and the work not going on before your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 39]: But the shoemaker cared for other things besides shoemaking , and after a while he happened to make a remark which led to the following question from Willie : -- `` Do you understand astronomy , Hector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 12]: It 's not my business , you see , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 36]: `` But you 've just been telling me so much about the moon , and the way she keeps turning her face always to us -- in the politest manner , as you said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 12]: `` I got it all out of Mr Dick 's book .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 6]: I do n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 9]: I do n't know why she does so .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 37]: I know a few things that are not my business , just as you know a little about shoemaking , that not being your business ; but I do n't understand them for all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: `` Whose business is astronomy then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 43]: `` Well , '' answered Hector , a little puzzled , `` I do n't see how it can well be anybody 's business but God 's , for I 'm sure no one else can lay a hand to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 10]: `` And what 's your business , Hector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 8]: asked Willie , in a half-absent mood .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 23]: Some readers may perhaps think this a stupid question , and perhaps so it was ; but Willie was not therefore stupid .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 53]: People sometimes _ appear _ stupid because they have more things to think about than they can well manage ; while those who think only about one or two things may , on the contrary , _ appear _ clever when just those one or two things happen to be talked about .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 8]: `` What is my business , Willie ?
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 14]: Why , to keep people out of the dirt , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 4]: asked Willie again .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 8]: `` By making and mending their shoes .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 33]: Mr Dick , now , when he goes out to look at the stars through his telescope , might get his death of cold if his shoemaker did not know his business .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 34]: Of the general business , it 's a part God keeps to Himself to see that the stars go all right , and that the sun rises and sets at the proper times .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 34]: For the time 's not the same any two mornings running , you see , and he might make a mistake if he was n't looked after , and that would be serious .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 18]: But I told you I do n't understand about astronomy , because it 's not my business .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 57]: I 'm set to keep folk 's feet off the cold and wet earth , and stones and broken glass ; for however much a man may be an astronomer and look up at the sky , he must touch the earth with some part of him , and generally does so with his feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 12]: `` And God sets you to do it , Hector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 11]: It 's the way He looks after people 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 17]: He 's got to look after everything , you know , or everything would go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 49]: So He gives me the leather and the tools and the hands -- and I must say the head , for it wants no little head to make a _ good _ shoe to measure -- and it is as if He said to me -- ` There !
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 12]: you make shoes , while I keep the stars right . '
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 16]: Is n't it a fine thing to have a hand in the general business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 36]: And Hector looked up with shining eyes in the face of the little boy , while he pulled at his rosin-ends as if he would make the boot strong enough to keep out evil spirits .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 44]: `` I think it 's a fine thing to have to make nice new shoes , '' said Willie ; `` but I do n't think I should like to mend them when they are soppy and muddy and out of shape . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 18]: `` If you would take your share in the general business , you must n't be particular .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 27]: It wo n't do to be above your business , as they say : for my part , I would say _ below _ your business .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 9]: There 's those boots in the corner now .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: They belong to your papa .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 5]: And they come next .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 31]: Do n't you think it 's an honour to keep the feet of such a good man dry and warm as he goes about from morning to night comforting people ?
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 24]: Do n't you think it 's an honour to mend boots for _ him _ , even if they should be dirty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes -- for _ papa _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 15]: said Willie , as if his papa must be an exception to any rule .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 14]: `` Well , '' resumed Hector , `` look at these great lace-boots .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 14]: I shall have to fill the soles of them full of hobnails presently .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 13]: They belong to the best ploughman in the parish -- John Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 27]: Do n't you think it 's an honour to mend boots for a man who makes the best bed for the corn to die in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: `` I thought it was to grow in , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 9]: `` All the same , '' returned Hector .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 21]: `` When it dies it grows -- and not till then , as you will read in the New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 17]: Is n't it an honour , I say , to mend boots for John Turnbull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes -- for John Turnbull !
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 24]: I know John , '' said Willie , as if it made any difference to his merit whether Willie knew him or not !
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 19]: `` And there , '' Hector went on , `` lies a pair of slippers that want patching .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: They belong to William Webster , the weaver , round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 9]: They 're very much down at heel too .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 30]: But is n't it an honour to patch or set up slippers for a man who keeps his neighbours in fine linen all the days of their lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 4]: I know William .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 12]: It must be nice to do anything for William Webster . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 15]: `` Suppose you did n't know him , would that make any difference ? ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 12]: `` No , '' said Willie , after thinking a little .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 12]: `` Other people would know him if I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 31]: `` Yes , and if nobody knew him , God would know him ; and anybody God has thought worth making , it 's an honour to do anything for .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 22]: Believe me , Willie , to have to keep people 's feet dry and warm is a very important appointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 56]: `` Your own shoes are n't very good , Hector , '' said Willie , who had been casting glances from time to time at his companion 's feet , which were shod in a manner that , to say the least of it , would have prejudiced no one in favour of his handiwork .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 14]: `` Is n't it an honour to make shoes for yourself Hector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 25]: `` There ca n't be much honour in doing anything for yourself , '' replied Hector , `` so far as I can see .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 72]: I confess my shoes are hardly decent , but then I can make myself a pair at any time ; and indeed I 've been thinking I would for the last three months , as soon as a slack time came ; but I 've been far too busy as yet , and , as I do n't go out much till after it 's dusk , nobody sees them . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 15]: `` But if you should get your feet wet , and catch cold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 9]: that might be the death of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 3]: said Hector .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 9]: `` I really must make myself a pair .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 28]: Well now -- let me see -- as soon as I have mended those two pairs -- I can do them all to-morrow -- I will begin .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 84]: And I 'll tell you what , '' he added , after a thoughtful pause , `` if you 'll come to me the day after to-morrow , I will take that skin , and cut out a pair of shoes for myself , and you shall see how I do it , and everything about the making of them ; -- yes , you shall do some part of them yourself , and that shall be your first lesson in shoemaking . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 7]: `` But Dolly 's shoes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 3]: suggested Willie .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: `` Dolly can wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 14]: She wo n't take _ her _ death of cold from wet feet .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 19]: And let me tell you it is harder to make a small pair well than a large pair .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 21]: You will do Dolly 's ever so much better after you know how to make a pair for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 11]: HOW WILLIE LEARNED TO READ BEFORE HE KNEW HIS LETTERS .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 19]: The next day his thoughts , having nothing particular to engage them , kept brooding over two things .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 16]: These two things came together all at once , and a resolution was the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 8]: I shall soon explain what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 20]: The one thing was , that Hector had shown considerable surprise when he found that Willie could not read .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 19]: Now Willie was not in the least ashamed that he could not read : why should he be ?
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 41]: It was nowhere written in the catechism he had learnt that it was his duty to be able to read ; and if the catechism had merely forgotten to mention it , his father and mother would have told him .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 21]: Neither was it a duty he ought to have known of himself -- for then he would have known it .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 7]: So why should he be ashamed ?
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 13]: People are often ashamed of what they need not be ashamed of .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 37]: Again , they are often not at all ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of , and will turn up their faces to the sun when they ought to hide them in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 89]: If , for instance , Willie had ever put on a sulky face when his mother asked him to hold the baby for her , that would have been a thing for shame of which the skin of his face might well try to burn itself off ; but not to be able to read before he had even been made to think about it , was not at all a thing to be ashamed of : it would have been more of a shame to be ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 28]: Now that it had been put into his head , however , to think what a good thing reading was , all this would apply no longer .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 8]: It was a very different thing now .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 57]: The other subject which occupied his thoughts was this : Everybody was so kind to him -- so ready to do things for him -- and , what was of far more consequence , to teach him to do them himself ; while he , so far as he could think , did nothing for anybody !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 19]: That could not be right ; it _ could _ not be -- for it was not reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 68]: Not to mention his father and mother , there was Mrs Wilson , who had taught him to knit , and even given him a few lessons in spinning , though that had not come to much ; and here was Hector Macallaster going to teach him to make shoes ; and not one thing that he could think of was he capable of doing in return !
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 18]: This must be looked into , for things could not be allowed to go on like that .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 61]: All at once it struck him that Hector had said , with some regret in his voice , that though he had plenty of time to think , he had very little time to read ; also that although he could see well enough by candlelight to work at his trade , he could not see well enough to read .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 14]: What a fine thing it would be to learn to read to Hector !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 18]: It would be such fun to surprise him too , by all at once reading him something !
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 14]: The sun was not at his full height when Willie received this illumination .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 18]: Before the sun went down he knew and could read at sight at least a dozen words .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 26]: For the moment he saw that he ought to learn to read , he ran to his mother , and asked her to teach him .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 32]: She was delighted , for she had begun to be a little doubtful whether his father 's plan of leaving him alone till he wanted to learn was the right one .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 29]: But at that precise moment she was too busy with something that must be done for his father to lay it down and begin teaching him his letters .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 20]: Willie was so eager to learn , however , that he could not rest without doing something towards it .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 17]: He bethought himself a little -- then ran and got Dr Watts 's hymns for children .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 37]: He knew `` How doth the little busy bee '' so well as to be able to repeat it without a mistake , for his mother had taught it him , and he had understood it .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 28]: You see , he was not like a child of five , taught to repeat by rote lines which could give him no notions but mistaken ones .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 44]: Besides , he had a good knowledge of words , and could use them well in talk , although he could not read ; and it is a great thing if a child can talk well before he begins to learn to read .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 42]: He opened the little book at the Busy Bee , and knowing already enough to be able to divide the words the one from the other , he said to himself -- `` The first word must be _ How _ .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 14]: There it is , with a gap between it and the next word .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 16]: I will look and see if I can find another _ How _ anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 19]: He looked a long time before he found one ; for the capital H was in the way .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 40]: Of course there were a good many _ how 's _ , but not many with a big H , and he did n't know that the little _ h _ was just as good for the mere word .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 17]: Then he looked for _ doth _ , and he found several _ doth 's _ .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 27]: Of _ the 's _ he found as great a swarm as if they had been the bees themselves with which the little song was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 37]: _ Busy _ was scarce ; I am not sure whether he found it at all ; but he looked at it until he was pretty sure he should know it again when he saw it .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 44]: After he had gone over in this way every word of the first verse , he tried himself , by putting his finger at random here and there upon it , and seeing whether he could tell the word it happened to touch .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 10]: Sometimes he could , and sometimes he could n't .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 24]: However , as I said , before the day was over , he knew at least a dozen words perfectly well at sight .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 18]: Nor let any one think this was other than a great step in the direction of reading .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 15]: It would be easy for Willie afterwards to break up these words into letters .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 33]: It took him two days more -- for during part of each he was learning to make shoes -- to learn to know anywhere every word he had found in that hymn .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 31]: Next he took a hymn he had not learned , and applied to his mother when he came to a word he did not know , which was very often .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 36]: As soon as she told him one , he hunted about until he found another and another specimen of the same , and so went on until he had fixed it quite in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 38]: At length he began to compare words that were like each other , and by discovering wherein they looked the same , and wherein they looked different , he learned something of the sound of the letters .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 86]: For instance , in comparing _ the _ and _ these _ , although the one sound of the two letters , _ t _ and _ h _ , puzzled him , and likewise the silent _ e _ , he conjectured that the _ s _ must stand for the hissing sound ; and when he looked at other words which had that sound , and perceived an _ s _ in every one of them , then he was sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 67]: His mother had no idea how fast he was learning ; and when about a fortnight after he had begun , she was able to take him in hand , she found , to her astonishment , that he could read a great many words , but that , when she wished him to spell one , he had not the least notion what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: `` Is n't that a _ b _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 16]: she said , wishing to help him to find out a certain word for himself .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 21]: `` It 's not the busy bee , '' he added , laughing ; -- `` I should know him .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 11]: It must be the lazy one , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 9]: `` Do n't you know your letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 5]: `` No , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 4]: Which are they ?
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 9]: Are the rest yours and papa 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 8]: `` Oh , you silly dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: `` Of course I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: he returned ; -- `` very silly !
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 15]: How could any of them be mine before I know the names of them !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 24]: When I know them all , then they 'll all be mine , I suppose -- and everybody else 's who knows them .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 11]: -- So that 's Mr B -- is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 10]: And that 's C , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 22]: `` I 'm glad to see you , Mr C , '' said Willie , merrily , nodding to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 11]: `` We shall know each other when we meet again .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 9]: -- I suppose this is D , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 8]: How d' e do , Mr D ?
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 18]: And what 's this one with its mouth open , and half its tongue cut off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 26]: His mother told him it was E. `` Then this one , with no foot to stand on , is Fe , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 26]: His mother laughed ; but whoever gave it the name it has , would have done better to call it Fe , as Willie did .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 40]: It would be much better also , in teaching children , at least , to call H , He , and W , We , and Y , Ye , and Z , Ze , as Willie called them .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 24]: But it was easy enough for him to learn their names after he knew so much of what they could _ do _ .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 23]: What gave him a considerable advantage was , that he had begun with verse , and not dry syllables and stupid sentences .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 50]: The music of the verse repaid him at once for the trouble of making it out -- even before he got at the meaning , while the necessity of making each line go right , and the rhymes too , helped him occasionally to the pronunciation of a word .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 33]: The farther he got on , the faster he got on ; and before six weeks were over , he could read anything he was able to understand pretty well at sight .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 57]: By this time , also , he understood all the particulars as to how a shoe is made , and had indeed done a few stitches himself , a good deal of hammering both of leather and of hob-nails , and a little patching , at which last the smallness of his hands was an advantage .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 25]: At length , one day , he said to the shoemaker -- `` Shall I read a little poem to you , Hector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 12]: `` You told me you could n't read , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 7]: `` I can now though . ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: `` Do then , '' said Hector .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 59]: Looking for but a small result in such a short time , he was considerably astonished to find how well the boy could read ; for he not merely gave the words correctly , but the sentences , which is far more difficult ; that is , he read so that Hector could understand what the writer meant .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 9]: It is a great thing to read well .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 3]: Few can .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 30]: Whoever reads aloud and does not read well , is a sort of deceiver ; for he pretends to introduce one person to another , while he misrepresents him .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 39]: In after life , Willie continued to pay a good deal of attention not merely to reading for its own sake , but to reading for the sake of other people , that is , to reading aloud .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 91]: As often as he came , in the course of his own reading , to any verse that he liked very much , he always read it aloud in order to teach himself how it ought to be read ; doing his best -- first , to make it sound true , that is , to read it according to the sense ; next , to make it sound beautiful , that is , to read it according to the measure of the verse and the melody of the words .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 9]: He now read a great deal to Hector .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 44]: There came to be a certain time every day at which Willie Macmichael was joyfully expected by the shoemaker -- to read to him for an hour and a half -- beyond which time his father did not wish the reading to extend .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 11]: SOME THINGS THAT CAME OF WILLIE 'S GOING TO SCHOOL .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 23]: When his father found that he had learned to read , then he judged it good for him to go to school .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 6]: Willie was very much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 41]: His mother said she would make him a bag to carry his books in ; but Willie said there was no occasion to trouble herself ; for , if she would give him the stuff , he would make it .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 47]: So she got him a nice bit of green baize , and in the afternoon he made his bag -- no gobble-stitch work , but good , honest back-stitching , except the string-case , which was only run , that it might draw easier and tighter .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 43]: He passed the string through with a bodkin , fixed it in the middle , tied the two ends , and carried the bag to his mother , who pronounced it nearly as well made as if she had done it herself .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 78]: At school he found it more and more plain what a good thing it is that we have n't to find out every thing for ourselves from the beginning ; that people gather into books what they and all who went before them have learned , so that we come into their property , as it were ; and , after being taught of them , have only to begin our discoveries from where they leave off .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 61]: In geography , for instance , what a number of voyages and journeys have had to be made , and books to record them written ; then what a number of these books to be read , and the facts gathered out of them , before a single map could be drawn , not to say a geography book printed !
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 44]: Whereas now he could learn a multitude of things about the various countries , their peoples and animals and plants , their mountains and rivers and lakes and cities , without having set his foot beyond the parish in which he was born .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 9]: And so with everything else after its kind .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 22]: But it is more of what Willie learned to do than what he learned to know that I have to treat .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 16]: When he went to school , his father made him a present of a pocket-knife .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 32]: He had had one before , but not a very good one ; and this , having three blades , all very sharp , he found a wonderful treasure of recourse .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 10]: His father also bought him a nice new slate .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 23]: Now there was another handy boy at school , a couple of years older than Willie , whose father was a carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 31]: He had cut on the frame of his slate , not his initials only , but his whole name and address , -- _ Alexander Spelman , Priory Leas _ .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 34]: Willie thought how nice it would be with his new knife also to cut his name on his slate ; only he would rather make some difference in the way of doing it .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 31]: What if , instead of sinking the letters in the frame , he made them stand up from the frame by cutting it away to some depth all round them .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 33]: There was not much originality in this , for it was only reversing what Spelman had done ; but it was more difficult , and would , he thought , be prettier .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 8]: Then what was he thus to carve ?
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 54]: One would say , `` Why , _ William Macmichael _ , of course , and , if he liked , _ Priory Leas _ '' But Willie was a peculiar little fellow , and began to reason with himself whether he had any right to put his own name on the slate .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 21]: `` My father did not give me the slate , '' he said , `` to be my very own .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 13]: He gave me the knife like that , but not the slate .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 12]: When I am grown up , it will belong to Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 7]: What shall I put on it ?
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 20]: What 's mine 's papa 's , and what 's papa 's is his own , '' argued Willie .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 8]: -- '' _ I _ know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 7]: he said to himself at last .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 26]: The boys could n't imagine what he meant to do when they saw him draw first a D and then an O on the frame .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 21]: But when they saw a C and a T follow , they thought what a conceited little prig Willie was !
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 18]: `` Do you think you 're a doctor because your father is , you little ape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 3]: they said .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 31]: `` No , no , '' answered Willie , laughing heartily , but thinking , as he went on with his work , that he might be one some day .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 32]: When the drawing of the letters was finished , there stood , all round the slate , '' _ Doctor Macmichael 's Willie , The Ruins , Priory Leas _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 6]: Then out came his knife .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 23]: But it was a long job , for Willie was not one of those slovenly boys that _ scamp _ their work .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 33]: Such boys are nothing but soft , pulpy creatures , who , when they grow to be men , will be too soft for any of the hard work of the world .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 24]: They will be fit only for buffers , to keep the working men from breaking their heads against each other in their eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 97]: But the carving was at length finished , and gave much satisfaction -- first to Willie himself , because it was finished ; next , to Alexander Spelman , Priory Leas , because , being a generous-minded boy , he admired Willie 's new and superior work ; third , to Mr and Mrs Macmichael , because they saw in it , not the boy 's faculty merely , but his love to his father as well ; for the recognition of a right over us is one of the sweetest forms love can take . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 22]: _ I am yours _ '' is the best and greatest thing one can say , if to the right person .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 27]: It led to a strong friendship between him and Spelman , and to his going often to the workshop of the elder Spelman , the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 44]: He was a solemn , long-faced , and long-legged man , with reddish hair and pale complexion , who seldom or ever smiled , and at the bench always looked as if he were standing on a stool , he stooped so immoderately .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 27]: A greater contrast than that between him and the shoemaker could hardly have been found , except in this , that the carpenter also looked sickly .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 48]: He was in perfect health , however , only oppressed with the cares of his family , and the sickness of his wife , who was a constant invalid , with more children her husband thought than she could well manage , or he well provide for .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 15]: But if he had thought less about it he would have got on better .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 68]: He worked hard , but little fancied how many fewer strokes of his plane he made in an hour just because he was brooding over his difficulties , and imagining what would be the consequences if this or that misfortune were to befall him -- of which he himself sought and secured the shadow beforehand , to darken and hinder the labour which might prevent its arrival .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 15]: But he was a good man nevertheless , for his greatest bugbear was debt .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 40]: If he could only pay off every penny he owed in the world , and if only his wife were so far better as to enjoy life a little , he would , he thought , be perfectly happy .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 34]: His wife , however , was tolerably happy , notwithstanding her weak health , and certainly enjoyed life a good deal -- far more at least than her husband was able to believe .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 33]: Mr Macmichael was very kind and attentive to Mrs Spelman ; though , as the carpenter himself said , he had n't seen the colour of _ his _ money for years .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 28]: But the Doctor knew that Spelman was a hard-working man , and would rather have given him a little money than have pressed him for a penny .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 64]: He told him one day , when he was lamenting that he could n't pay him even _ yet _ , that he was only too glad to do anything in the least little bit like what the Saviour did when he was in the world -- `` a carpenter like you , Spelman -- think of that , '' added the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 12]: So Spelman was as full of gratitude as he could hold .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 12]: Except Hector Macallaster , the Doctor was almost his only creditor .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 26]: Medicine and shoes were his chief trials : he kept on paying for the latter , but the debt for the former went on accumulating .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 116]: Hence it came that when Willie began to haunt his shop , though he had hardly a single smile to give the little fellow , he was more than pleased ; -- gave him odds and ends of wood ; lent him whatever tools he wanted except the adze -- that he would not let him touch ; would drop him a hint now and then as to the use of them ; would any moment stop his own work to attend to a difficulty the boy found himself in ; and , in short , paid him far more attention than he would have thought required of him if Willie had been his apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 18]: From the moment he entered the workshop , Willie could hardly keep his hands off the tools .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 37]: The very shape of them , as they lay on the bench or hung on the wall , seemed to say over and over , `` Come , use me ; come , use me . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 9]: They looked waiting , and hungry for work .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 16]: They wanted stuff to shape and fashion into things , and join into other things .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 40]: They wanted to make bigger tools than themselves -- for ploughing the earth , for carrying the harvest , or for some one or other of ten thousand services to be rendered in the house or in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 102]: It was impossible for Willie to see the hollow lip of the gouge , the straight lip of the chisel , or the same lip fitted with another lip , and so made into the mouth of the plane , the worm-like auger , or the critical spokeshave , the hammer which will have it so , or the humble bradawl which is its pioneer -- he could see none of them without longing to send his life into theirs , and set them doing in the world -- for was not this what their dumb looks seemed ever to implore ?
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 34]: At that time young Spelman was busy making a salt-box for his mother out of the sound bits of an old oak floor which his father had taken up because it was dry-rotted .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 28]: It was hard wood to work , but Willie bore a hand in planing the pieces , and was initiated into the mysteries of dovetailing and gluing .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 36]: Before the lid was put on by the hinges , he carved the initials of the carpenter and his wife in relief upon it , and many years after they used to show his work .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 14]: But the first thing he set about making for himself was a water-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 54]: If he had been a seaside boy , his first job would have been a boat ; if he had lived in a flat country , it would very likely have been a windmill ; but the most noticeable thing in that neighbourhood was a mill for grinding corn driven by a water-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 36]: When Willie was a tiny boy , he had gone once with Farmer Thomson 's man and a load of corn to see the mill ; and the miller had taken him all over it .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 82]: He saw the corn go in by the hopper into the trough which was the real hopper , for it kept constantly hopping to shake the corn down through a hole in the middle of the upper stone , which went round and round against the lower , so that between them they ground the corn to meal , which , in the story beneath , he saw pouring , a solid stream like an avalanche , from a wooden spout .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 23]: But the best of it all was the wheel outside , and the busy rush of the water that made it go .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 8]: So Willie would now make a water-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 12]: -LSB- Illustration : WILLIE IS TAKEN TO SEE A WATER-WHEEL . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 77]: The carpenter having given him a short lecture on the different kinds of water-wheels , he decided on an undershot , and with Sandy 's help proceeded to construct it -- with its nave of mahogany , its spokes of birch , its floats of deal , and its axle of stout iron-wire , which , as the friction would not be great , was to run in gudgeon-blocks of some hard wood , well oiled .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 33]: These blocks were fixed in a frame so devised that , with the help of a few stones to support it , the wheel might be set going in any small stream .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 64]: There were many tiny brooks running into the river , and they fixed upon one of them which issued from the rising ground at the back of the village : just where it began to run merrily down the hill , they constructed in its channel a stonebed for the water-wheel -- not by any means for it to go to sleep in !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 15]: It went delightfully , and we shall hear more of it by and by .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 49]: For the present , I have only to confess that , after a few days , Willie got tired of it -- and small blame to him , for it was of no earthly use beyond amusement , and that which can only amuse can never amuse long .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 31]: I think the reason children get tired of their toys so soon is just that it is against human nature to be really interested in what is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 24]: If you say that a beautiful thing is always interesting , I answer , that a beautiful thing is of the highest use .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 35]: Is not a diamond that flashes all its colours into the heart of a poet as useful as the diamond with which the glazier divides the sheets of glass into panes for our windows ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 25]: Anyhow , the reason Willie got tired of his water-wheel was that it went round and round , and did nothing but go round .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 27]: It drove no machinery , ground no grain of corn -- `` did nothing for _ no_body , '' Willie said , seeking to be emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 33]: So he carried it home , and put it away in a certain part of the ruins where he kept odds and ends of things that might some day come in useful .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 62]: Mr Macmichael was so devoted to his profession that he desired nothing better for Willie than that he too should be a medical man , and he was more than pleased to find how well Willie 's hands were able to carry out his contrivances ; for he judged it impossible for a country doctor to have too much mechanical faculty .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 23]: The exercise of such a skill alone might secure the instant relief of a patient , and be the saving of him .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 33]: But , more than this , he believed that nothing tended so much to develop common sense -- the most precious of faculties -- as the doing of things with the hands .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 41]: Hence he not only encouraged Willie in everything he undertook , but , considering the five hours of school quite sufficient for study of that sort , requested the master not to give him any lessons to do at home .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 63]: So Willie worked hard during school , and after it had plenty of time to spend in carpentering , so that he soon came to use all the common bench-tools with ease , and Spelman was proud of his apprentice , as he called him -- so much so , that the burden of his debt grew much lighter upon his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 12]: But Willie did not forget his older friend , Hector Macallaster .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 23]: Every half-holiday he read to him for a couple of hours , chiefly , for some time , from Dick 's Astronomy .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 25]: Neither of them understood all he read , but both understood much , and Hector could explain some of the things that puzzled Willie .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 65]: And when he found that everything went on in such order , above and below and all about him , he began to see that even a thing well done was worth a good deal more when done at the right moment or within the set time ; and that the heavens themselves were like a great clock , ordering the time for everything .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 45]: Neither did he give up shoemaking , for he often did a little work for Hector , who had made him a leather apron , and cut him out bits of stout leather to protect his hands from the thread when he was sewing .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 17]: For twelve months , however , his chief employment lay in the workshop of the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 10]: WILLIE DIGS AND FINDS WHAT HE DID NOT EXPECT .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 33]: He had been reading to Hector Sir Walter Scott 's `` Antiquary , '' in which occurs the narration of a digging for treasure in ruins not unlike these , only grander .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 48]: It was of little consequence to Willie that no treasure had been found there : the propriety of digging remained the same ; for in a certain spot he had often fancied that a hollow sound , when he stamped hard , indicated an empty place underneath .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 46]: I believe myself that it came from above , and not from beneath ; for although a portion of the vaulted roof of the little chamber had been broken in , the greater part of it still remained , and might have caused a reverberation .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: The floor was heaped up with fallen stones and rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 35]: One Wednesday afternoon , instead of going to Hector , whom he had told not to expect him , he got a pickaxe and spade , and proceeded to dig in the trodden heap .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 66]: At the first blow of the pickaxe he came upon large stones -- the job of clearing out which was by no means an easy one -- so far from it , indeed , that , after working for half an hour , and only getting out two large and half a dozen smaller ones , he resolved to ask Sandy Spelman to help him .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 19]: So he left his pickaxe with one point fast between two stones , and ran to the shop .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 16]: Sandy was at work , but his father was quite willing to let him go .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 31]: Willie told them he was digging for a treasure , and they all laughed over it ; but at the same time Willie thought with himself -- `` Who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 13]: People _ have _ found treasures buried in old places like that .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 36]: The Antiquary did not -- but he is only in a story , not in a _ high story _ '' -LRB- for that was Willie 's derivation of the word _ history _ -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 7]: `` The place sounds likely enough .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: Anyhow , where 's the harm in trying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 81]: They were both so eager -- for Sandy liked the idea of digging in the ruins much better than the work he was at -- that they set off at full speed the moment they were out of the shop , and never slackened until they stood panting by the anchored pickaxe , upon which Spelman pounced , and being stronger than Willie , and more used to hard work , had soon dislodged both the stones which held it .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 52]: They were so much larger , however , than any Willie had come upon before , that they had to roll them out of the little chamber , instead of lifting them ; after which they got on better , and had soon piled a good heap against the wall outside .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 42]: After they had had their tea , they set to work again , and worked till the twilight grew dark about them -- by which time they had got the heap down to what seemed the original level of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 75]: Still there were stones below , but what with fatigue and darkness , they were now compelled to stop , and Sandy went home , after promising to come as early as he could in the morning and call Willie , who was to leave the end of a string hanging out of the staircase window , whose other end should pass through the keyhole of his door and be tied to his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 36]: He seemed to have hardly been in bed an hour , when he woke with his arm at full length , and the pulling going on as if it would pull him out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 10]: He tugged again in reply , and jumped out .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 73]: It was a lovely summer morning -- the sun a few yards up the sky ; the grass glittering with dew ; the birds singing as if they were singing their first and would sing their last ; the whole air , even in his little room , filled with a cool odour as of blessed thoughts , and just warm enough to let him know that the noontide would be hot .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 16]: And there was Sandy waiting in the street to help him dig for the treasure !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 14]: In a few minutes he had opened the street door and admitted him .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 10]: They went straight to the scene of their labour .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 36]: Having got out a few more stones , they began to fancy they heard a curious sound , which they agreed was more like that of running water than anything else they could think of .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 34]: Now , except a well in the street , just before the cottage , there was no water they knew of much nearer than the river , and they wondered a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 21]: At length Sandy 's pickaxe got hold of a stone which he could not move , do what he would .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 19]: He tried another , and succeeded , but soon began to suspect that there was some masonry there .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 37]: Contenting himself therefore with clearing out only the loose stones , he soon found plainly enough that he was working in a narrow space , around which was a circular wall of solid stone and lime .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 20]: The sound of running water was now clear enough , and the earth in the hole was very damp .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 13]: Sandy had now got down three or four feet below the level .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: `` It 's an old well , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 10]: `` There can be no doubt of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 7]: `` Does it smell bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 7]: asked Willie , peeping down disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: `` Not a bit , '' answered Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 11]: `` Then it 's not stagnant , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 18]: `` You might have told that by your ears without troubling your nose , '' said Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 9]: `` Did n't you hear it running ? ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 15]: `` How can it be running when it 's buried away down there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 14]: `` How can it make a noise if it is n't running ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 11]: retorted Sandy -- to which question Willie attempted no reply .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 55]: It was now serious work to get the stones up , for Sandy 's head only was above the level of the ground ; it was all he could do to lift some of the larger ones out of the hole , and Willie saw that he must contrive to give him some help .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 18]: He ran therefore to the house , and brought a rope which he had seen lying about .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 29]: One end of it Sandy tied round whatever stone was too heavy for him , and Willie , laying hold of the other , lifted along with him .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 22]: They got on faster now , and in a few minutes Sandy exclaimed -- `` Here it is at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 5]: `` The treasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 3]: cried Willie .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 6]: `` Oh , jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: Sandy burst out laughing , and shouted -- `` The water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 6]: `` Bother the water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 3]: growled Willie .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 23]: `` But go on , Sandy ; the iron chest may be at the bottom of the water , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 10]: `` All very well for you up there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 3]: retorted Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 18]: `` But though I can get the stones out , I ca n't get the water out .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 19]: And I 've no notion of diving where there 's pretty sure to be nothing to dive for .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 14]: Besides , a body ca n't dive in a stone pipe like this .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 18]: I should want weights to sink me , and I might n't get them off in time .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 9]: I want my breakfast dreadful , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 35]: So saying , he scrambled up the side of the well , and the last of him that appeared , his boots , namely , bore testimony enough to his having reached the water .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 35]: Willie peered down into the well , and caught the dull glimmer of it through the stones ; then , a good deal disappointed , followed Sandy as he strode away towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 18]: `` You 'll come and have your breakfast with me , Sandy , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: he said from behind him .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 10]: `` No , thank you , '' answered Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 13]: `` I do n't like any porridge but my mother 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 17]: And without looking behind him , he walked right through the cottage , and away home .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 31]: Before Willie had finished his porridge , he had got over his disappointment , and had even begun to see that he had never really expected to find a treasure .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 14]: Only it would have been fun to hand it over to his father !
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 38]: All through morning school , however , his thoughts would go back to the little vault , so cool and shadowy , sheltering its ancient well from the light that lorded it over all the country outside .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 50]: No doubt the streams rejoiced in it , but even for them it would be too much before the evening came to cool and console them ; while the slow wells in the marshy ground up on the mountains must feel faint in an hour of its burning eye .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 29]: This well had always been , and always would be , cool and blessed and sweet , like -- like a precious thing you can only think about .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 15]: And was n't it a nice thing to have a well of your own ?
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 28]: Tibby need n't go any more to the village pump -- which certainly was nearer , but stood in the street , not in their own ground .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 68]: Of course , as yet , she could not draw a bucketful , for the water hardly came above the stones ; but he would soon get out as many as would make it deep enough -- only , if it was all Sandy could do to get out the big ones , and that with his help too , how was he to manage it alone ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 5]: There was the rub !
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 17]: I must go back a little to explain how he came to think of a plan .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 42]: After Hector and he had gone as far in Dr Dick 's astronomy as they could understand , they found they were getting themselves into what seemed quite a jungle of planets , and suns , and comets , and constellations .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 22]: `` It seems to me , '' said the shoemaker , `` that to understand anything you must understand everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 43]: So they laid the book aside for the present ; and Hector , searching about for another with which to fill up the remainder of the afternoon , came upon one in which the mechanical powers were treated after a simple fashion .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 11]: Of this book Willie had now read a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 88]: I can not say that he had yet come to understand the mechanical power so thoroughly as to see that the lever and the wheel-and-axle are the same in kind , or that the screw , the inclined plane , and the wedge are the same power in different shapes ; but he did understand that while a single pulley gives you no advantage except by enabling you to apply your strength in the most effective manner , a second pulley takes half the weight off you .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 38]: Hence , with the difficulty in which he now found himself , came at once the thought of a block with a pulley in it , which he had seen lying about in the carpenter 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 59]: He remembered also that there was a great iron staple or _ eye _ in the vault just over the well ; and if he could only get hold of a second pulley , the thing was as good as done -- the well as good as cleared out to whatever depth he could reach below the water .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 32]: As soon as school was over , he ran to Mr Spelman , and found to his delight that he could lend him not only that pulley but another as well .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 14]: Each ran in a block which had an iron hook attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 31]: With the aid of a ladder he put the hook of one of the blocks through the staple , and then fastened the end of his rope to the block .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 49]: Next he got another bit of rope , and having pulled off his shoes and stockings , and got down into the well , tied it round the largest stone within reach , loosely enough to allow the hook of the second pulley to lay hold of it .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 44]: Then , as a sailor would say , he rove the end of the long rope through this block , and getting up on the ladder again , rove it also through the first block which he had left hanging to the staple .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 18]: All preparations thus completed , he stood by the well , and hauled away at the rope .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 20]: It came slipping through the pulleys , and up rose the stone from the well as if by magic .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 36]: As soon as it came clear of the edge , he drew it towards him , lowered it to the ground , took off its rope collar , and rolled it out of the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 40]: Then he got into the well again , tied the collar about another stone , drew down the pulley , thrust its hook through the collar , got out of the well , and hauled up the second stone .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 39]: In this way he had soon got out so many that he was standing far above his ankles in the water , which was so cold that he was glad to get out to pull up every stone .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 29]: By this time it was perfectly explained how the water made a noise , for he saw it escape by an opening in the side of the well .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 22]: He came at last to a huge stone , round which it was with difficulty he managed to fasten the rope .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 19]: He had to pull away smaller stones from beneath it , and pass the rope through under it .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 104]: Having lifted it a little way with the powerful help of his tackle , to try if all was right before he got out to haul in earnest , he saw that his knot was slipping , and lowered the stone again so as to set it on one end , leaning against the side of the well -- when he discovered that his rope collar had got so frayed , that one of the strands was cut through ; it would probably break and let the stone fall again into the well , when he would still more probably tumble after it .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 16]: He was getting tired too , and it was growing very dusky in the ruins .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 29]: He thought it better to postpone further proceedings , and getting out of the well , caught up his shoes and stockings , and went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 3]: A MARVEL .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 32]: Early the next morning Mr Macmichael , as he was dressing , heard a laugh of strange delight in the garden , and , drawing up the blind , looked out .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 38]: There , some distance off , stood Willie , the one moment staring motionless at something at his feet , the other dancing and skipping and singing , but still looking down at something at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 43]: His father could not see what this something was , for Willie was on the other side of one of the mounds , and was turning away to finish his dressing , when from another direction a peculiar glitter caught his eye .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 7]: `` What can this mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 6]: `` Water in the garden !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 16]: There 's been no rain ; and there 's neither river nor reservoir to overflow !
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 8]: I can hardly believe my eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 13]: He hurried on the remainder of his clothes , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 26]: But he had not gone many steps when what should he meet but a merry little brook coming cantering down between two of the mounds !
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 11]: It had already worn itself a channel in the path .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 55]: He followed it up , wondering much , bewildered indeed ; and had got to a little turfy hollow , down the middle of which it came bubbling and gabbling along , when Willie caught sight of him , and bounded to meet him with a radiant countenance and almost inarticulate cries of delight .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 7]: `` Am I awake , Willie ?
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 6]: or am I dreaming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: `` Wide awake , papa , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 9]: `` Then what is the meaning of this ?
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 17]: _ You _ seem to be in the secret : where does this water come from ?
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: I feel as if I were in a fairy tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 7]: `` Is n't it lovely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 3]: cried Willie .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 10]: `` I 'll show you where it comes from .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 3]: This way .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 7]: You 'll spoil your boots there .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 13]: Look at the rhubarb-bed ; it 's turned into a swamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 12]: `` The garden will be ruined , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 16]: `` No , no , papa ; we wo n't let it come to that .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: I 've been watching it .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 8]: There 's no soil carried away yet .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 6]: Do come and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 8]: In mute astonishment , his father followed .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 34]: As I have already described it , the ground was very uneven , with many heights and hollows , whence it came that the water took an amazing number of twists and turns .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 57]: Willie led his father as straight as he could , but I do n't know how often they crossed the little brook before they came to where , from the old stone shaft , like the crater of a volcano , it rolled over the brim , an eruption of cool , clear , lucid water .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 21]: Plenteous it rose and overflowed , like a dark yet clear molten gem , tumbling itself into the open world .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 33]: How deliciously wet it looked in the shadow I -- how it caught the sun the moment it left the chamber , grew merry , and trotted and trolled and cantered along !
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 11]: `` Is this _ your _ work , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 16]: asked his father , who did not know which of twenty questions to ask first .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 7]: `` Mostly , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 5]: `` You little wizard !
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: what have you been about ?
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 6]: I ca n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 11]: We must make a drain for it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: `` Bury a beauty like that in a drain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: cried Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: `` O papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 14]: `` Well , I do n't know what else to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 17]: How is it that it never found its way out before -- somewhere or other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 12]: `` I 'll soon show you that , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 11]: `` I 'll soon send it about its business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 106]: He had thought , when he first saw the issuing water , that the weight of the fallen stones and the hard covering of earth being removed , the spring had burst out with tenfold volume and vigour ; but had satisfied himself by thinking about it , that the cause of the overflow must be the great stone he had set leaning against the side the last thing before dropping work the previous night : it must have blocked up the opening , and prevented the water from getting out as fast as before , that is , as fast as the spring rose .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 43]: Therefore he now laid hold of the rope , which was still connected with the stone , and , not aware of how the water would help him by partly floating it , was astonished to find how easily he moved it .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 49]: At once it swung away from the side into the middle of the well ; the water ceased to run over the edge , with a loud gurgling began to sink , and sank down and down and down until the opening by which it escaped was visible .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 7]: now , now I understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 4]: cried Mr Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 20]: `` It 's the old well of the Priory you 've come upon , you little burrowing mole . ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 9]: `` Sandy helped me out with the stones .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 16]: I thought there might be a treasure down there , and that set me digging .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 12]: It was a funny treasure to find -- was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 9]: No treasure could have been prettier though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 42]: `` If this be the Prior 's Well , and all be true they said about it in old times , '' returned his father , `` it may turn out a greater treasure than you even hoped for , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 47]: Why , as I found some time ago in an old book about the monasteries of the country , people used to come from great distances to drink the water of the Prior 's Well , believing it a cure for every disease under the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 11]: Run into the house and fetch me a jug . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 13]: `` Yes , papa , '' said Willie , and bounded off .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 31]: There was no little brook careering through the garden now -- only a few pools here and there -- and its channel would soon be dry in the hot sun .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 18]: But Willie thought how delightful it was to be able to have one there whenever he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 91]: And it might be a much bigger brook too , for , instead of using the stone which could but partly block the water from the underground way , he would cut a piece of wood large enough to cover the opening , and rounded a little to fit the side of the well ; then he would put the big stone just so far from the opening that the piece of wood could get through between it and the side of the well , and so be held tight .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 23]: Then all the water would be forced to mount up , get out at the top , and run through the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 55]: Meantime Mr Macmichael , having gone to see what course the water had taken , and how it had left the garden , found that , after a very circuitous route , it had run through the hedge into a surface drain in the field , and so down the hill towards the river .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 22]: When Willie brought him the jug , he filled it from the well , and carried the water into his surgery .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 45]: There he put a little of it into several different glasses , and dropping something out of one bottle into one glass , and something out of another bottle into another glass , soon satisfied himself that it contained medicinal salts in considerable quantities .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 14]: There could be no doubt that Willie had found the Prior 's Well .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 25]: `` It 's a good thing , '' said his father at breakfast , `` that you did n't flood the house , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 15]: One turn more and the stream would have been in at the back-door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 13]: `` It would n't have done much harm , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 25]: `` It would have run along the slabs in the passage and out again , for the front door is lower than the back .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 8]: It would have been such fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 7]: `` You mischievous little thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 24]: said his mother , pretending to scold him , -- `` you do n't think what trouble you would have given Tibby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 9]: `` But would n't it have been fun ?
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 19]: And would n't it have been lovely -- running through the house all the hot summer day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 19]: `` There may be a difference of opinion about that , Master Willie , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 32]: `` You , for instance , might like to walk through water every time you went from the parlour to the kitchen , but I ca n't say I should . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 36]: Curious to know whether the village pump might not be supplied from his well , Mr Macmichael next analysed the water of that also , and satisfied himself that there was no connection between them .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 32]: Within the next fortnight Willie discovered that as often as the stream ran through the garden , the little brook in which he had set his water-wheel going was nearly dry .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 23]: He had soon made a nice little channel for it , so that it should not get into any of the beds .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 60]: He laid down turf along its banks in some parts , and sowed grass and daisy-seed in others ; and when he found a pretty stone or shell , or bit of coloured glass or bright crockery or broken mirror , he would always throw it in , that the water might have the prettier path to run upon .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 11]: Indeed , he emptied his store of marbles into it .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 37]: He was not particularly fond of playing with marbles , but he had a great fancy for those of real white marble with lovely red streaks , and had collected some twenty or thirty of them .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 15]: He kept them in the brook now , instead of in a calico bag .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 10]: The summer was a very hot and dry one .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 63]: More than any of the rest of the gardens in the village , that of The Ruins suffered from such weather ; for not only was there a deep gravel-bed under its mould , but a good part of its produce grew on the mounds , which were mostly heaps of stones , and neither gravel nor stones could retain much moisture .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 29]: Willie watered it a good deal out of the Prior 's Well ; but it was hard work , and did not seem to be of much use .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 108]: One evening , when he had set the little brook free to run through the garden , and the sun was setting huge and red , with the promise of another glowing day to-morrow , and the air was stifling , and not a breath of wind stirring , so that the flowers hung their heads oppressed , and the leaves and little buttons of fruit on the trees looked ready to shrivel up and drop from the boughs , the thought came to him whether he could not turn the brook into a little Nile , causing it to overflow its banks and enrich the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 64]: He could not , of course , bring it about in the same way ; for the Nile overflows from the quantities of rain up in the far-off mountains , making huge torrents rush into it faster than its channel , through a slow , level country , can carry the water away , so that there is nothing for it but overflow .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 32]: If , however , he could not make more water run out of the well , he could make it more difficult for what did come from it to get away .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 57]: First , he stopped up the outlet through the hedge with stones , and clay , and bits of board ; then watched as it spread , until he saw where it would try to escape next , and did the same ; and so on , taking care especially to keep it from the house .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 49]: The mounds were a great assistance to him in hemming it in , but he had hard enough work of it notwithstanding ; and soon perceived that at one spot it would get the better of him in a few minutes , and make straight for the back-door .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 19]: He ran at once and opened the sluice in the well , and away the stream gurgled underground .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: Before morning the water it left had all disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 28]: It had soaked through the mounds , and into the gravel , but comforting the hot roots as it went , and feeding them with dissolved minerals .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 50]: Doubtless , also , it lay all night in many a little hidden pool , which the heat of the next day 's sun drew up , comforting again , through the roots in the earth , and through the leaves in the air , up into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 63]: Willie could not help thinking that the garden looked refreshed ; the green was brighter , he thought , and the flowers held up their heads a little better ; the carrots looked more feathery , and the ferns more palmy ; everything looked , he said , just as he felt after a good drink out of the Prior 's Well .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 30]: At all events , he resolved to do the same every night after sunset while the hot weather lasted -- that was , if his father had no objection .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 37]: Mr Macmichael said he might try it , only he must mind and not go to bed and leave the water running , else they would have a cartload of mud in the house before morning .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 68]: So Willie strengthened and heightened his barriers , and having built a huge one at the last point where the water had tried to get away , as soon as the sun was down shut the sluice , and watched the water as it surged up in the throat of the well , and rushed out to be caught in the toils he had made for it .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 27]: Before it could find a fresh place to get out at , the whole upper part of the garden was one network of lakes and islands .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 57]: Willie kept walking round and round it , as if it had been a wild beast trying to get out of its cage , and he had to watch and prevent it at every weak spot ; or as if he were a magician , busily sustaining the charm by which he confined the gad-about creature .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 26]: The moment he saw it beginning to get the better of him , he ran to the sluice and banished it to the regions below .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 39]: Then he fetched an old newspaper , and sitting down on the borders of his lake , fashioned boat after boat out of the paper , and sent them sailing like merchant ships from isle to blooming isle .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 21]: Night after night he flooded the garden , and always before morning the water had sunk away through the gravel .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 35]: Soon there was no longer any doubt that everything was mightily refreshed by it ; the look of exhaustion and hopelessness was gone , and life was busy in flower and tree and plant .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 41]: This year there was not a garden , even on the banks of the river , to compare with it ; and when the autumn came , there was more fruit than Mr Macmichael remembered ever to have seen before .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 4]: A NEW ALARUM .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 12]: Willie was always thinking what uses he could put things to .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 47]: Only he was never tempted to set a fine thing to do dirty work , as dull-hearted money-grubbers do -- mill-owners , for instance , when they make the channel of a lovely mountain-stream serve for a drain to carry off the filth from their works .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 25]: If Dante had known any such , I know where he would have put them , but I would rather not describe the place .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 48]: I have told you what Willie made the prisoned stream do for the garden ; I will now tell you what he made the running stream do for himself , and you shall judge whether or not that was fit work for him to require of it .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 43]: Ever since he had ceased being night-nurse to little Agnes , he had wished that he had some one to wake him every night , about the middle of it , that he might get up and look out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 119]: For , after he had fed his baby-sister and given her back to his mother in a state of contentment , before getting into bed again he had always looked out of the window to see what the night was like -- not that he was one bit anxious about the weather , except , indeed , he heard his papa getting up to go out , or knew that he had to go ; for he could enjoy weather of any sort and all sorts , and never thought what the next day would be like -- but just to see what Madame Night was thinking about -- how she looked , and what she was doing .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 34]: For he had soon found her such a changeful creature that , every time he looked at her , she looked at him with another face from that she had worn last time .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 100]: Before he had made this acquaintance with the night , he would often , ere he fell asleep , lie wondering what he was going to dream about ; for , with all his practical tendencies , Willie was very fond of dreaming ; but after he had begun in this manner to make acquaintance with her , he would just as often fall asleep wondering what the day would be dreaming about -- for , in his own fanciful way of thinking , he had settled that the look of the night was what the day was dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 52]: Hence , when Agnes required his services no longer , he fell asleep the first night with the full intention of waking just as before , and getting up to have a peep into the day 's dream , whatever it might be , that night , and every night thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 36]: But he was now back in his own room , and there was nothing to wake him , so he slept sound until the day had done dreaming , and the morning was wide awake .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 20]: Neither had he awoke any one night since , or seen what marvel there might be beyond his windowpanes .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 18]: Does any little boy or girl wonder what there can be going on when we are asleep ?
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 33]: Sometimes the stars , sometimes the moon , sometimes the clouds , sometimes the wind , sometimes the snow , sometimes the frost , sometimes all of them together , are busy .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 25]: Sometimes the owl and the moth and the beetle , and the bat and the cat and the rat , are all at work .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 36]: Sometimes there are flowers in bloom that love the night better than the day , and are busy all through the darkness pouring out on the still air the scent they withheld during the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 19]: Sometimes the lightning and the thunder , sometimes the moon-rainbow , sometimes the aurora borealis , is busy .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 37]: And the streams are running all night long , and seem to babble louder than in the day time , for the noises of the working world are still , so that we hear them better .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 25]: Almost the only daylight thing awake , is the clock ticking with nobody to heed it , and that sounds to me very dismal .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 59]: But it was the look of the night , the meaning on her face that Willie cared most about , and desired so much to see , that he was at times quite unhappy to think that he never could wake up , not although ever so many strange and lovely dreams might be passing before his window .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 45]: He often dreamed that he had waked up , and was looking out on some gorgeous and lovely show , but in the morning he knew sorrowfully that he had only dreamed his own dream , not gazed into that of the sleeping day .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 23]: Again and again he had worked his brains to weariness , trying and trying to invent some machine that should wake him .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 27]: But although he was older and cleverer now , he fared no better than when he wanted to wake himself to help his mother with Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 62]: He must have some motive power before he could do anything , and the clock was still the only power he could think of , and that he was afraid to meddle with , for its works were beyond him , and it was so essential to the well-being of the house that he would not venture putting it in jeopardy .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 52]: One day , however , when he was thinking nothing about it , all at once it struck him that he had another motive power at his command , and the thought had hardly entered his mind , before he saw also how it was possible to turn it to account .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 45]: His motive power was the stream from the Prior 's Well , and the means of using it for his purpose stood on a shelf in the ruins , in the shape of the toy water-wheel which he had laid aside as distressingly useless .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 8]: He set about the thing at once .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 54]: First of all , he made a second bit of channel for the stream , like a little loop to the first , so that he could , when he pleased , turn a part of the water into it , and let it again join the principal channel a little lower down .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 9]: This was , in fact , his mill-race .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 45]: Just before it joined the older part again , right opposite his window , he made it run for a little way in a direct line towards the house , and in this part of the new channel he made preparations for his water-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 58]: Into the channel he laid a piece of iron pipe , which had been lying about useless for years ; and just where the water would issue in a concentrated rush from the lower end of it , he constructed a foundation for his wheel , similar to that Sandy and he had built for it before .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 23]: The water , as it issued from the pipe , should strike straight upon its floats , and send it whirling round .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 21]: It took him some time to build it , for he wanted this to be a good and permanent job .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 101]: He had stones at command : he had a well , he said , that yielded both stones and water , which was more than everybody could say ; and in order to make it a sound bit of work , he fetched a lump of quick-lime from the kiln , where they burned quantities of it to scatter over the clay-soil , and first wetting it with water till it fell into powder , and then mixing it with sand which he riddled from the gravel he dug from the garden , he made it into good strong mortar .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 48]: When its bed was at length made for it , he took the wheel and put in a longer axis , to project on one side beyond the gudgeon-block , or hollow in which it turned ; and upon this projecting piece he fixed a large reel .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 30]: Then , having put the wheel in its place , he asked his father for sixpence , part of which he laid out on a large ball of pack-thread .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 42]: The outside end of the ball he fastened to the reel , then threw the ball through the open window into his room , and there undid it from the inside end , laying the thread in coils on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 46]: When it was time to go to bed , he ran out and turned the water first into the garden , and then into the new channel ; when suddenly the wheel began to spin about , and wind the pack-thread on to the reel .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 85]: He ran to his room , and undressed faster than he had ever done before , tied the other end of the thread around his wrist , and , although kept awake much longer than usual by his excitement , at length fell fast asleep , and dreamed that the thread had waked him , and drawn him to the window , where he saw the water-wheel flashing like a fire-wheel , and the water rushing away from under it in a green flame .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 45]: When he did wake it was broad day ; the coils of pack-thread were lying on the floor scarcely diminished ; the brook was singing in the garden , and when he went to the window , he saw the wheel spinning merrily round .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 61]: He dressed in haste , ran out , and found that the thread had got entangled amongst the bushes on its way to the wheel , and had stuck fast ; whereupon the wheel had broken it to get loose , and had been spinning round and round all night for nothing , like the useless thing it was before .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 27]: That afternoon he set poles up for guides , along the top of which the thread might run , and so keep clear of the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 56]: But he fared no better the next night , for he never waked until the morning , when he found that the wheel stood stock still , for the thread , having filled the reel , had slipped off , and so wound itself about the wheel that it was choked in its many windings .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 37]: Indeed , the thread was in a wonderful tangle about the whole machine , and it took him a long time to unwind -- turning the wheel backwards , so as not to break the thread .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 45]: In order to remove the cause of this fresh failure , he went to the turner , whose name was William Burt , and asked him to turn for him a large reel or spool , with deep ends , and small cylinder between .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 48]: William told him he was very busy just then , but he would fix a suitable piece of wood for him on his old lathe , with which , as he knew him to be a handy boy , he might turn what he wanted for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 34]: This was his first attempt at the use of the turning-lathe ; but he had often watched William at work , and was familiar with the way in which he held his tool .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 7]: Hence the result was tolerably satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 27]: Long before he had reached the depth of which he wished to make the spool , he had learned to manage his chisel with some nicety .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 48]: Burt finished it off for him with just a few touches ; and , delighted with his acquisition of the rudiments of a new trade , he carried the spool home with him , to try once more the possibility of educating his water-wheel into a watchman .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 18]: That night the pull did indeed come , but , alas before he had even fallen asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 8]: Something seemed to be always going wrong !
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 22]: He concluded already that it was a difficult thing to make a machine which should do just what the maker wished .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 16]: The spool had gone flying round , and had swallowed up the thread incredibly fast .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 40]: He made haste to get the end off his wrist , and saw it fly through the little hole in the window frame , and away after the rest of it , to be wound on the whirling spool .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 30]: Disappointing as this was , however , there was progress in it : he had got the thing to work , and all that remained was to regulate it .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 14]: But this turned out the most difficult part of the affair by far .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 50]: He saw at once that if he were only to make the thread longer , which was the first mode that suggested itself , he would increase the constant danger there was of its getting fouled , not to mention the awkwardness of using such a quantity of it .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 47]: If the kitten were to get into the room , for instance , after he had laid it down , she would ruin his every hope for the time being ; and in Willie 's eyes sixpence was a huge sum to ask from his father .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 34]: But if , on the contrary , he could find out any mode of making the machine wind more slowly , he might then be able to shorten instead of lengthening the string .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 84]: At length , after much pondering , he came to see that if , instead of the spool , he were to fix on the axis a small cogged wheel -- that is , a wheel with teeth -- and then make these cogs fit into the cogs of a much larger wheel , the small wheel , which would turn once with every turn of the water-wheel , must turn a great many times before it could turn the big wheel once .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 38]: Then he must fix the spool on the axis of this great slow wheel , when , turning only as often as the wheel turned , the spool would wind the thread so much the more slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 17]: I will not weary my reader with any further detail of Willie 's efforts and failures .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 45]: It is enough to say that he was at last so entirely successful in timing his machine , for the run of the water was always the same , that he could tell exactly how much thread it would wind in a given time .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 50]: Having then measured off the thread with a mark of ink for the first hour , two for the second , and so on , he was able to set his alarum according to the time at which he wished to be woke by the pull at his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 69]: But if any one had happened to go into the garden after the household was asleep , and had come upon the toy water-wheel , working away in starlight or moonlight , how little , even if he had caught sight of the nearly invisible thread , and had discovered that the wheel was winding it up , would he have thought what the tiny machine was about !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 14]: How little would he have thought that its business was with the infinite !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 54]: that it was in connection with the window of an eternal world -- namely , Willie 's soul -- from which at a given moment it would lift the curtains , namely , the eyelids , and let the night of the outer world in upon the thought and feeling of the boy !
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 46]: To use a likeness , the wheel was thus ever working to draw up the slide of a _ camera obscura _ , and let in whatever pictures might be abroad in the dreams of the day , that the watcher within might behold them .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 76]: Indeed , one night as he came home from visiting a patient , soon after Willie had at length taught his watchman his duty , Mr Macmichael did come upon the mill , and was just going to turn the water off at the well , which he thought Willie had forgotten to do , when he caught sight of the winding thread -- for the moon was full , and the Doctor was sharp-sighted .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: `` What _ can _ this be now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 11]: `` Some new freak of Willie 's , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 11]: Yes ; the thread goes right up to his window !
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 18]: I dare say if I were to stop and watch I should see something happen in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 13]: But I am too tired , and must go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 12]: Just as he thought thus with himself , the wheel stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 29]: The next moment the blind of Willie 's window was drawn up , and there stood Willie , his face and his white gown glimmering in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 13]: He caught sight of his father , and up went the sash .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 5]: `` O papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 18]: he cried ; `` I did n't think it was you I was going to see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 11]: `` Who was it then you thought to see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 4]: asked his father .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: `` Oh , nobody !
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 12]: -- only the night herself , and the moon perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 13]: `` What new freak of yours is this , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: said his father , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 18]: `` Wait a minute , and I 'll tell you all about it , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 22]: Out he came in his night-shirt , his bare feet dancing with pleasure at having his father for his midnight companion .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 24]: On the grass , beside the ruins , in the moonlight , by the gurgling water , he told him all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 15]: `` Yes , my boy ; you are right , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 21]: `` God never sleeps ; and it would be a pity if we never saw Him at his night-work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 26]: -LSB- Illustration : `` ON THE GRASS , BESIDE THE RUINS , IN THE MOONLIGHT , WILLIE TOLD HIS FATHER ALL ABOUT IT . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 7]: SOME OF THE SIGHTS WILLIE SAW .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 22]: I fancy some of my readers would like to hear what were some of the scenes Willie saw on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 37]: The little mill went on night after night -- almost everynight in the summer , and those nights in the winter when the frost was n't so hard that it would have frozen up the machinery .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 18]: But to attempt to describe the variety of the pictures Willie saw would be an endless labour .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 61]: Sometimes , when he looked out , it was a simple , quiet , thoughtful night that met his gaze , without any moon , but as full of stars as it could hold , all flashing and trembling through the dew that was slowly sinking down the air to settle upon the earth and its thousand living things below .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 38]: On such a night Willie never went to bed again without wishing to be pure in heart , that he might one day see the God whose thought had taken the shape of such a lovely night .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 28]: For although he could not have expressed himself thus at that time , he felt that it must be God 's thinking that put it all there .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 28]: Other times , the stars would be half blotted out -- all over the heavens -- not with mist , but with the light of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 7]: Oh , how lovely she was !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 4]: -- so calm !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 12]: so all alone in the midst of the great blue ocean !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 6]: the sun of the night !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 16]: She seemed to hold up the tent of the heavens in a great silver knot .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 25]: And , like the stars above , all the flowers below had lost their colour and looked pale and wan , sweet and sad .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 83]: It was just like what the schoolmaster had been telling him about the Elysium of the Greek and Latin poets , to which they fancied the good people went when they died -- not half so glad and bright and busy as the daylight world which they had left behind them , and to which they always wanted to go back that they might eat and drink and be merry again -- but oh , so tender and lovely in its mournfulness !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 40]: Several times in winter , looking out , he saw a strange sight -- the air so full of great snowflakes that he could not see the moon through them , although her light was visible all about them .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 24]: They came floating slowly down through the dusky light , just as if they had been a precipitate from that solution of moonbeams .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 27]: He could hardly persuade himself to go to bed , so fascinating was the sight ; but the cold would drive him to his nest again .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 114]: Once the wheel-watchman pulled him up in the midst of a terrible thunder-storm -- when the East and the West were answering each other with alternate flashes of forked lightning that seemed to split the black clouds with cracks of blinding blue , awful in their blasting silence -- followed by great , billowy , shattering rolls of thunder , as loud as if the sky had been a huge kettledrum , on which the clubs of giant drummers were beating a terrible onset ; while at sudden intervals , down came the big-dropped rain , pattering to the earth as if beaten out of the clouds by the blows of the thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 65]: But Willie was not frightened , though the lightning blinded and the thunder deafened him -- not frightened any more than the tiniest flower in the garden below , which , if she could have thought about it , would have thought it all being done only that she might feel cooler and stronger , and be able to hold up her head better .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 21]: And once he saw a glorious dance of the aurora borealis -- in all the colours of a faint rainbow .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 38]: The frosty snow sparkled underneath , and the cold stars of winter sparkled above , and between the snow and the stars , shimmered and shifted , vanished and came again , a serried host of spears .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 33]: Willie had been reading the `` Paradise Lost , '' and the part which pleased him , boy-like , the most , was the wars of the angels in the sixth book .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 57]: Hence it came that the aurora looked to him like the crowding of innumerable spears -- in the hands of angels , themselves invisible -- clashed together and shaken asunder , however , as in the convolutions of a mazy dance of victory , rather than brandished and hurtled as in the tumult of the battle .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 35]: Another vision that would greatly delight him was a far more common one : the moon wading through clouds blown slowly across the sky -- especially if by an upper wind , unfelt below .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 115]: Now she would be sinking helpless in a black faint -- growing more and more dim , until at last she disappeared from the night -- was blotted from the face of nature , leaving only a dim memorial light behind her ; now her soul would come into her again , and she was there once more -- doubtful indeed : but with a slow , solemn revival , her light would grow and grow , until the last fringe of the great cloud swung away from off her face , and she dawned out stately and glorious , to float for a space in queenly triumph across a lake of clearest blue .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 64]: And Willie was philosopher enough to say to himself , that all this fainting and reviving , all this defeat and conquest , were but appearances ; that the moon was her own bright self all the time , basking contented in the light of her sun , between whom and her the cloud could not creep , only between her and Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 14]: But what delighted him most of all was to catch the moon dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 39]: That was when the old moon , tumbled over on her back , would come floating up the east , like a little boat on the rising tide of the night , looking lost on the infinite sea !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 6]: Dreaming she must be surely !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 75]: -- she looked nothing but dreaming ; for she seemed to care about nothing -- not even that she was old and worn , and withered and dying , -- not even that , instead of sinking down in the west , into some deep bed of dim repose , she was drifting , haggard and battered , untidy and weak and sleepy , up and up into the dazzling halls of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 26]: Did she know that his light would clothe her as with a garment , and hide her in the highest recesses of his light-filled ceiling ?
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 31]: or was it only that she was dreaming , dreaming -- sweet , cool , tender dreams of her own , and neither knew nor cared about anything around her ?
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 77]: What a strange look all the night wore while the tired old moon was thus dreaming of the time when she would come again , back through the vanishing and the darkness -- a single curved thread of a baby moon , to grow and grow to a great full-grown lady moon , able to cross with fearless gaze the gulf of the vaulted heavens -- alone , with neither sleep nor dreams to protect her !
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 31]: There were many other nights , far more commonplace , which yet Willie liked well to look out upon , but which could not keep him long from his bed .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 35]: There was , for instance , the moonless and cloudy night , when , if he had been able to pierce the darkness to the core , he would have found nothing but blackness .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 20]: It had a power of its own , but one can not say it had much to look at .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 31]: On such a night he would say to himself that the day was so sound asleep he was dreaming of nothing at all , and make haste to his nest .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 44]: Then again there was the cold night of black frost , when there was cloud enough to hide the stars and the moon , and yet a little light came soaking through , enough to reveal how hopeless and dreary the earth was .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 58]: For in such nights of cold , when there is no snow to cover them , the flowers that have crept into their roots to hide from the winter are not even able to dream of the spring ; -- they grow quite stupid and benumbed , and sleep outright like a polar bear or a dormouse .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 10]: He never could look long at such a night .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 49]: Neither did he care to look long when a loud wind was out -- except the moon was bright ; for the most he could distinguish was the trees blowing against the sky , and they always seemed not to like it , and to want to stop .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 28]: And if the big strong trees did not like it , how could the poor little delicate flowers , shivering and shaking and tossed to and fro ?
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 36]: If he could have seen the wind itself , it would have been a different thing ; but as it was , he could enjoy it more by lying in bed and listening to it .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 55]: Then as he listened he could fancy himself floating out through miles and miles of night and wind , and moon-and-star-light , or moony snowflakes , or even thick darkness and rain ; until , falling asleep in the middle of his fancy , it would thicken around him into a dream of delight .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 17]: Once there was to be an eclipse of the moon about two o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 20]: `` It 's a pity it 's so late , or rather so early , '' said Mr Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 14]: `` You , Willie , wo n't be able to see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 14]: `` Oh , yes , I shall , father , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 11]: `` I ca n't let you sit up so late .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 22]: I shall be in the middle of Sedgy Moor most likely when it begins -- and who is to wake you ?
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: I wo n't have your mother disturbed , and Tibby 's not much to depend upon .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 15]: She 's too hard-worked to wake when she likes , poor old thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 14]: `` Oh , I can be woke without anybody to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 23]: `` You do n't mean you can depend on your water-wheel to wake you at the right time , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: `` Yes , I do , father .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 43]: If you will tell me exactly when the eclipse is going to begin , I will set my wakener so that it shall wake me a quarter-of-an-hour before , that I may be sure of seeing the very first of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 18]: `` Well , it will be worth something to you , if it can do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 4]: said Mr Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 17]: `` It 's been worth a great deal to me , already , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 24]: `` It would have shown me an eclipse before now , only there has n't been one since I set it going . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 6]: And wake him it did .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 57]: While his father was riding across the moor , in the strange hush of the blotted moon , Willie was out in the garden beside his motionless wheel , watching the fell shadow of the earth passing over the blessed face of the moon , and leaving her pure and clear , and nothing the worse .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 4]: A NEW SCHEME .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 18]: I have said that Willie 's father and mother used to talk without restraint in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 16]: They had no fear of Willie 's committing an indiscretion by repeating what he heard .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 12]: One day at dinner the following conversation took place between them .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 20]: `` I 've had a letter from my mother , John , '' said Mrs Macmichael to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 18]: `` It 's wonderful how well she manages to write , when she sees so badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 26]: `` She might see well enough -- at least a great deal better -- if she would submit to an operation , said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 10]: `` At _ her _ age , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 8]: returned his wife in an expostulatory tone .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 19]: `` Do you really think it worth while -- for the few years that are left her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 12]: `` Worth while to see well for a few years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 4]: exclaimed the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 7]: `` Indeed , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 20]: `` But there 's another thing I want to talk to you about now , '' said Mrs Macmichael .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 37]: `` Since old Ann 's death , six months ago , she says she has been miserable , and if she goes on like this , it will shorten the few days that are left her .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 34]: Effie , the only endurable servant she has had since Ann , is going to leave at the end of her half-year , and she says the thought of another makes her wretched .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 29]: She may be a little hard to please , but after being used to one for so many years , it is no wonder if she be particular .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 11]: I do n't know what is to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 22]: `` I do n't know , either -- except you make her a present of Tibby , '' said her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 4]: `` John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 12]: exclaimed Mrs Macmichael ; and `` John '' burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 11]: `` You do n't think they 'd pull together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 22]: `` Two old people -- each with her own ways , and without any memories in common to bind them together !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: I 'm surprised at your dreaming of such a thing , '' exclaimed his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 20]: `` But I did n't even dream of it ; I only said it , '' returned her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 14]: `` It 's time you knew when I was joking , wifie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 9]: `` You joke so dreadfully like earnest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 13]: `` If only we had one more room in the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 6]: said the doctor , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 13]: returned his wife , eagerly , `` that would be a blessing !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 37]: And though Tibby would be a thorn in every inch of grandmamma 's body , if they were alone together , I have no doubt they would get on very well with me between them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 15]: `` I do n't doubt it , '' said her husband , still thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 11]: `` Could n't we manage it somehow , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 14]: said Mrs Macmichael , half timidly , after a pause of some duration .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 26]: `` I ca n't say I see how -- at this moment , '' answered the doctor , `` much as I should like it .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 29]: But there 's time yet , and we 'll think it over , and talk about it , and perhaps we may hit upon some plan or other .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 19]: Most things _ may _ be done ; and everything necessary _ can _ be done _ some_how .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 25]: So we wo n't bother our minds about it , but only our brains , and see what they can do for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 10]: With this he rose and went to his laboratory .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 11]: Willie rose also and went straight to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 36]: Having looked all round it thoughtfully several times , he went out again on the landing , whence a ladder led up into a garret running the whole length of the roof of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 22]: `` My room would do for grannie , '' he said to himself ; `` and I could sleep up there .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 13]: A shake-down in the corner would do well enough for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 20]: He climbed the ladder , pushed open the trap-door , crept half through , and surveyed the gloomy place .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 10]: `` There 's no window but a skylight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 18]: he said ; and his eyes smarted as if the tears were about to rush into them .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 8]: `` What _ shall _ I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 5]: Wheelie will be useless !
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 22]: -- Well , I ca n't help it ; and if I ca n't help it , I can bear it .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 19]: To have grannie comfortable will be better than to look out of the window ever so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 20]: He drew in his head , came down the ladder with a rush , and hurried off to school .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 12]: At supper he laid his scheme before his father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 9]: They looked very much pleased with their boy .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 14]: But his father said at once -- `` No , no , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 5]: It wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 23]: I 'm glad you 've been the first to think of something -- only , unfortunately , your plan wo n't work .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 7]: You ca n't sleep there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 45]: `` I 'll engage to sleep wherever there 's room to lie down ; and if there is n't I 'll engage to sleep sitting or standing , '' said Willie , whose mother had often said she wished she could sleep like Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 24]: `` And as I do n't walk in my sleep , '' he added , `` the trap-door need n't be shut . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 6]: `` Mice , Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 11]: said his mother , in a tone of much significance .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 13]: `` The cat and I are good friends , '' returned Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 12]: `` She 'll be pleased enough to sleep with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 15]: `` You do n't hit the thing at all , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 18]: `` I wonder a practical man like you , Willie , does n't see it at once .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 64]: Even if I were at the expense of ceiling the whole roof with lath and plaster , we should find you , some morning in summer , baked black as a coal ; or else , some morning in winter frozen so stiff that , when we tried to lift you , your arm snapped off like a dry twig of elder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 2]: ho !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 3]: ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 15]: laughed Willie ; `` then there would be the more room for grannie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 14]: His father laughed with him , but his mother looked a little shocked .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 18]: `` No , Willie , '' said his father again ; `` you must make another attempt .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 19]: You must say with Hamlet when he was puzzled for a plan -- ` About my brains ! '
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 10]: Perhaps they will suggest something wiser next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 25]: Willie lay so long awake that night , thinking , that _ Wheelie _ pulled him before he had had a wink of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 13]: He got up , of course , and looked from the window .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 6]: The day was dreaming grandly .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 36]: The sky was pretty clear in front , and full of sparkles of light , for the stars were kept in the background by the moon , which was down a little towards the west .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 28]: She had sunk below the top of a huge towering cloud , the edges of whose jags and pinnacles she bordered with a line of silvery light .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 50]: Now this cloud rose into the sky from just behind the ruins , and looking a good deal like upheaved towers and spires , made Willie think within himself what a grand place the priory must have been , when its roofs and turrets rose up into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 13]: `` They say a lot of people lived in it then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 12]: he thought with himself as he stood gazing at the cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 19]: Suddenly he gave a great jump , and clapped his hands so loud that he woke his father .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 10]: `` Is anything the matter , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 12]: he asked , opening Willie 's door , and peeping in .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 11]: `` No , papa , nothing , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: `` Only something that came into my head with a great bounce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 10]: -- Where did it come from , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: `` Out of that cloud there .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 8]: Is n't it a grand one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 16]: `` Grand enough certainly to put many thoughts into a body 's head , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: What did it put into yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 26]: `` Please , I would rather not tell just yet , '' answered Willie , '' -- if you do n't mind , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 8]: `` Not a bit , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 15]: Tell me just when you please , or do n't tell me at all .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: I should like to hear it , but only at your pleasure , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 6]: `` Thank you , father .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 16]: I do want to tell you , you know , but not just yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 7]: `` Very well , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 16]: Now go to bed , and sleep may better the thought before the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 16]: Willie soon fell asleep now , for he believed he had found what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 16]: He was up earlier than usual the next morning , and out in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 31]: `` Surely , '' he said to himself , `` those ruins , which once held so many monks , might manage even yet to find room for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 25]: He went wandering about amongst them , like an undecided young bird looking for the very best possible spot to build its nest in .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 22]: The spot Willie sought was that which would require the least labour and least material to make it into a room .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 38]: Before he heard the voice of Tibby , calling him to come to his porridge , he had fixed upon one ; and in the following chapter I will tell you what led him to choose it .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 41]: All the time between morning and afternoon school , he spent in the same place ; and when he came home in the evening , he was accompanied by Mr Spelman , who went with him straight to the ruins .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 42]: There they were a good while together ; and when Willie at length came in , his mother saw that his face was more than usually radiant , and was certain he had some new scheme or other in his head .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 7]: WILLIE 'S NEST IN THE RUINS .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 27]: The spot he had fixed upon was in the part of the ruins next the cottage , not many yards from the back door of it .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 18]: I have said there were still a few vaulted places on the ground-level used by the family .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 28]: The vault over the wood-house was perfectly sound and weather-tight , and , therefore , as Willie and the carpenter agreed , quite safe to roost upon .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 61]: In a corner outside , and now open to the elements , had once been a small winding stone stair , which led to the room above , on the few broken fragments of which , projecting from the two sides of the corner , it was just possible to climb , and so reach the top of the vault .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 21]: Willie had often got up to look out through a small , flat-arched window into the garden of the manse .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 52]: When Mr Shepherd , the clergyman , who often walked in his garden , caught sight of him , he always came nearer , and had a chat with him ; for he did not mind such people as Willie looking into his garden , and seeing what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 66]: Sometimes also little Mona , a girl of his own age , would be running about ; and she also , if she caught sight of Willie , was sure to come hopping and skipping like a bird to have a talk with him , and beg him to take her up , which , he as often assured her , was all but impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 22]: To this place Mr Spelman and Willie climbed , and there held consultation whether and how it could be made habitable .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 30]: The main difficulty was , how to cover it in ; for although the walls were quite sound a long way up , it lay open to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 95]: But about ten feet over their heads they saw the opposing holes in two of the walls where the joists formerly sustaining the floor of the chamber above had rested ; and Mr Spelman thought that , without any very large outlay either of time or material , he could there lay a floor , as it were , and then turn it into a roof by covering it with cement , or pitch , or something of the sort , concerning which he would take counsel with his friend Mortimer , the mason .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 35]: `` But , '' said Willie , `` that would turn it into the bottom of a cistern ; for the walls above would hold the rain in , and what would happen then ?
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 31]: Either it must gather till it reached the top , or the weight of it would burst the walls , or perhaps break through my roof and drown me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 13]: `` It is easy to avoid that , '' said Mr Spelman .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 45]: `` We have only to lay on the cement a little thicker at one side , and slope the surface down to the other , where a hole through the wall , with a pipe in it , would let the water off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 5]: `` I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 3]: cried Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 10]: `` That 's what they called a gurgoyle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 25]: `` I do n't know anything about that , '' said the carpenter ; `` I know it will carry off the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 9]: `` To be sure , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 6]: `` It 's capital . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 27]: `` But , '' said Mr Spelman , `` it 's rather too serious a job this to set about before asking the doctor 's leave .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 6]: It will cost money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 4]: `` Much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: asked Willie , whose heart sank within him .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 15]: `` Well , that depends on what you count much , '' answered Spelman .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 20]: `` All I can say is , it would n't be anything out of your father 's pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 15]: `` I do n't see how that can be , '' said Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 15]: -- Cost money , and yet be nothing out of my father 's pocket !
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 13]: _ I 've _ only got threepence ha ' - penny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 22]: `` Your father and I will talk about it , '' said the carpenter mysteriously , and offered no further information .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 19]: `` There seems to be always some way of doing a thing , '' thought Willie to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 40]: He little knew by what a roundabout succession of cause and effect his father 's kindness to Spelman was at this moment returning to him , one of the links of connection being this project of Willie 's own .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 30]: The doctor being out at the time , the carpenter called again later in the evening ; and they had a long talk together -- to the following effect .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 47]: Spelman having set forth his scheme , and the doctor having listened in silence until he had finished -- `` But , '' said Mr Macmichael , `` that will cost a good deal , I fear , and I have no money to spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 40]: `` Mr Macmichael , '' said Spelman solemnly , his long face looking as if some awful doom were about to issue from the middle of it , `` you forget how much I am in your debt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 12]: `` No , I do n't , '' returned the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 50]: `` But neither do I forget that it takes all your time and labour to provide for your family ; and what will become of them if you set about this job , with no return in prospect but the satisfaction of clearing off of an old debt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 34]: `` It is very good of you , sir , to think of that , '' said the carpenter ; `` but , begging your pardon , I 've thought of it too .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 45]: Many 's the time you 've come after what I 'd ha ' called work hours to see my wife -- yes , in the middle of the night , more than once or twice ; and why should n't I do the same ?
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 6]: Look ye here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 57]: If you 're not in a main hurry , an ' 'll give me time , I 'll do the heavy work o ' this job after six o'clock o ' the summer nights , with Sandy to help me , and I 'll charge you no more than a journeyman 's wages by the hour .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 43]: And what Willie and Sandy can do by themselves -- he 's a clever boy Sandy ; but he 's a genius Willie -- what they can do by themselves , and that 's not a little , is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 45]: And if you 'll have the goodness , when I give you the honest time , at fourpence ha ` penny an hour , just to strike that much off my bill , I 'll be more obliged to you than I am now .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 45]: Only I fear I must make you pay for the material -- not a farthing more than it costs me at the saw-mills , up at the Grange , for the carriage 'll come in with other lots I _ must _ have . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 32]: `` It 's a generous offer , Spelman , '' said the doctor , `` and I accept it heartily , though you are turning the tables of obligation upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 16]: You 'll have done far more for me than I ever did for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 17]: `` I wish that were like to be true , sir , but it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 17]: My wife 's not a giantess yet , for all you 've done for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 7]: Spelman set to work at once .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 31]: New joists were inserted in the old walls , boarded over , and covered , after the advice of Mortimer , with some cunning mixture to keep out the water .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 57]: Then a pipe was put through the wall to carry it off -- which pipe , if it was not masked with an awful head , as the remains of more than one on the Priory showed it would have been in the days of the monks , yet did it work as faithfully without it .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 29]: When it came to the plastering of the walls , Mr Spelman , after giving them full directions , left the two boys to do that between them .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 69]: Although there was no occasion to roughen these walls by clearing away the old mortar from between the stones , the weather having done that quite sufficiently , and all the preparation they wanted for the first thin coat was to be well washed down , it took them a good many days , working all their time , to lay on the orthodox three coats of plaster .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 17]: Mr Spelman had wisely boarded the ceiling , so that they had not to plaster that .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: Meantime he was preparing a door and window-frames in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 29]: The room had probably been one of the prior 's , for it was much too large and lofty for a mere cell , and had two windows .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 28]: But these were fortunately small , not like the splendid ones in the chapel and refectory , else they would have been hard to fill with glass .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 31]: `` I 'm afraid you 'll be starved with cold , Willie , '' said his father one day , after watching the boys at work for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 7]: `` There 's no fireplace . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 9]: that does n't signify , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 8]: `` Look how thick the walls are !
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 11]: and I shall have plenty of blankets on my bed .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 17]: Besides , we can easily put a little stove in , if it 's wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 23]: But when the windows were fitted and fixed , Mr Macmichael saw to his dismay that they were not made to open .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 9]: They had not even a pane on hinges .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 12]: `` This 'll never do , Willie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 10]: `` This is far worse than no chimney . ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 41]: Willie took his father by the coat , and led him to a corner , where a hole went right through the wall into another room -- if that can be called a room which had neither floor nor ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 6]: `` There , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 33]: he said ; `` I am going to fit a slide over this hole , and then I can let in just as much or as little air as I please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 18]: `` It would have been better to have one at least of the windows made to open .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 29]: You will only get the air from the ruins that way , whereas you might have had all the scents of Mr Shepherd 's wallflowers and roses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 57]: `` As soon as Mr Spelman has done with the job , '' said Willie , `` I will make them both to come wide open on hinges ; but I do n't want to bother him about it , for he has been very kind , and I can do it quite well myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 5]: This satisfied his father .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 65]: At length the floor was boarded ; a strong thick door was fitted tight ; a winding stair of deal inserted where the stone one had been , and cased in with planks , well pitched on the outside ; and now Willie 's mother was busy making little muslin curtains for his windows , and a carpet for the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 59]: In the meantime , his father and mother had both written to his grandmother , telling her how Willie had been using his powers both of invention and of labour to make room for her , and urging her to come and live with them , for they were all anxious to have her to take care of .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 41]: But , in fact , small persuasion was necessary , for the old lady was only too glad to accept the invitation ; and before the warm weather of autumn was over , she was ready to go to them .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 9]: By this time Willie 's room was furnished .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 137]: All the things from his former nest had been moved into it ; the bed with the chintz curtains , covered with strange flowers and birds ; the old bureau , with the many drawers inside the folding cover , in which he kept all his little treasures ; the table at which he read books that were too big to hold , such as Raleigh 's History of the World and Josephus ; the old oblong mirror that hung on the wall , with an outspread gilt eagle at the top of it ; the big old arm-chair that had belonged to his great-grandfather , who wrote his sermons in it -- for all the things the boy had about him were old , and in all his after-life he never could bear new furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 51]: And now his grandmother 's furniture began to appear ; and a great cart-load of it from her best bedroom was speedily arranged in Willie 's late quarters , and as soon as they were ready for her , Mrs Macmichael set out in a post-chaise to fetch her mother .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 4]: WILLIE 'S GRANDMOTHER .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 25]: Willie was in a state of excitement until she arrived , looking for her as eagerly as if she had been a young princess .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 35]: So few were the opportunities of travelling between Priory Leas and the town where his grandmother lived , that he had never seen her , and curiosity had its influence as well as affection .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 33]: Great , therefore , was his delight when at last the chaise came round the corner of the street , and began to draw up in order to halt at their door .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 69]: The first thing he caught sight of was a curious bonnet , like a black coal-scuttle upside down , inside which , when it turned its front towards him , he saw a close-fitting widow 's cap , and inside that a kind old face , and if he could have looked still further , he would have seen a kind young soul inside the kind old face .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 25]: She smiled sweetly when she saw him , but was too tired to take any further notice of him until she had had tea .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 22]: During that meal Willie devoted himself to a silent waiting upon her , watching and trying to anticipate her every want .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 65]: When she had eaten a little bread and butter and an egg , and drunk two cups of tea , she lay back in her own easy chair , which had been placed for her by the side of the parlour fire , and fell fast asleep for ten minutes , breathing so gently that Willie got frightened , and thought she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 21]: But all at once she opened her eyes wide , and made a sign to him to come to her .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 16]: `` Sit down there , '' she said , pushing a little footstool towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 11]: Willie obeyed , and sat looking up in her face .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 19]: `` So , '' she said , `` you 're the little man that can do everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 11]: `` No , grannie , '' answered Willie , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 31]: `` I wish I could ; but I am only learning to do a few things ; and there 's not one of them I can do right yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 10]: `` Do you know what they call you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 14]: `` The boys at school call me Six-fingered Jack , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 4]: said his grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 7]: `` I told you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 51]: `` I 'm glad it 's only a nickname , grannie ; but if it were n't , it would soon be one , for I 'm certain the finger that came after the little one would be so much in the way it would soon get cut off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 22]: `` Anyhow , supposing you only half as clever a fellow as you pass for , I want to try you .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 7]: Have you any objection to service ?
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 19]: I should like to hire you for my servant -- my own special servant , you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: `` All right , grannie ; here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 6]: cried Willie , jumping up .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 8]: `` What shall I do first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 15]: `` Sit down again instantly , and wait till we 've finished the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 34]: I must first have you understand that though I do n't want to be hard upon you , you must come when I call you , and do what I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 6]: `` Of course , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 14]: Only I ca n't when I 'm at school , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 10]: `` I do n't want to be told that .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 10]: And I 'm not going to be a tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 11]: But I had no idea you were such a silly !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 19]: For all your cleverness , you 've positively never asked me what wages I would give you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 9]: I do n't want any wages , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 24]: I _ like _ to do things for people ; and you 're my very own grandmother , besides , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 13]: `` Well , I suppose I must settle your wages for you .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 9]: I mean to pay you by the job .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 16]: It 's an odd arrangement for a servant , but it will suit me best .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 20]: And as you do n't ask any , I need n't pay you more than I like myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: `` Certainly not , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: I 'm quite satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 17]: `` Meantime , no engagement of a servant ought to be counted complete without earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 29]: `` I 'm quite in earnest , grannie , '' said Willie , who did not know the meaning of the word as his new mistress used it .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 4]: They all laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 18]: `` I do n't see what 's funny , '' said Willie , laughing too , however .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 25]: But when they explained to him what _ earnest _ meant , then he laughed with understanding , as well as with good will .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 26]: `` So , '' his grandmother went on , `` I will give you earnest , which , you know , binds you my servant .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 8]: But for how long , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 10]: `` Till you 're tired of me , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 40]: Only , you know , I 'm papa and mamma 's servant first , and you may have to arrange with them sometimes ; for what should I do if you were all to want me at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: `` We 'll easily manage that .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 10]: I 'll arrange with them , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 9]: And now , here 's your earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: As she spoke , she put into his hand what Willie took to be a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 12]: But when he glanced at it , he found himself mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 41]: `` Thank you , grannie , '' he said , trying not to show himself a little disappointed , for he had had another scheme in his head some days , and the shilling would have been everything towards that .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 13]: `` Do you know what grannie has given you , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: `` Yes , mother -- such a pretty brass medal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: `` Show it me , dear .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 4]: Why , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 15]: it 's no brass medal , child ; -- it 's a sovereign ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: `` No-o-o-o !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 3]: Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 4]: O grannie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 19]: he cried , and went dancing about the room , as if he would actually fly with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 25]: Willie had never seen a sovereign , for that part of the country was then like Holland -- you never saw gold money there .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 20]: To get it for him , his grandmother had had to send to the bank in the county town .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 49]: After this she would often give him sixpence or a shilling , and sometimes even a half-crown when she asked him to do anything she thought a little harder than usual ; so that Willie had now plenty of money with which to carry out his little plans .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 25]: When remonstrated with by her daughter for giving him so much , his grandmother would say -- `` Look how the boy spends it !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 9]: -- always _ doing _ something with it !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 10]: He never wastes it on sweets -- not he !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 8]: -- My Willie 's above that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 22]: The old lady generally spoke of him as if she were the chief if not the sole proprietor of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 31]: `` I 'm sure I could n't do better with it , '' she would add ; `` and that you 'll see when he comes to be a man .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 10]: He 'll be the making of you all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 12]: `` But , mother , you ca n't afford it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: `` How do you know that ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: I can afford it very well .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 25]: I 've no house-rent to pay ; and I am certain it is the very best return I can make you for your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 16]: What I do for Willie will prove to have been done for us all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 12]: Certainly Willie 's grandmother showed herself a very wise old lady .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: The wisest old ladies are always those with young souls looking out of their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 11]: And few things pleased Willie more than waiting upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 35]: He had a passion for being useful , and as his grandmother needed his help more than any one else , her presence in the house was an endless source of pleasure to him .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 6]: But his father grew anxious .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 86]: He did not like her giving Willie so much money -- not that he minded Willie having or spending the money , for he believed that the spending would keep the having from hurting him ; but he feared lest through her gifts the purity of the boy 's love for his grandmother might be injured , and the service which at first had looked only to her as its end might degenerate into a mere serving of her for the sake of her shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 13]: He had , therefore , a long talk with her about it .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 56]: She was indignant at the notion of the least danger of spoiling Willie , but so anxious to prove there was none that she agreed to the test proposed by his father -- which was , to drop all money transactions between them for a few months , giving Willie no reason for the change .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 123]: Grannie , however , being in word and manner , if possible , still kinder to him than ever -- and no wonder , seeing she could no more , for the present , let her love out at her pocket-hole -- and Willie having , therefore , no anxiety lest he should have displeased her , he soon ceased to think even of the change ; except , indeed , sometimes when he wanted a little money very much , and then he would say to himself that he was afraid poor grannie had been too liberal at first , and had spent all her money upon him ; therefore he must try to be the more attentive to her now .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 52]: So the result was satisfactory ; and the more so that , for all her boasting , his grandmother had not been able to help trembling a little , half with annoyance , half with anxiety , as she let the first few of his services pass without the customary acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 24]: she said one day , at length , triumphantly , to Mr Macmichael ; `` what do you think of my Willie now ?
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: Three months over and gone , and where are your fears ?
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 14]: I hope you will trust my judgment a little better after this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 20]: `` I 'm very glad , anyhow , you put him to the trial , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 8]: `` It will do him good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 40]: `` He wants less of that than most people , Mr Macmichael -- present company _ not _ excepted , '' said the old lady , rather nettled , but pretending to be more so than she really was .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 2]: HYDRAULICS .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 38]: The first thing Willie did , after getting his room all to himself , was to put hinges on the windows and make them open , so satisfying his father as to the airiness of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 34]: Finding himself then , as it were , in a house of his own , he began to ask his friends in the village to come and see him in his new quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 14]: The first who did so was Mrs Wilson , and Mr Spelman followed .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 44]: Hector Macallaster was unwell , and it was a month before he was able to go ; but the first day he could he crawled up the hill to the Ruins , and then up the little winding stair to Willie 's nest .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 56]: The boy was delighted to see him , made him sit in his great arm-chair , and , as the poor man was very tired with the exertion , would have run to the house to get him something ; but Hector begged for a little water , and declared he could take nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 19]: Therefore Willie got a tumbler from his dressing-table , and went to the other side of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 54]: Hector , hearing a splashing and rushing , turned round to look , and saw him with one hand in a small wooden trough that ran along the wall , and with the other holding the tumbler in a stream of water that fell from the side of the trough into his bath .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 21]: When the tumbler was full , he removed his hand from the trough , and the water ceased to overflow .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 17]: He carried the tumbler to Hector , who drank , and said the water was delicious .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 28]: Hector could not imagine how the running water had got there , and Willie had to tell him what I am now going to tell my reader .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 13]: His grandmother 's sovereign and his own hydraulics had brought it there .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 61]: He had been thinking for some time what a pleasure it would be to have a stream running through his room , and how much labour it would save poor old Tibbie ; for it was no light matter for her old limbs to carry all the water for his bath up that steep narrow winding stair to his room .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 54]: He reasoned that as the well rose and overflowed when its outlet was stopped , it might rise yet farther if it were still confined ; for its source was probably in the heart of one of the surrounding hills , and water when confined will always rise as high as its source .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 27]: Therefore , after much meditation as to how it could be accomplished in the simplest and least expensive manner , he set about it as follows .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 42]: First of all he cleared away the floor about the well , and built up the circular wall of it a foot or two higher , with stones picked from those lying about , and with mortar which he made himself .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 29]: By means of a spirit-level , he laid the top layer of stones quite horizontal ; and he introduced into it several blocks of wood instead of stones .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 61]: Next he made a small wooden frame , which , by driving spikes between the stones , he fastened to the opening of the underground passage , so that a well-fitting piece of board could move up and down in it , by means of a projecting handle , and be a more manageable sluice than he had hitherto had .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 27]: Then he made a strong wooden lid to the mouth of the well , and screwed it down to the wooden blocks he had built in .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 17]: Through a hole in it , just large enough , came the handle of the sluice .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 47]: Next , in the middle of the cover , he made a hole with a brace and centre-bit , and into it drove the end of a strong iron pipe , fitting tight , and long enough to reach almost to the top of the vault .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 48]: As soon as this was fixed he shut down the sluice , and in a few seconds the water was falling in sheets upon him , and flooding the floor , dashed back from the vault , against which it rushed from the top of the pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 19]: This was enough for the present ; he raised the sluice and let the water escape again below .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 23]: It was plain , from the force with which the water struck the vault , that it would yet rise much higher .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 51]: He scrambled now on the top of the vault , and , examining the ruins , soon saw how a pipe brought up through the breach in the vault could be led to the hole in the wall of his room which he had shown his father as a ventilator .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 13]: But he would not have a close pipe running through his room .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 8]: There would be little good in that .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 44]: He could have made a hole in it , with a stopper , to let the water out when he wanted to use it , but that would be awkward , while all the pleasure lay in seeing the water as it ran .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 67]: Therefore he got Mr Spelman to find him a long small pine tree , which he first sawed in two , lengthways , and hollowed into two troughs ; then , by laying the small end of one into the wide end of the other , he had a spout long enough to reach across the room , and go through the wall on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 17]: The chief difficulty was to pierce the other wall , for the mortar was very hard .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 23]: The stones , however , just there were not very large , and , with Sandy 's help , he managed it .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 49]: The large end of one trough was put through the ventilator-hole , and the small end of the other through the hole opposite ; their second ends met in the middle , the one lying into the other , and were supported at the juncture by a prop .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 42]: They filled up the two openings round the ends with lime and small stones , making them as tidy as they could , and fitting small slides by which Willie could close up the passages for the water when he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 39]: Nothing remained but to solder a lead pipe into the top of the iron one , guide this flexible tube across the ups and downs of the ruins , and lay the end of it into the trough .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 36]: At length Willie took his stand at the sluice , and told Sandy to scramble up to the end of the lead pipe , and shout when the water began to pour into the trough .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 29]: His object was to find how far the sluice required to be shut down in order to send up just as much water as the pipe could deliver .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 18]: More than that would cause a pressure which might strain , and perhaps burst , their apparatus .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 13]: He pushed the sluice down a little , and waited a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 9]: `` Is it coming yet , Sandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 9]: `` Not a drop , '' shouted Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 45]: Willie pushed it a little further , and then knew by the change in the gurgle below that the water was rising in the well ; and it soon began to spout from the hole in the cover through which the sluice-handle came up .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 20]: `` It 's coming , '' cried Sandy , after a pause ; `` not much , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: Down went the sluice a little further still .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 25]: `` It 's pouring , '' echoed the voice of Sandy amongst the ruins ; `` as much as ever the pipe can give .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 7]: Its mouth is quite full . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 7]: Willie raised the sluice a little .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 7]: `` How is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 3]: he bawled .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 7]: `` Less , '' cried Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 26]: So Willie pushed it back to where it had been last , and made a notch in the handle to know the right place again .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 19]: So the water from the Prior 's Well went careering through Willie 's bed-chamber , a story high .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 67]: When he wanted to fill his bath , he had only to stop the run with his hand , and it poured over the sides into it ; so that Tibbie was to be henceforth relieved of a great labour , while Willie 's eyes were to be delighted with the vision , and his ears with the sounds of the water scampering through his room .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 26]: An hour or so after , as he was finishing off something about the mouth of the well , he heard his father calling him .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 20]: `` Willie , Willie , '' he shouted , `` is this any more of your kelpie work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 8]: `` What is it , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 10]: cried Willie , as he came bounding to him .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 29]: He needed no reply when he saw a great pool of water about the back door , fed by a small stream from the direction of the woodhouse .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 12]: Tibbie had come out , and was looking on in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 13]: `` That 's Willie again , sir , '' she was saying .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 17]: `` You never can tell where he 'll be spouting that weary water at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 20]: -LSB- Illustration : TIBBIE , LOOKING ON IN DISMAY , SAID , `` THAT 'S WILLIE AGAIN . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 26]: The whole place 'll be bog before long , and we 'll be all turned into frogs , and have nothing to do but croak .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 15]: That well 'll be the ruin of us all with cold and coughs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 19]: `` You 'll be glad enough of it to-night , Tibbie , '' said Willie , laughing prophetically .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 6]: `` A likely story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 6]: she returned , quite cross .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 15]: `` It 'll be into the house if you do n't stop it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 11]: `` I 'll soon do that , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 19]: Neither he nor Sandy had thought what would become of the water after it had traversed the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 50]: There it was pouring down from the end of the wooden spout , just clearing the tarred roof of the spiral stair , and plashing on the ground close to the foot of it ; in their eagerness they had never thought of where it would run to next .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 6]: And now Willie was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 29]: Nothing was easier than to stop it for the present , which of course he ran at once to do ; but where was he to send it ?
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 78]: Thinking over it , however , he remembered that just on the other side of the wall was the stable where his father 's horses lived , close to the parson 's garden ; and in the corner , at the foot of the wall , was a drain ; so that all he had to do was to fit another spout to this , at right angles to it , and carry it over the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 33]: `` You need n't take any water up for me tonight , Tibby , '' he said , as he went in to supper , for he had already filled his bath .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 21]: `` Nonsense , Willie , '' returned Tibbie , still out of temper because of the mess at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 28]: `` Your papa says you must have your bath , and my poor old bones must ache for ` t. '' `` The bath 's filled already .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 19]: If you put in one other pailful , it 'll run over when I get into it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 15]: `` Now , do n't you play tricks with _ me _ , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 14]: I wo n't have any more of your joking , '' returned Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 44]: Nettled at the way she took the information with which he had hoped to please her , he left her to carry up her pail of water ; but it was the last , and she thanked him very kindly the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 13]: The only remaining question was how to get rid of the bath-water .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 29]: But he soon contrived a sink on the top step of the stair outside the door , which was a little higher than the wall of the stable-yard .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 17]: From there a short pipe was sufficient to carry that water also over into the drain .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 46]: I may mention , that although a severe winter followed , the Prior 's Well never froze ; and that , as they were always either empty , or full of _ running _ water , the pipes never froze , and consequently never burst .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 6]: HECTOR HINTS AT A DISCOVERY .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 21]: The next day after Hector 's visit , Willie went to see how he was , and found him better .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 37]: `` I certainly am better , '' he said , `` and what 's more , I 've got a strange feeling it was that drink of water you gave me yesterday that has done it .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 22]: I 'm coming up to have some more of it in the evening , if you 'll give it me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 20]: `` As much of it as _ you _ can drink , Hector , anyhow , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 12]: `` You wo n't drink _ my _ cow dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 16]: `` I wonder if it could be the water , '' said Hector , musingly .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 12]: `` My father says people used to think it cured them .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 25]: That was some hundreds of years ago ; but if it did so then , I do n't see why it should n't now .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 23]: My mother is certainly better , but whether that began since we found the well , I ca n't be very sure .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 21]: For Tibbie -- she is always drinking at it , she says it does her a world of good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 50]: `` I 've read somewhere , '' said the shoemaker , `` that wherever there 's a hurt there 's a help ; and when I was a boy , and stung myself with a nettle , I never had far to look for a dock-stalk with its juice .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 14]: Who knows but the Prior 's Well may be the cure for me ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 28]: It ca n't straighten my back , I know , but it may make me stronger for all that , and fitter for the general business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 38]: `` I will lay down a pipe for you , if you like , Hector , and then you can drink as much of the water as you please , without asking anybody , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 3]: Hector laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 59]: `` It 's not such a sure thing , '' he replied , `` as to be worth that trouble ; and besides , the walk does me good , and a drink once or twice a day is enough -- that is , if your people wo n't think me a trouble , coming so often . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 27]: `` There 's no fear of that , '' said Willie ; `` it 's our business , you know , to try to cure people .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 24]: I 'll tell you what -- could n't you bring up a bit of your work , and sit in my room sometimes ?
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 10]: It 's better air there than down here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 10]: `` You 're very kind , indeed , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 4]: We 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 47]: Meantime , I 'll come up morning and evening , and have a drink of the water , as long at least as the warm weather lasts , and by that time I shall be pretty certain whether it is doing me good or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: So Hector went on drinking the water and getting a little better .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 28]: Next , grannie took to it , and , either from imagination , or that it really did her good , declared it was renewing her youth .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 60]: All the doctor said on the matter was , that the salts it contained could do no one any harm , and might do some people much good ; that there was iron in it , which was strengthening , and certain ingredients besides , which might possibly prevent the iron from interfering with other functions of the system .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 27]: He said he should not be at all surprised if , some day or other , it regained its old fame as a well of healing .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 33]: Mr Spelman , in consequence of a talk he had with Hector , having induced his wife to try it , she also soon began to think it was doing her good .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 22]: Beyond these I have now mentioned , no one paid any attention to the Prior 's Well or its renascent reputation .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 5]: HOW WILLIE WENT ON .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 20]: As soon as Willie began a new study , he began trying to get at the sense of it .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 55]: This caused his progress to be slow at first , and him to appear dull amongst those who merely learned by rote ; but as he got a hold of the meaning of it all , his progress grew faster and faster , until at length in most studies he outstripped all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 59]: I need hardly repeat that the constant exercise of his mind through his fingers , in giving a second existence outside of him to what had its first existence inside him -- that is , in his mind , made it far easier for him to understand the relations of things that go to make up a science .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 76]: A boy who could put a box together must find Euclid easier -- the Second Book particularly -- than one who had no idea of the practical relations of the boundaries of spaces ; one who could contrive a machine like his water-wheel , must be able to understand the interdependence of the parts of a sentence better than one equally gifted otherwise , but who did not know how one wheel could move another .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 30]: Everything he did would help his arithmetic , and geography , and history ; and these and those and all things besides , would help him to understand poetry .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 38]: In his Latin sentences he found the parts fit into each other like dove-tailing ; finding the terms of equations , he said , was like inventing machines , and he soon grew clever at solving them .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 65]: It was not from his manual abilities alone that his father had given him the name of Gutta-Percha Willie , but from the fact that his mind , once warmed to interest , could accommodate itself to the peculiarities of any science , just as the gutta-percha which is used for taking a mould fits itself to the outs and ins of any figure .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 18]: He still employed his water-wheel to pull him out of bed in the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 47]: He had , of course , to make considerable alterations in , or rather additions to , its machinery , after changing his bed-room , for it had then to work in a direction at right angles to the former ; but this he managed perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 96]: It is well for Willie 's reputation with a certain , and that not a small class of readers , that there was something even they would call useful in several of his inventions and many of his efforts ; in his hydraulics , for instance , by means of which he saved old Tibby 's limbs ; in his house-building , too , by means of which they were able to take in grannie ; and , for a long time now , he had been doing every little repair wanted in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 18]: If a lock went wrong , he would have it off at once and taken to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 51]: If less would not do , he carried it to the smithy , but very seldom troubled Mr Willett about it , for he had learned to do small jobs , and to heat and work and temper a piece of iron within his strength as well as any man .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 69]: His mother did not much like this part of his general apprenticeship , for he would get his hands so black sometimes on a Saturday afternoon that he could not get them clean enough for church the next day ; and sometimes he would come home with little holes burnt here and there in his clothes by the sparks from the red-hot iron when beaten on the anvil .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 40]: Concerning this last evil , she spoke at length to Hector , who made him a leather apron , like Mr Willett 's , which thereafter he always wore when he had a job to do in the smithy .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 45]: It is well , I say , that the utility of such of his doings as these will be admitted by all ; for some other objects upon which he spent much labour would , by most people , be regarded as utterly useless .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 69]: Few , for instance , would allow there was any value in a water-wheel which could grind no corn , and was of service only to wake him in the middle of the night -- not for work , not for the learning of a single lesson , but only that he might stare out of the window for a while , and then get into bed again .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 14]: For my part , nevertheless , I think it a most useful contrivance .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 55]: For all lovely sights tend to keep the soul pure , to lift the heart up to God , and above , not merely what people call low cares , but what people would call reasonable cares , although our great Teacher teaches us that such cares are unjust towards our Father in Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 43]: More than that , by helping to keep the mind calm and pure , they help to keep the imagination , which is the source of all invention , active , and the judgment , which weighs all its suggestions , just .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 28]: Whatever is beautiful is of God , and it is only ignorance or a low condition of heart and soul that does not prize what is beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 44]: If I had a choice between two mills , one that would set fine dinners on my table , and one that would show me lovely sights in earth and sky and sea , I know which I should count the more useful .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 34]: Perhaps there is not so much to be said for the next whim of Willie 's ; but a part at least of what I have just written will apply to it also .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 58]: What put it in his head I am not sure , but I think it was two things together -- seeing a soaring lark radiant with the light of the unrisen sun , and finding in a corner of Spelman 's shop a large gilt ball which had belonged to an old eight-day clock he had bought .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 35]: The passage in which he set it up was so low that he had to remove the ornaments from the top of it , but this one was humbled that it might be exalted .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 35]: The very sight of it set Willie thinking what he could do with it ; for he not only meditated how to do a thing , but sometimes what to make a thing do .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 50]: Nor was it long ere he made up his mind , and set about a huge kite , more than six feet high -- a great strong monster , with a tail of portentous length -- to the top of the arch of which he attached the golden ball .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 21]: Then he bought a quantity of string , and set his wheel to call him up an hour before sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 40]: One morning was too still , another too cloudy , and a third wet ; but at last came one clear and cool , with a steady breeze which sent the leaves of the black poplars all one way .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 94]: He dressed with speed , and , taking his kite and string , set out for a grass field belonging to Farmer Thomson , where he found most of the daisies still buttoned up in sleep , their red tips all together , as tight and close as the lips of a baby that wo n't take what is offered it -- as if they never meant to have anything more to do with the sun , and would never again show him the little golden sun they had themselves inside of them .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 44]: In a few minutes the kite had begun to soar , slowly and steadily , then faster and faster , until at length it was towering aloft , tugging and pulling at the string , which he could not let out fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 23]: He kept looking up after it intently as it rose , when suddenly a new morning star burst out in golden glitter .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 11]: It was the gilt ball ; it saw the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 33]: The glory which , striking on the heart of the lark , was there transmuted into song , came back from the ball , after its kind , in glow and gleam .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 32]: He danced with delight , and shouted and sang his welcome to the resurrection of the sun , as he watched his golden ball alone in the depth of the air .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 24]: He never thought of any one hearing him , nor was it likely that any one in the village would be up yet .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 37]: He was therefore a good deal surprised when he heard the sweet voice of Mona Shepherd behind him ; and turning , saw her running to him bare-headed , with her hair flying in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 3]: `` Willie !
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 3]: Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 14]: she was crying , half-breathless with haste and the buffeting of the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: `` Well , Mona , who would have thought of seeing you out so early ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 15]: `` May n't a girl get up early , as well as a boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 24]: It 's not like climbing walls and trees , you know , though I ca n't see the harm of that either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 21]: `` No more can I , '' said Willie , `` if they 're not too difficult , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 7]: But what brought you out now ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 6]: Do you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 8]: `` May n't I stop with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 32]: I saw you looking up , and I looked up too , and then I saw something flash ; and I dressed as hard as I could , and ran out .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 7]: Are you catching the lightning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 18]: `` No , '' said Willie ; `` something better than the lightning -- the sunlight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 5]: said Mona , disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 17]: `` Why , Mona , is n't the sunlight a better thing than the lightning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 4]: said philosophical Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 16]: `` Yes , I dare say ; but you can have it any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 9]: `` That only makes it the more valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 12]: But it 's not quite true when you think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 13]: You ca n't have it now , except from my ball . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 20]: `` Oh , yes , I can , '' cried Mona ; `` for there he comes himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 21]: And there , to be sure , was the first blinding arc of the sun rising over the eastern hill .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 27]: Both of them forgot the kite , and turned to watch the great marvel of the heavens , throbbing and pulsing like a sea of flame .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 16]: When they turned again to the kite they could see the golden ball no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 30]: Its work was over ; it had told them the sun was coming , and now , when the sun was come , it was not wanted any more .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 32]: Willie began to draw in his string and roll it up on its stick , slowly pulling down to the earth the soaring sun-scout he had sent aloft for the news .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 20]: He had never flown anything like such a large kite before , and he found it difficult to reclaim .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 14]: `` Will you take me out with you next time , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 5]: asked Mona , pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 25]: `` I do so like to be out in the morning , when the wind is blowing , and the clouds are flying about .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 14]: I wonder why everybody does n't get up to see the sun rise .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 11]: Do n't you think it is well worth seeing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 6]: `` That I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 10]: `` Then you will let me come with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 12]: I like it so much better when you are with me .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 6]: Janet spoils it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 23]: Janet was her old nurse , who seemed to think the main part of her duty was to check Mona 's enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 17]: `` I will , '' said Willie , `` if your papa has no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 8]: Mona did not even remember her mamma .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 11]: She had died when she was such a little thing .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 12]: `` Come and ask him , then , '' said Mona .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 29]: So soon as he had secured Sun-scout , as he called his kite with the golden head , she took his hand to lead him to her father .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 12]: `` He wo n't be up yet , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes , long ago , '' cried Mona .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 21]: `` He 's always up first in the house , and as soon as he 's dressed he calls me .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 19]: He 'll be at breakfast by this time , and wondering what can have become of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 22]: So Willie went with her , and there was Mr Shepherd , as she had said , already seated at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 13]: `` What have you been about , Mona , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 13]: he asked , as soon as he had shaken hands with Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 16]: `` We 've been helping the sun to rise , '' said Mona , merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 28]: `` No , no , '' said Willie ; `` we 've only been having a peep at him in bed , before he got up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 10]: `` Oh , yes , '' chimed in Mona .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 8]: `` And he was so fast asleep !
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 30]: -- and snoring , '' she added , with a comical expression and tone , as if it were a thing not to be mentioned save as a secret .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 17]: But Willie did not like the word , and her father was of the same mind .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 18]: `` No , no , '' said Mr Shepherd ; `` that 's not respectful , Mona .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 22]: I do n't like you to talk that way , even in fun , of the great light of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 16]: There are more good reasons for objecting to it than you would quite understand yet .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: Willie would not talk like that , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 12]: Tell me what you have been about , my boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 26]: Willie explained the whole matter , and asked if he might call Mona the next time he went out with his kite in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 35]: Mr Shepherd consented at once ; and Mona said he had only to call from his window into their garden , and she would be sure to hear him even if she was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 44]: The next thing Willie did was to construct a small windlass in the garden , with which to wind up or let out the string of the kite ; and when the next fit morning arrived , Mona and he went out together .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 57]: The wind blowing right through the garden , they did not go to the open field , but sent up the kite from the windlass , and Mona was able by means of the winch to let out the string , while Willie kept watching for the moment when the golden ball should catch the light .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 42]: They did the same for several mornings after , and Willie managed , with the master 's help , to calculate exactly the height to which the ball had flown when first it gained a peep of the sun in bed .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 45]: One windy evening they sent the kite up in the hope that it would fly till the morning ; but the wind fell in the night , and when the sun came near there was no golden ball in the air to greet him .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 28]: So , instead of rejoicing in its glitter far aloft , they had to set out , guided by the string , to find the fallen Lucifer .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 16]: The kite was of small consequence , but the golden ball Willie could not replace .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 84]: that very evening he had added a great length of string -- so much , that when the wind ceased the kite could just reach the river , into which it fell ; and when the searchers at length drew Sun-scout from the water they found his glory had departed ; the golden ball had been beaten and ground upon the stones of the stream , and never more did they send him climbing up the heavens to welcome the lord of day .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 62]: Indeed , it was many years before Willie flew a kite again , for , after a certain conversation with his grandmother , he began to give a good deal more time to his lessons than hitherto ; and while his recreations continued to be all of a practical sort , his reading was mostly such as prepared him for college .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 7]: WILLIE 'S TALK WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: One evening in winter , when he had been putting coals on his grannie 's fire , she told him to take a chair beside her , as she wanted a little talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 5]: He obeyed her gladly .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 18]: `` Well , Willie , '' she said , `` what would you like to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 32]: Willie had just been helping to shoe a horse at the smithy , and , in fact , had driven one of the nails -- an operation perilous to the horse .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 30]: Full of the thing which had last occupied him , he answered without a moment 's hesitation -- `` I should like to be a blacksmith , grannie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 5]: The old lady smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 33]: She had seen more black on Willie 's hands than could have come from the coals , and judged from that and his answer that he had just come from the smithy .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 70]: An unwise grandmother , had she wished to turn him from the notion , would have started an objection at once -- probably calling it a dirty trade , or a dangerous trade , or a trade that the son of a professional man could not be allowed to follow ; but Willie 's grandmother knew better , and went on talking about the thing in the quietest manner .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 26]: `` It 's a fine trade , '' she said ; `` thorough manly work , and healthy , I believe , notwithstanding the heat .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 11]: But why would you take to it , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 13]: Willie fell back on his principles , and thought for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 32]: `` Of course , if I 'm to be any good at all I must have a hand in what Hector calls the general business of the universe , grannie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 34]: `` To be sure ; and that , as a smith , you would have ; but why should you choose to be a smith rather than anything else in the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 30]: `` Because -- because -- people ca n't get on without horse-shoes , and ploughs and harrows , and tires for cart-wheels , and locks , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 13]: It would help people very much if I were a smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 7]: `` I do n't doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 24]: But if you were a mason you could do quite as much to make them comfortable ; you could build them houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 6]: `` Yes , I could .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 10]: It would be delightful to build houses for people .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 6]: I should like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 12]: `` It 's very hard work , '' said his grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 14]: `` Only you would n't mind that , I know , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 11]: `` No man minds hard work , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 29]: `` I think I should like to be a mason ; for then , you see , I should be able to look at what I had done .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 38]: The ploughs and carts would go away out of sight , but the good houses would stand where I had built them , and I should be able to see how comfortable the people were in them .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 14]: I should come nearer to the people themselves that way with my work .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 15]: Yes , grannie , I would rather be a mason than a smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 14]: `` A carpenter fits up the houses inside , '' said his grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 25]: `` Do n't you think , with his work , he comes nearer the people that live in it than the mason does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 11]: `` To be sure , '' cried Willie , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 19]: `` People hardly see the mason 's work , except as they 're coming up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 9]: I know more about carpenter 's work too .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 20]: _ Yes _ , grannie , I have settled now ; I 'll be a carpenter -- there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: cried Willie , jumping up from his seat .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 27]: `` If it had n't been for Mr Spelman , I do n't see how we could have had _ you _ with us , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 5]: Think of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 25]: `` Only , if you had been a tailor or a shoemaker , you would have come still nearer to the people themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 13]: `` I do n't know much about tailoring , '' returned Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 14]: `` I could stitch well enough , but I could n't cut out .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 9]: I could soon be a shoemaker , though .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 23]: I 've done everything wanted in a shoe or a boot with my own hands already ; Hector will tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 9]: I could begin to be a shoemaker to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 7]: That is nearer than a carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 34]: `` I was going to suggest , '' said his grannie , `` that there 's a kind of work that goes yet nearer to the people it helps than any of those .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 20]: But , of course , if you 've made up your mind '' -- `` Oh no , grannie !
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 20]: I do n't mean it so much as that -- if there 's a better way , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 7]: Tell me what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 11]: `` I want you to think and find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 16]: Willie thought , looked puzzled , and said he could n't tell what it was .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 14]: `` Then you must think a little longer , '' said his grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 10]: `` And now go and wash your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIX .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 6]: A TALK WITH Mr SHEPHERD .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 23]: In a few minutes Willie came rushing back from his room , with his hands and face half wet and half dry .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 3]: `` Grannie !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 3]: grannie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 10]: he panted -- `` what a stupid I am !
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 8]: How can a body be so stupid !
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: Of course you mean a doctor 's work !
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 23]: My father comes nearer to people to help them than anybody else can -- and yet I never thought what you meant .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 18]: How is it you can know a thing and not know it at the same moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 19]: `` Well , now you 've found what I meant , what do you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 4]: said his grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 13]: `` Why , of course , it 's the best of all .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 31]: When I was a little fellow , I used to think I should be a doctor some day , but I do n't feel quite so sure of it now .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 17]: Do you really think , grannie , I _ could _ be a doctor like papa ?
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 16]: You see that wants such a good head -- and -- and -- everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 12]: `` Yes ; it does want a good head and everything .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 24]: But you 've got a good enough head to begin with , and it depends on yourself to make it a better one .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: So long as people 's hearts keep growing better , their heads do the same .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 17]: I think you have every faculty for the making of a good doctor in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: `` Do you really think so , grannie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 5]: cried Willie , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 6]: `` I do indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 11]: `` Then I shall ask papa to teach me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 15]: But Willie did not find his papa quite ready to take him in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: `` No , Willie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 23]: `` You must learn a great many other things before it would be of much use for me to commence my part .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 27]: I will teach you if you like , after school-hours , to compound certain medicines ; but the important thing is to get on at school .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 40]: You are quite old enough now to work at home too ; and though I do n't want to confine you to your lessons , I should like you to spend a couple of hours at them every evening .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 34]: You can have the remainders of the evenings , all the mornings before breakfast , and the greater parts of your half-holidays , for whatever you like to do of another sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 11]: Willie never required any urging to what his father wished .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 38]: He became at once more of a student , without becoming much less of a workman -- for he found plenty of time to do all he wanted , by being more careful of his odd moments .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 86]: One lovely evening in spring , when the sun had gone down and left the air soft , and balmy , and full of the scents which rise from the earth after a shower , and the odours of the buds which were swelling and bursting in all directions , Willie was standing looking out of his open window into the parson 's garden , when Mr Shepherd saw him and called to him -- `` Come down here , Willie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 12]: `` I want to have a little talk with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 53]: Willie got on the wall from the top of his stair , dropped into the stable-yard , which served for the parson 's pony as well as the Doctor 's two horses , and thence passed into Mr Shepherd 's garden , where the two began to walk up and down together .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 18]: The year was like a child waking up from a sleep into which he had fallen crying .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 11]: Its life was returning to it , fresh and new .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 13]: It was as if God were again drawing nigh to His world .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 90]: All the winter through He had never left it , only had , as it were , been rolling it along the path before Him ; but now had taken it up in His hand , and was carrying it for a while ; and that was how its birds were singing so sweetly , and its buds were coming so blithely out of doors , and the wind blew so soft , and the rain fell so repentantly , and the earth sent up such a gracious odour .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 21]: `` The year is coming to itself again , Willie -- growing busy once more , '' Mr Shepherd said .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' answered Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 15]: `` It 's been all but dead , and has come to life again .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 10]: It must have had the doctor to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 3]: `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 6]: What doctor , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 20]: `` Well , you know , there is but One that could be doctor to this big world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 10]: `` Yes , surely , '' returned Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 15]: `` And that brings me to what I wanted to talk to you about .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 13]: I hear your father means to make a doctor of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 8]: Is n't it good of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: `` Then you would like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 8]: `` Yes ; that I should ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: `` Why would you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 15]: `` Because I _ must _ have a hand in the general business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 13]: Willie set forth Hector Macallaster 's way of thinking about such matters .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 9]: `` Very good -- very good indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: remarked Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 17]: `` But why , then , should you prefer being a doctor to being a shoemaker ?
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 12]: Is it because you will get better paid for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 11]: `` I never thought of that , '' returned Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 39]: `` Of course I should be better paid -- for Hector could n't keep a horse , and a horse I must have , else some of my patients would be dead before I could get to them .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 12]: But that 's not why I want to be a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 10]: It 's because I want to help people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: `` What makes you want to help people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 14]: `` Because it 's the best thing you can do with yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 7]: `` Who told you that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 20]: It seems as if everybody and everything had been teaching me that , ever since I can remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 65]: `` Well , it 's no wonder it should seem as if everything taught you that , seeing that is what God is always doing -- and what Jesus taught us as the law of His kingdom -- which is the only real kingdom -- namely , that the greatest man in it is he who gives himself the most to help other people .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 29]: It was because Jesus Himself did so -- giving Himself up utterly -- that God has so highly exalted Him and given Him a name above every name .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 28]: And , indeed , if you are a good doctor , you will be doing something of what Jesus did when He was in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 15]: `` Yes ; but He did n't give people medicine to cure them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 15]: `` No ; that was n't necessary , because He was Himself the cure .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 63]: But now that He is not present with His bodily presence -- now , medicine and advice and other good things are just the packets in which He wraps up the healing He sends ; and the wisest doctor is but the messenger who carries to the sick as much of healing and help as the Great Doctor sees fit to send .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 21]: For He is so anxious to cure thoroughly that in many cases He will not cure all at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 14]: `` How I _ should _ like to take His healing about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 27]: cried Willie -- `` just as the doctors ' boys take the medicines about in baskets : grannie tells me they do in the big towns .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: I _ should _ like to be the Great Doctor 's boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 29]: `` You really think then , '' Mr Shepherd resumed , after a pause , `` that a doctor 's is the best way of helping people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 12]: `` Yes , I do , '' answered Willie , decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 15]: `` A doctor , you see , comes nearest to them with his help .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 26]: It 's not the outside of a man 's body he helps , but his inside health -- how he feels , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: Mr Shepherd again thought for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 19]: At length he said -- `` What 's the difference between your father 's work and mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: `` A great difference , of course , '' replied Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 9]: `` Tell me then what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 14]: `` I must think before I can do that , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 12]: `` It 's not so easy to put things in words !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 19]: -- You very often go to help the same people : that 's something to start with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 11]: `` But not to give them the same help . ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 6]: `` No , not quite .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 32]: And yet '' -- `` At least , I can not write prescriptions or compound medicines for them , seeing I know nothing about such things , '' said Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 34]: `` But , on the other hand , though I ca n't give them medicine out of your papa 's basket , your papa very often gives them medicine out of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 13]: `` That 's a riddle , I suppose , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 7]: `` No , it 's not .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 15]: How is it your papa can come so near people to help them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 12]: `` He gives them things that make them well again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 13]: `` What do they do with the things he gives them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 6]: `` They take them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 11]: `` Put them in their mouths and swallow them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 11]: `` Could n't they take them at their ears ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 9]: `` No , '' answered Willie , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 12]: `` Because their ears are n't meant for taking them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 13]: `` Are n't their ears meant for taking anything , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 5]: `` Only words . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 21]: `` Well , if one were to try , might n't words be mixed so as to be medicine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 8]: `` I do n't see how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 54]: `` If you were to take a few strong words , a few persuasive words , and a few tender words , might n't you mix them so -- that is , so set them in order -- as to make them a good medicine for a sore heart , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 6]: I see , I see !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 15]: Yes , the medicine for the heart must go in at the ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 4]: `` Not necessarily .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 8]: It might go in at the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 25]: Jesus gave it at the eyes , for doubting hearts , when He said -- Consider the lilies , -- consider the ravens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 32]: `` At the ears , too , though , '' said Willie ; `` just as papa sometimes gives a medicine to be taken and to be rubbed in both . ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 23]: `` Only the ears could have done nothing with the words if the eyes had n't taken in the things themselves first .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 11]: But where does this medicine go to , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 19]: `` I suppose it must go to the heart , if that 's the place wants healing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 16]: `` Does it go to what a doctor would call the heart , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 26]: `` No , no ; it must go to what -- to what a clergyman -- to what _ you _ call the heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 12]: `` And which heart is nearer to the person himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 21]: Willie thought for a moment , then answered , merrily -- the doctor 's heart , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 25]: `` No , Willie ; you 're wrong there , '' said Mr Shepherd , looking , as he felt , a little disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 15]: said Willie ; `` I 'm almost sure I 'm right this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 20]: `` No , Willie ; what the clergyman calls the heart is the nearest to the man himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' persisted Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 16]: `` The heart you 've got to do with _ is _ the man himself .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 15]: So of course the doctor 's heart is the nearer to the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 9]: Mr Shepherd laughed a low , pleasant laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 8]: `` You 're quite right , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 8]: You 've got the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: I 'm very pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 29]: But then , Willie , does n't it strike you that after all there might be a closer way of helping men than the doctor 's way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 6]: Again Willie thought a while .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 29]: `` There would be , '' he said , at length , `` if you could give them medicine to make them happy when they are miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 33]: `` Even the doctor can do a little at that , '' returned Mr Shepherd ; `` for when in good health people are much happier than when they are ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 21]: `` If you could give them what would make them good when they are bad then , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 9]: `` Ah , there you have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 4]: rejoined Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 12]: `` That is the very closest way of helping men . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 22]: `` But nobody can do that -- nobody can make a bad man good -- but God , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 24]: But He uses medicines ; and He sends people about with them , just like the doctors ' boys you were speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 9]: What else am _ I _ here for ?
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 15]: I 've been carrying His medicines about for a good many years now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 21]: `` Then _ your _ work and not my father 's comes nearest to people to help them after all !
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 38]: My father 's work , I see , does n't help the very man himself ; it only helps his body -- or at best his happiness : it does n't go deep enough to touch himself .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: But yours helps the very man .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 8]: Yours is the best after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 13]: `` I do n't know , '' returned Mr Shepherd , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 16]: `` It depends , I think , on the kind of preparation gone through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 5]: `` Oh yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 10]: `` You had to go through the theological classes .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 9]: I must of course take the medical . ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 17]: `` That 's true , but it 's not true enough , '' said Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 13]: `` That would n't make a fraction of the difference I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 19]: There 's just one preparation essential for a man who would carry about the best sort of medicines .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 7]: Can you think what it is ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 10]: It 's not necessary for the other sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 11]: `` The man must be good , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 8]: `` I suppose that 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 14]: `` That does n't make the difference exactly , '' returned Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 17]: `` It is as necessary for a doctor to be good as for a parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' said Willie ; `` but though the doctor were a bad man , his medicines might be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 11]: `` Not by any means so likely to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 4]: said the parson .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 19]: `` You can never be sure that anything a bad man has to do with will be good .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 20]: It may be , because no man is all bad ; but you ca n't be sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 7]: We are coming nearer it now .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 21]: Might n't the parson 's medicines be good if he were bad just as well as the doctor 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 12]: `` Less likely still , I think , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 38]: `` The words might be all of the right sort , but they would be like medicines that had lain in his drawers or stood in his bottles till the good was all out of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 24]: `` You 're coming very near to the difference of preparation I wanted to point out to you , '' said Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 48]: `` It is this : that the physician of men 's _ selves _ , commonly called _ souls _ , must have taken and must keep taking the medicine he carries about with him ; while the less the doctor wants of his the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 38]: `` I see , I see , '' cried Willie , whom a fitting phrase , or figure , or form of expressing a thing , pleased as much as a clever machine -- `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 5]: It 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 5]: I understand now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 22]: `` But , '' Mr Shepherd went on , `` your father carries about both sorts of medicines in his basket .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 42]: He is such a healthy man that I believe he very seldom uses any of his own medicines ; but he is always taking some of the other sort , and that 's what makes him fit to carry them about .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 12]: He does far more good among the sick than I can .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 32]: Many who do n't like my medicine , will yet take a little of it when your father mixes it with his , as he has a wonderful art in doing .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 25]: I hope , when your turn comes , you will be able to help the very man himself , as your father does . ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 19]: `` Do you want me to be a doctor of _ your _ kind , Mr Shepherd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 21]: It is a very wrong thing to take up that basket without being told by Him who makes the medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 26]: If He wants a man to do so , He will let him know -- He will call him and tell him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 54]: But everybody ought to take the medicine , for everybody needs it ; and the happy thing is , that , as soon as anyone has found how good it is -- food and wine and all upholding things in one -- he becomes both able and anxious to give it to others .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 25]: If you would help people as much as your father does , you must begin by taking some of the real medicine yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 11]: This conversation gave Willie a good deal to think about .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 45]: And he had much need to think about it , for soon after this he left his father 's house for the first time in his life , and went to a great town , to receive there a little further preparation for college .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 58]: The next year he gained a scholarship , or , as they call it there , a _ bursary _ , and was at once fully occupied with classics and mathematics , hoping , however , the next year , to combine with them certain scientific studies bearing less indirectly upon the duties of the medical man .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 12]: HOW WILLIE DID HIS BEST TO MAKE A BIRD OF AGNES .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 21]: During the time he was at college , he did often think of what Mr Shepherd had said to him .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 69]: When he was tempted to any self-indulgence , the thought would always rise that this was not the way to become able to help people , especially the real selves of them ; and , when amongst the medical students , he could not help thinking how much better doctors some of them would make if they would but try the medicine of the other basket for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 45]: He thought this especially when he saw that they cared nothing for their patients , neither had any desire to take a part in the general business for the work 's sake , but only wanted a practice that they might make a living .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 27]: For such are nearly as unfit to be healers of the body , as mere professional clergymen to be healers of broken hearts and wounded minds .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 93]: To do a man good in any way , you must sympathise with him -- that is , know what he feels , and reflect the feeling in your own mirror ; and to be a good doctor , one must love to heal ; must honour the art of the physician and rejoice in it ; must give himself to it , that he may learn all of it that he can -- from its root of love to its branches of theory , and its leaves and fruits of healing .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 48]: He always came home to Priory Leas for the summer intervals , when you may be sure there was great rejoicing -- loudest on the part of Agnes , who was then his constant companion , as much so , at least , as she was allowed .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 66]: Willie saw a good deal of Mona Shepherd also , who had long been set free from the oppressive charge of Janet , and was now under the care of a governess , a wise , elderly lady ; and as she was a great friend of Mrs Macmichael , the two families were even more together now than they had been in former years .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 40]: Of course , while at college he had no time to work with his hands : all his labour there must be with his head ; but when he came home he had plenty of time for both sorts .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 54]: He spent a couple of hours before breakfast in the study of physiology ; after breakfast , another hour or two either in the surgery , or in a part of the ruins which he had roughly fitted up for a laboratory with a bench , a few shelves , and a furnace .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 46]: His father , however , did not favour his being in the latter for a long time together ; for young experimenters are commonly careless , and will often neglect proper precautions -- breathing , for instance , many gases they ought not to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 33]: He was so careful over Agnes , however , that often he would not let her in at all ; and when he did , he generally confined himself to her amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 8]: He would show her such lovely things !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 41]: -- for instance , liquids that changed from one gorgeous hue to another ; bubbles that burst into flame , and ascended in rings of white revolving smoke ; light so intense , that it seemed to darken the daylight .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 85]: Sometimes Mona would be of the party , and nothing pleased Agnes or her better than such wonderful things as these ; while Willie found it very amusing to hear Agnes , who was sharp enough to pick up not a few of the chemical names , dropping the big words from her lips as if she were on the most familiar terms with the things they signified -- _ phosphuretted hydrogen , metaphosphoric acid , sesquiferrocyanide of iron _ , and such like .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 92]: Then he would give an hour to preparation for the studies of next term ; after which , until their early dinner , he would work at his bench or turning-lathe , generally at something for his mother or grandmother ; or he would do a little mason-work amongst the ruins , patching and strengthening , or even buttressing , where he thought there was most danger of further fall -- for he had resolved that , if he could help it , not another stone should come to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 41]: In this , his first summer at home from college , he also fitted up a small forge -- in a part of the ruins where there was a wide chimney , whose vent ran up a long way unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 65]: Here he constructed a pair of great bellows , and set up an old anvil , which he bought for a trifle from Mr Willett ; and here his father actually trusted him to shoe his horses ; nor did he ever find a nail of Willie 's driving require to be drawn before the shoe had to give place to a new one .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 50]: In the afternoon , he always read history , or tales , or poetry ; and in the evening did whatever he felt inclined to do -- which brings me to what occupied him the last hours of the daylight , for a good part of this first summer .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 39]: One lovely evening in June , he came upon Agnes , who was now eight years old , lying under the largest elm of a clump of great elms and Scotch firs at the bottom of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 19]: They were the highest trees in all the neighbourhood , and his father was very fond of them .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 46]: To look up into those elms in the summer time your eyes seemed to lose their way in a mist of leaves ; whereas the firs had only great , bony , bare , gaunt arms , with a tuft of bristles here and there .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 20]: But when a ray of the setting sun alighted upon one of these firs it shone like a flamingo .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 32]: It seemed as if the surly old tree and the gracious sunset had some secret between them , which , as often as they met , broke out in ruddy flame .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 31]: Now Agnes was lying on the thin grass under this clump of trees , looking up into their mystery -- and -- what else do you think she was doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 29]: -- She was sucking her thumb -- her custom always when she was thoughtful ; and thoughtful she seemed now , for the tears were in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 10]: `` What is the matter with my pet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 49]: But instead of jumping up and flinging her arms about him , she only looked at him , gave a little sigh , drew her thumb from her mouth , pointed with it up into the tree , and said , `` I ca n't get up there !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 17]: I wish I was a bird , '' and put her thumb in her mouth again .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 42]: `` But if you were a bird , you would n't be a girl , you know , and you would n't like that , '' said Willie -- `` at least _ I _ should n't like it . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: _ I _ should n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 13]: I would rather have wings and fly about in the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 12]: `` If you had wings you could n't have arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 8]: `` I 'd rather have wings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 22]: `` If you were a bird up there , you would be sure to wish you were a girl down here .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 21]: For if you were a bird you could n't lie in the grass and look up into the tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 8]: `` Oh yes , I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 51]: `` What a comical little bird you would look then -- lying on your little round feathery back , with wings spread out to keep you from rolling over , and little sparkling eyes , one on each side of such a long beak , staring up into the tree !
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 3]: -- Miaw !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 2]: Miaw !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 10]: Here comes the cat to eat you up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 13]: Agnes sprang to her feet in terror , and rushed to Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 21]: She had so fully fancied herself a bird that the very mention of the cat had filled her with horror .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 23]: Once more she took her thumb from her mouth to give a little scream , and did not put it in again .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 4]: `` O Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 6]: you frightened me so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: she said -- joining , however , in his laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 5]: `` Poor birdie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 8]: `` Did the naughty puss frighten it ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 5]: Stwoke its fedders den .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 16]: -- Stwoke it -- stwoke it , '' he continued , smoothing down her hair .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 29]: `` But _ would n't _ it be nice , '' persisted Agnes , `` to be so tall as the birds can make themselves with their wings ?
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 14]: Fancy having your head up there in the green leaves -- so cool !
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 28]: and hearing them all whisper , whisper , about your ears , and being able to look down on people 's heads , you know , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 8]: I do wish I was a bird !
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 4]: I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 17]: But with Willie to comfort and play with her , she soon forgot her soaring ambition .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 9]: Willie , however , did not forget it .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 23]: If Agnes wished to enjoy the privacy of the leaves up in the height of the trees , why should n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 15]: At least , why should n't she if he could help her to it .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 53]: Certainly he could n't change her arms into wings , or cover her with feathers , or make her bones hollow so that the air might get all through her , even into her quills ; but he could get her up into the tree , and even something more , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 28]: He would see about it -- that is , he would think about it , for how it was to be done he did not yet see .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 25]: Long ago , almost the moment he arrived , he had set his wheel in order , and got his waking-machine into working trim .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 83]: And now more than ever he enjoyed being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night -- especially in the fine weather ; for then , in that hushed hour when the night is just melting into the morn , and the earth looks as if she were losing her dreams , yet had not begun to recognise her own thoughts , he would not unfrequently go out into the garden , and wander about for a few thoughtful minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 19]: The same night , when his wheel pulled him , he rose and went out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 11]: The night was at odds with morning which was which .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 41]: An occasional bat would flit like a doubtful shadow across his eyes , but a cool breath of air was roaming about as well , which was not of the night at all , but plainly belonged to the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 48]: He wandered to the bottom of the garden -- to the clump of trees , lay down where Agnes had been lying the night before , and thought and thought until he felt in himself how the child had felt when she longed to be a bird .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 8]: What could he do to content her ?
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 50]: He knew every bough of the old trees himself , having scrambled over them like a squirrel scores of times ; but even if he could get Agnes up the bare bole of an elm or fir , he could not trust her to go scrambling about the branches .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 19]: On the other hand , wherever he could go , he could surely somehow help Agnes to go .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 13]: Having gathered a thought or two , he went back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 44]: The very next evening he set to work and spent the whole of that and the following at his bench , planing , and shaping , and generally preparing for a construction , the plan of which was now clear in his head .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 40]: At length , on the third evening , he carried half a dozen long poles , and wheeled several barrowfuls of short planks , measuring but a few inches over two feet , down to the clump of trees .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 58]: At the foot of the largest elm he began to dig , with the intention of inserting the thick end of one of the poles ; but he soon found it impossible to get half deep enough , because of the tremendous roots of the tree , and giving it up , thought of a better plan .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 24]: He set off to the smithy , and bought of Mr Willett some fifteen feet of iron rod , with a dozen staples .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 33]: Carrying them home to his small forge , he cut the rod into equal lengths of a little over two feet , and made a hook at both ends of each length .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 89]: Then he carried them down to the elm , and drove six of the staples into the bole of the tree at equal distances all round it , a foot from the ground ; the others he drove one into each of the six poles , a foot from the thick end ; after which he connected the poles with the tree , each by a hooked rod and its corresponding staples , when the tops of the poles just reached to the first fork of the elm .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 37]: Then he nailed a bracket to the tree , at the height of an easy step from the ground , and at the same height nailed a piece of wood across between two of the poles .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 26]: Resting on the bracket and this piece of wood , he laid the first step of a stair , and fastened it firmly to both .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 47]: Another bracket a little higher , and another piece of wood nailed to two poles , raised the next step ; and so he went round and round the tree in an ascending spiral , climbing on the steps already placed to fix others above them .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 27]: Encircling the tree some four or five times , for he wanted the ascent easy for little feet , he was at length at its fork .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 17]: There he laid a platform or landing-place , and paused to consider what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 14]: This was on the third evening from the laying of the first step .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 47]: From the fork many boughs rose and spread -- amongst them two very near each other , between which he saw how , by help of various inequalities , he might build a little straight staircase leading up into a perfect wilderness of leaves and branches .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 41]: He set about it at once , and , although he found it more difficult than he had expected , succeeded at last in building a safe stair between the boughs , with a hand-rail of rope on each side .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 37]: But Willie had chosen to ascend in this direction for another reason as well : one of these boughs was in close contact with a bough belonging to one of the largest of the red firs .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 25]: On this fir-bough he constructed a landing-place , upon which it was as easy as possible to step from the stair in the elm .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 26]: Next , the bough being very large , he laid along it a plank steadied by blocks underneath -- a level for the little feet .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 75]: Then he began to weave a network of rope and string along each side of the bough , so that the child could not fall off ; but finding this rather a long job , and thinking it a pity to balk her of so much pleasure merely for the sake of surprising her the more thoroughly , he resolved to reveal what he had already done , and permit her to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 36]: For , as I ought to have mentioned sooner , he had taken Mona into his confidence , and she had kept Agnes out of the way for now nearly a whole week of evenings .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 43]: But she was finding it more and more difficult to restrain her from rushing off in search of Willie , and was very glad indeed when he told her that he was not going to keep the thing a secret any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 19]: -LSB- Illustration : WILLIE CARRIED AGNES UP THE STAIR INTO THE GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ELM TREE . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 7]: HOW AGNES LIKED BEING A BIRD .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 37]: But Willie began to think whether he might not give Agnes two surprises out of it , with a dream into the bargain , and thought over it until he saw how he could manage it .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 32]: She always went to bed at seven o'clock , so that by the time the other people in the house began to think of retiring , she was generally fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 107]: About ten o'clock , therefore , the next night , just as a great round moon was peering above the horizon , with a quantity of mackerel clouds ready to receive her when she rose a yard or two higher , Willie , taking a soft shawl of his mother 's , went into Agnes 's room , and having wrapped her in the shawl , with a corner of it over her head and face , carried her out into the garden , down to the trees , and up the stair into the midst of the great boughs and branches of the elm tree .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 26]: It was a very warm night , with a soft breath of south wind blowing , and there was no risk of her taking cold .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 26]: He uncovered her face , but did not wake her , leaving that to the change of her position and the freshness of the air .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 5]: Nor was he disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 50]: In a few moments she began to stir , then half-opened her eyes , then shut them , then opened them again , then rubbed them , then drew a deep breath , and then began to lift her head from Willie 's shoulder , and look about her .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 29]: Through the thick leaves the moon was shining like a great white fire , and must have looked to her sleepy eyes almost within a yard of her .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 34]: Even if she had not been half asleep , so beheld through the leaves , it would have taken her a while to make up her mind what the huge bright thing was .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 36]: Then she heard a great fluttering as if the leaves were talking to her , and out of them came a soft wind that blew in her face , and felt very sweet and pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 16]: She rubbed her eyes again , but could not get the sleep out of them .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 40]: As last she said to Willie , who stood as still as a stone -- but her tongue and her voice and her lips could hardly make the words she wanted them to utter : `` Am I awake ?
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 4]: Am I dreaming ?
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 6]: It 's so nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 16]: Willie did not answer her , and the little head sunk on his shoulder again .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 18]: He drew the corner of the shawl over it , and carried her back to her bed .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 49]: When he had laid her down , she opened her eyes wide , stared him in the face for a moment , as if she knew all about everything except just what she was looking at , put her thumb in her mouth , and was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 30]: The next morning at breakfast , her papa out , and her mamma not yet come down , she told Willie that she had had such a beautiful dream !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 39]: -- that an angel , with great red wings , came and took her in his arms , and flew up and up with her to a cloud that lay close by the moon , and there stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 72]: The cloud was made all of little birds that kept fluttering their wings and talking to each other , and the fluttering of their wings made a wind in her face , and the wind made her very happy , and the moon kept looking through the birds quite close to them , and smiling at her , and she saw the face of the man in the moon quite plain .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 61]: But then it grew dark and began to thunder , and the angel went down very fast , and the thunder was the clapping of his big red wings , and he flew with her into her mamma 's room , and laid her down in her crib , and when she looked at him he was so like Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 20]: `` Do you think the dream could have come of your wishing to be a bird , Agnes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 3]: asked Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 6]: Perhaps , '' replied Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 16]: `` Are you angry with me for wishing I was a bird , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 5]: `` No , darling .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 9]: What makes you ask such a question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 24]: `` Because ever since then you wo n't let me go with you -- when you are doing things , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 13]: `` Why , you were in the laboratory with me yesterday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 3]: said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 23]: `` Yes , but you would n't have me in the evening when you used to let me be with you always .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 14]: What are you doing down amongst the trees _ always _ now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 23]: `` If you will have patience and not go near them all day , I will show you in the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 16]: Agnes promised ; and Willie gave the whole day to getting things on a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 37]: Amongst other things he wove such a network along the bough of the Scotch fir , that it was quite safe for Agnes to walk on it down to the great red hole of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 35]: There he was content to make a pause for the present , constructing first , however , a little chair of bough and branch and rope and twig in which she could safely sit .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 24]: Just as he had finished the chair , he heard her voice calling , in a tone that grew more and more pitiful .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 3]: `` Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 3]: -- Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 3]: -- Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 4]: -- Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 9]: He got down and ran to find her .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 29]: She was at the window of his room , where she had gone to wait till he called her , but her patience had at last given way .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 10]: `` I 'm _ so _ tired , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 7]: May n't I come yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 22]: `` Wait just one moment more , '' said Willie , and ran to the house for his mother 's shawl .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 40]: As soon as he began to wrap it about her , Agnes said , thoughtfully -- `` Somebody did that to me before -- not long ago -- I remember : it was the angel in my dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 19]: When Willie put the corner over her face , she said , `` He did that too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 18]: and when he took her in his arms , she said , `` He did that too !
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 15]: How funny you should do just what the angel did in my dream ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 63]: Willie ran about with her here and there through the ruins , into the house , up and down the stairs , and through the garden in many directions , until he was satisfied he must have thoroughly bewildered her as to whereabouts they were , and then at last sped with her up the stair to the fork of the elm-tree .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 13]: There he threw back the shawl , and told her to look .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 104]: To see her first utterly bewildered expression -- then the slow glimmering dawn of intelligence , as she began to understand where she was -- next the gradual rise of light in her face as if it came there from some spring down below , until it broke out in a smile all over it , when at length she perceived that this was what he had been working at , and why he would n't have her with him -- gave Willie all the pleasure he had hoped for -- quite satisfied him , and made him count his labour well rewarded .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 4]: `` O Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 2]: Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 6]: it was all for me !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 7]: -- Was n't it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 12]: `` Yes , it was , pet , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 16]: `` It was all to make a bird of me -- was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 4]: she went on .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 12]: `` Yes -- as much of a bird as I could .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 35]: I could n't give you wings , you know , and I had n't any of my own to fly up with you to the moon , as the angel in your dream did .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 11]: The dream was much nicer -- was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: `` I 'm not sure about that -- really I 'm not .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 36]: I think it is nicer to have a wind coming you do n't know from where , and making all the leaves flutter about , than to have the wings of birdies making the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 13]: And I do n't care about the man in the moon much .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 10]: He 's not so nice as you , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 21]: And yon red ray of the sun through there on the fir-tree is as good nearly as the moon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: but you may have the moon , if you wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 10]: She 'll be too late to-night , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 27]: `` But now I think of it , Willie , '' said Agnes , `` I do believe it was n't a dream at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 18]: `` Do you think a real angel carried you really up to the moon , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 3]: asked Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 30]: `` No ; but a real Willie carried me really up into this tree , and the moon shone through the leaves , and I thought they were birds .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 17]: You 're my angel , Willie , only better to me than twenty hundred angels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 14]: And Agnes threw her arms round his neck and hugged and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 77]: As soon as he could speak , that is , as soon as she ceased choking him , he said -- `` You _ were _ up in this tree last night : and the wind was fluttering the leaves ; and the moon was shining through them '' -- `` And you carried me in this shawl , and that was the red wings of the angel , '' cried Agnes , dancing with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 10]: `` Yes , pet , I daresay it was .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 12]: But are n't you sorry to lose your big angel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 16]: `` The angel was only in a dream , and you 're here , Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 29]: Besides , you 'll be a big angel some day , Willie , and then you 'll have wings , and be able to fly me about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 20]: `` But you 'll have wings of your own then , and be able to fly without me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 15]: `` But I _ may _ fold them up sometimes -- may n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 20]: for it would be much nicer to be carried by _ your _ wings -- sometimes , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 6]: Look , look , Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 17]: Look at the sunbeam on the trunk of the fir -- how red it 's got .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 12]: I do wish I could have a peep at the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 5]: Where can he be ?
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 19]: I should see him if I were to go into his beam there -- should n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 15]: `` He 's shining past the end of the cottage , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 10]: `` Go , and you 'll see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 5]: `` Go where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 3]: asked Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 10]: `` Into the red sunbeam on the fir-tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 12]: `` I have n't got my wings yet , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 24]: `` That 's what people very often say when they 're not inclined to try what they can do with their legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 11]: `` But I ca n't go there , Willie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 7]: `` You have n't tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: `` How am I to try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 9]: `` You 're not even trying to try .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 12]: You 're standing talking , and saying you ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 12]: It was nearly all Agnes could do to keep from crying .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 14]: But she felt she must do something more lest Willie should be vexed .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 29]: There seemed but one way to get nearer to the sunbeam , and that was to go down this tree and run to the foot of the other .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 11]: What if Willie had made a stair up it also ?
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 45]: But as she turned to see how she was to go down , for she had been carried up blind , she caught sight of the straight staircase between the two boughs , and , with a shriek of delight , up she ran .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 5]: `` Gently , gently !
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 20]: Do n't bring the tree down with your tremendous weight , '' cried Willie , following her close behind .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 30]: At the end of the stairs she sprang upon the bough of the fir , and in a moment more was sitting in the full light of the sunset .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 4]: `` O Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 2]: Willie !
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 6]: this _ is _ grand !
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 8]: How good , how kind of you !
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 10]: You _ have _ made a bird of me !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 7]: What will papa and mamma say ?
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: Wo n't they be delighted ?
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: I must run and fetch Mona . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 27]: So saying she hurried across again , and down the stair , and away to look for Mona Shepherd , shouting with delight as she ran .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 29]: In a few minutes her cries had gathered the whole house to the bottom of the garden , as well as Mr Shepherd and Mona and Mrs Hunter .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 48]: Mr Macmichael and all of them went up into the tree , Mr Shepherd last and with some misgivings ; for , having no mechanical faculty himself , he could not rightly value Willie 's , and feared that he might not have made the stair safe .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 21]: But Mr Macmichael soon satisfied him , showing him how strong and firm Willie had made every part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 32]: The next evening , Willie went on with his plan , which was to make a way for Bird Agnes from one tree to another over the whole of the clump .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 38]: It took him many evenings , however , to complete it , and a good many more to construct in the elm tree a thin wooden house cunningly perched upon several of the strongest boughs and branches .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 8]: He called it Bird Agnes 's Nest .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 31]: It had doors and windows , and several stories in it , only the upper stories did not rest on the lower , but upon higher branches of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 15]: To two of these he made stairs , and a rope-ladder to a third .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 41]: When the house was finished , he put a little table in the largest room , and having got some light chairs from the house , asked his father and mother and grandmother to tea in Bird Agnes 's Nest .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 9]: But grannie declined to go up the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: She said _ her _ climbing days were over long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 5]: WILLIE 'S PLANS BUD .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 47]: Either they were over , or were only beginning ; for , the next winter , while Willie was at college , grannie was taken ill ; and although they sent for him to come home at once , she had climbed higher ere he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 16]: When they opened her will , they found that she had left everything to Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 59]: There was more than a hundred pounds in ready money , and property that brought in about fifty pounds a-year -- not much to one who would have spent everything on himself , but a good deal to one who loved other people , and for their sakes would contrive that a little should go a long way .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 17]: So Willie was henceforth able to relieve his father by paying all his own college expenses .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 23]: He laid by a little too , as his father wished him , until he should see how best to use it .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 15]: His father always talked about _ using _ never about _ spending _ money .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 43]: When he came home the next summer , he moved again into his own old room , for Agnes slept in a little closet off her mother 's , and much preferred that to a larger and more solitary room for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 17]: His mother especially was glad to have him under the same roof once more at night .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 30]: But Willie felt that something ought to be done with the room he had left in the ruins , for nothing ought to be allowed to spoil by uselessness .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 17]: He did not , however , see for some time to what he could turn it .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 13]: I need hardly say that he kept up all his old friendships .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 31]: No day passed while he was at home without his going to see some one of his former companions -- Mr Willett , or Mr Spelman , or Mr Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 28]: For Hector , he went to see him oftenest of all , he being his favourite , and sickly , and therefore in most need of attention .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 71]: But he greatly improved his acquaintance with William Webster ; and although he had now so much to occupy him , would not be satisfied until he was able to drive the shuttle , and work the treadles and the batten , and , in short , turn out almost as good a bit of linen as William himself -- only he wanted about twice as much time to it .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 18]: One day , going in to see Hector , he found him in bed and very poorly .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 14]: `` My shoemaking is nearly over , Mr Willie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 33]: `` But I do n't mind much ; I 'm sure to find a corner in the general business ready for me somewhere when I 'm not wanted here any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 10]: `` Have you been drinking the water lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 3]: asked Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 23]: I was very busy last week , and had n't time , and it was rather cold for me to go out .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 54]: But for that matter the wind blew in through door and window so dreadfully -- and it 's but a clay floor , and firing is dear -- that I caught a cold , and a cold is the worst thing for me -- that is for this poor rickety body of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 9]: And this cold is a bad one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 30]: Here a great fit of coughing came on , accompanied by symptoms that Willie saw were dangerous , and he went home at once to get him some medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 42]: On the way back a thought struck him , about which , however , he would say nothing to Hector until he should have talked to his father and mother about it , which he did that same evening at supper .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 35]: `` I 'll tell you what , Hector , '' he said , when he went to see him the next day -- `` you must come and occupy my room in the ruins .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 21]: Since grannie went home I do n't want it , and it 's a pity to have it lying idle .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 19]: It 's a deal warmer than this , and I 'll get a stove in before the winter .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 40]: You wo n't have to work so hard when you 've got no rent to pay , and you will have as much of the water as you like without the trouble of walking up the hill for it .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 35]: Then there 's the garden for you to walk in when you please -- all on a level , and only the little stair to climb to get back to your own room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 16]: `` But I should be such a trouble to you all , Mr Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 13]: `` You 'd be no trouble -- we 've two servants now .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 76]: If you like you can give the little one a shilling now and then , and she 'll be glad enough to make your bed , and sweep out your room ; and you know Tibby has a great regard for you , and will be very glad to do all the cooking you will want -- it 's not much , I know : your porridge and a cup of tea is about all .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 37]: And then there 's my father to look after your health , and Agnes to amuse you sometimes , and my mother to look after everything , and '' -- Here poor Hector fairly broke down .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 29]: When he recovered himself he said -- `` But how could gentle folks like you bear to see a hump-backed creature like me crawling about the place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 17]: `` They would only enjoy it the more that you enjoyed it , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 5]: It was all arranged .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 24]: As soon as Hector was able to be moved , he was carried up to the Ruins , and there nursed by everybody .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 10]: Nothing could exceed his comfort now but his gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 31]: He was soon able to work again , and as he was evidently happier when doing a little towards the general business , Mr Macmichael thought it best for him .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 35]: One day , Willie being at work in his laboratory , and getting himself half-stifled with a sudden fume of chlorine , opened the door for some air just as Hector had passed it .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 62]: He stood at the door and followed him down the walk with his eyes , watching him as he went -- now disappearing behind the blossoms of an apple-tree , now climbing one of the little mounds , and now getting up into the elm-tree , and looking about him on all sides , his sickly face absolutely shining with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 26]: `` But , '' said Willie all at once to himself , `` why should Hector be the only invalid to have this pleasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 8]: He found no answer to the question .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 12]: I do n't think he looked for one very hard though .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 28]: And again , all at once , he said to himself -- `` What if this is what my grannie 's money was given me for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 7]: That night he had a dream .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 41]: The two questions had no doubt a share in giving it him , and perhaps also a certain essay of Lord Bacon -- `` Of Building , '' namely -- which he had been reading before he went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 8]: -LSB- Illustration : WILLIE 'S DREAM . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 26]: He dreamed that , being pulled up in the middle of the night by his wheel , he went down to go into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 39]: But the moment he was out of the back door , he fancied there was something strange going on in his room in the ruins -- he could not tell what , but he must go and see .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 25]: When he climbed the stairs and opened the door , there was Hector Macallaster where he ought to be , asleep in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 41]: But there _ was _ something strange going on ; for a stream , which came dashing over the side of the wooden spout , was flowing all round Hector 's bed , and then away he knew not whither .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 19]: Another strange thing was , that in the further wall was a door which was new to him .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 41]: He opened it , and found himself in another chamber , like his own ; and there also lay some one , he knew not who , in a bed , with a stream of water flowing all around it .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 35]: There was also a second door , beyond which was a third room , and a third patient asleep , and a third stream flowing around the bed , and a third door beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 37]: He went from room to room , on and on , through about a hundred such , he thought , and at length came to a vaulted chamber , which seemed to be over the well .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 61]: From the centre of the vault rose a great chimney , and under the chimney was a huge fire , and on the fire stood a mighty golden cauldron , up to which , through a large pipe , came the water of the well , and went pouring in with a great rushing , and hissing , and bubbling .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 38]: From the other side of the cauldron , the water rushed away through another pipe into the trough that ran through all the chambers , and made the rivers that flowed the beds of the sleeping patients .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 44]: And what was most wonderful of all -- by the fire stood two angels , with grand lovely wings , and they made a great fanning with their wings , and so blew the fire up loud and strong about the golden cauldron .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 24]: And when Willie looked into their faces , he saw that one of them was his father , and the other Mr Shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 13]: And he gave a great cry of delight , and woke weeping .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 5]: WILLIE 'S PLANS BLOSSOM .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 13]: In the morning , Willie 's head was full of his dream .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 11]: How gladly would he have turned it into a reality !
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 13]: That was impossible -- but might he not do something towards it ?
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 29]: He had long ago seen that those who are doomed not to realise their ideal , are just those who will not take the first step towards it .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 17]: this is such a little thing to do , it ca n't be any use ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 3]: they say .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 23]: `` And it 's such a distance off what I mean , and what I should give my life to have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 25]: They think and they say that they would give their life for it , and yet they will not give a single hearty effort .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 42]: Hence they just stop where they are , or rather go back and back until they do not care a bit for the thoughts they used to think so great that they cherished them for the glory of having thought them .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 30]: But even the wretched people who set their hearts on making money , begin by saving the first penny they can , and then the next and the next .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 31]: And they have their reward : they get the riches they want -- with the loss of their souls to be sure , but that they did not think of .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 46]: The people on the other hand who want to be noble and good , begin by taking the first thing that comes to their hand and doing that right , and so they go on from one thing to another , growing better and better .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 73]: In the same way , although it would have been absurd in Willie to rack his brain for some scheme by which to restore such a grand building as the Priory , he could yet bethink himself that the hundredth room did not come next the first , neither did the third ; the one after the first was the second , and he might do something towards the existence of that .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 22]: He went out immediately after breakfast , and began peering about the ruins to see where the second room might be .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 28]: To his delight he saw that , with a little contrivance , it could be built on the other side of the wall of Hector 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 17]: He had plenty of money for it , his grannie 's legacy not being yet touched .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 24]: He thought it all over himself , talked it all over with his father , and then consulted it all over with Spelman .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 30]: The end was , that without nearly spending his little store , he had , before the time came for his return to the college , built another room .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 26]: As the garret was full of his grandmother 's furniture , nothing was easier than to fit it up -- and that very nicely too .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 10]: It remained only to find an occupant for it .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 46]: This would have been easy enough also without going far from the door , but both Willie and his father were practical men , and therefore could not be content with merely doing good : they wanted to do as much good as they could .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 41]: It would not therefore satisfy them to put into their new room such a person -- say , as Mrs Wilson , who could get on pretty well where she was , though she might have been made more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 86]: But suppose they could find the sickly mother of a large family , whom a few weeks of change , with the fine air from the hills and the wonderful water from the Prior 's well , would restore to strength and cheerfulness , how much more good would they not be doing in that way -- seeing that to help a mother with children is to help all the children as well , not to mention the husband and the friends of the family !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 18]: There were plenty such to be found amongst the patients he had to attend while at college .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 34]: The expense of living was not great at Priory Leas , and Mr MacMichael was willing to bear that , if only to test the influences of the water and climate upon strangers .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 38]: Although it was not by any means the best season for the experiment , it was yet thoroughly successful with the pale rheumatic mother of six , whom Willie first sent home to his father 's care .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 27]: She returned to her children at Christmas , comparatively a hale woman , capable of making them and everybody about her twice as happy as before .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 57]: Another as nearly like her in bodily condition and circumstances as he could find , took her place , -- with a like result ; and before long the healing that hovered about Priory Leas began to be known and talked of amongst the professors of the college , and the medical men of the city .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: WILLIE 'S PLANS BEAR FRUIT .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 39]: When his studies were finished , Willie returned to assist his father , for he had no desire to settle in a great city with the ambition of becoming a fashionable doctor getting large fees and growing rich .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 24]: He regarded the end of life as being , in a large measure , just to take his share in the general business .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 41]: By this time the reputation of the Prior 's Well had spread on all sides , and the country people had begun to visit the Leas , and stay for a week or ten days to drink of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 59]: Indeed so many kept coming and going at all hours through the garden , that the MacMichaels at length found it very troublesome , and had a small pipe laid to a little stone trough built into the garden wall on the outside , so that whoever would might come and drink with less trouble to all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 13]: But Willie had come home with a new idea in his head .

Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 38]: `` Why , '' said Willie to his father , `` should n't we restore a bit of the Priory in such a way that a man like Mr Yellowley could endure it for a little while ?

Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 58]: The result was that Mr MacMichael thought the thing worth trying , and resolved to lay out all his little savings , as well as what Willie could add , on getting a kitchen and a few convenient rooms constructed in the ruins -- of course keeping as much as possible to their plan and architectural character .

Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 16]: Between the three the thing was effected , and Mr Yellowley was their first visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 70]: I am sorry to say he grumbled a good deal at first at the proximity of the cobbler , and at having to meet him in his walks about the garden ; but this was a point on which Mr MacMichael , who of course took the old man 's complaints good-humouredly , would not budge , and he had to reconcile himself to it as he best might .

Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 15]: And the Priory , having once taken to growing , went on with it .

Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 30]: The only evil consequence was that the garden became a little less picturesque by their removal , although , on the other hand , a good deal more productive .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 28]: Yes , there was a second apparently bad consequence -- the Priory spread as well as grew , until it encroached not a little upon the garden .

''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 56]: and Mona had answered `` Yes '' quite decidedly ; and Willie had given her a kiss ; and Mona had taken the kiss and given him another for it ; and so it was all understood , and there was no fear of the wall having to be built up again between the gardens .
